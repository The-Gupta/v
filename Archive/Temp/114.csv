HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by loss of motor movement in response to spinal marrow cell destruction by T lymphocytes. To perform their cellular function, T cells need to be activated by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). The aim of this work was to analyze DC differentiation and activation from monocytes of HTLV-1-infected individuals. We demonstrated that monocytes from HTLV-1-infected patients who had been stimulated to differentiate had an impaired loss of CD14 expression, expressed low levels of CD1a, and maintained secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha compared with monocytes from noninfected donors. We further evaluated DC activation by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We observed that in response to activation, DCs that were derived from noninfected donors had an increase in the percentage of CD83(+), CD86(+), and human leukocyte antigen-DR(+) cells, whereas in DCs derived from HTLV-1-infected patients, the percentage of CD83(+), CD86(+), and human leukocyte antigen-DR(+) cells remained similar to that of nonactivated cells. Moreover, these cells had an impaired capacity to stimulate allogeneic T lymphocytes. We demonstrated that DC maturation was altered in HTLV-1-infected patients, which could contribute to the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Nascimento, Clarissa Rodrigues', 'Lima, Marco Antonio', 'de Andrada Serpa, Maria Jose', 'Espindola, Otavio', 'Leite, Ana Claudia Celestino', 'Echevarria-Lima, Juliana']","['Nascimento CR', 'Lima MA', 'de Andrada Serpa MJ', 'Espindola O', 'Leite AC', 'Echevarria-Lima J']","['Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)59197-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-272690 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 13;117(2):489-99. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-272690.

We report results of a phase I dose-escalation trial of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and four adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled. Lenalidomide was given orally at escalating doses of 25 to 75 mg daily on days 1 through 21 of 28-day cycles to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to provide pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data. RESULTS: Patients had a median age of 63 years (range, 22 to 79 years) and a median of two prior therapies (range, one to four therapies). The DLT was fatigue; 50 mg/d was the MTD. Infectious complications were frequent. Plasma lenalidomide concentration increased proportionally with dose. In AML, five (16%) of 31 patients achieved complete remission (CR); three of three patients with cytogenetic abnormalities achieved cytogenetic CR (none with deletion 5q). Response duration ranged from 5.6 to 14 months. All responses occurred in AML with low presenting WBC count. No patient with ALL responded. Two of four patients who received lenalidomide as initial therapy for AML relapse after allogeneic transplantation achieved durable CR after development of cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, without donor leukocyte infusion. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide was safely escalated to 50 mg daily for 21 days, every 4 weeks, and was active with relatively low toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Remissions achieved after transplantation suggest a possible immunomodulatory effect of lenalidomide, and results provide enthusiasm for further studies in AML, either alone or in combination with conventional agents or other immunotherapies.","['Blum, William', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Yang, Xiaoxia', 'Rozewski, Darlene M', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Walker, Alison', 'Chandler, Jason C', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Curfman, John', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Schaaf, Larry', 'Mickle, Jon', 'Kefauver, Cheryl', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Byrd, John C']","['Blum W', 'Klisovic RB', 'Becker H', 'Yang X', 'Rozewski DM', 'Phelps MA', 'Garzon R', 'Walker A', 'Chandler JC', 'Whitman SP', 'Curfman J', 'Liu S', 'Schaaf L', 'Mickle J', 'Kefauver C', 'Devine SM', 'Grever MR', 'Marcucci G', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. william.blum@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2010/10/20 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.30.3339 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.30.3339 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Nov 20;28(33):4919-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.30.3339.

Alterations in cis-regulatory elements of these genes play a major role in evolutionary change, but little is known about the mechanisms responsible for maintaining conserved patterns of gene expression. We have studied the evolution of cis-regulatory mechanisms controlling the SCL gene, which encodes a key transcriptional regulator of blood, vasculature, and brain development and exhibits conserved function and pattern of expression throughout vertebrate evolution. SCL cis-regulatory elements are conserved between frog and chicken but accrued alterations at an accelerated rate between 310 and 200 million years ago, with subsequent fixation of a new cis-regulatory pattern at the beginning of the mammalian radiation. As a consequence, orthologous elements shared by mammals and lower vertebrates exhibit functional differences and binding site turnover between widely separated cis-regulatory modules. However, the net effect of these alterations is constancy of overall regulatory inputs and of expression pattern. Our data demonstrate remarkable cis-regulatory remodelling across the SCL locus and indicate that stable patterns of expression can mask extensive regulatory change. These insights illuminate our understanding of vertebrate evolution.","['Gottgens, Berthold', 'Ferreira, Rita', 'Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Ishibashi, Shoko', 'Li, Juan', 'Spensberger, Dominik', 'Lefevre, Pascal', 'Ottersbach, Katrin', 'Chapman, Michael', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Hoogenkamp, Maarten', 'Follows, George A', 'Bonifer, Constanze', 'Amaya, Enrique', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Gottgens B', 'Ferreira R', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Ishibashi S', 'Li J', 'Spensberger D', 'Lefevre P', 'Ottersbach K', 'Chapman M', 'Kinston S', 'Knezevic K', 'Hoogenkamp M', 'Follows GA', 'Bonifer C', 'Amaya E', 'Green AR']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TAL1 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Biological Evolution', 'Chickens', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology/physiology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/anatomy & histology/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Vertebrates/*genetics', 'Xenopus Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00870-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00870-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Dec;30(24):5741-51. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00870-10.

Although deletion of PTEN in mouse T cells results in lethal T cell lymphomas, we find that animals lacking PTEN or SHIP in B cells show no evidence of malignancy. However, concomitant deletion of PTEN and SHIP (bPTEN/SHIP(-/-)) results in spontaneous and lethal mature B cell neoplasms consistent with marginal zone lymphoma or, less frequently, follicular or centroblastic lymphoma. bPTEN/SHIP(-/-) B cells exhibit enhanced survival and express more MCL1 and less Bim. These cells also express low amounts of p27(kip1) and high amounts of cyclin D3 and thus appear poised to undergo proliferative expansion. Unlike normal B cells, bPTEN/SHIP(-/-) B cells proliferate to the prosurvival factor B cell activating factor (BAFF). Interestingly, although BAFF availability may promote lymphoma progression, we demonstrate that BAFF is not required for the expansion of transferred bPTEN/SHIP(-/-) B cells. This study reveals that PTEN and SHIP act cooperatively to suppress B cell lymphoma and provides the first direct evidence that SHIP is a tumor suppressor. As such, assessment of both PTEN and SHIP function are relevant to understanding the etiology of human B cell malignancies that exhibit augmented activation of the PI3K pathway.","['Miletic, Ana V', 'Anzelon-Mills, Amy N', 'Mills, David M', 'Omori, Sidne A', 'Pedersen, Irene M', 'Shin, Dong-Mi', 'Ravetch, Jeffrey V', 'Bolland, Silvia', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Rickert, Robert C']","['Miletic AV', 'Anzelon-Mills AN', 'Mills DM', 'Omori SA', 'Pedersen IM', 'Shin DM', 'Ravetch JV', 'Bolland S', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Rickert RC']","['Program of Inflammatory Disease Research, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Cancer Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20101018,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tnfsf13b protein, mouse)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/immunology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin D3/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",2010/10/20 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20091962 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20091962 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2010 Oct 25;207(11):2407-20. doi: 10.1084/jem.20091962.

Here we report that CDDO-Me ameliorates diabetes in high fat diet-fed type 2 diabetic mice and in Lepr(db/db) mice. CDDO-Me reduces proinflammatory cytokine expression in these animals. Oral CDDO-Me administration reduces total body fat, plasma triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels. It also improves glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests. Its potent glucose-lowering activity results from enhanced insulin action. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp reveals an increased glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia and showed a significant increase in muscle-specific insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (71% soleus, 58% gastrocnemius) and peripheral glucose clearance as documented by a 48% increase in glucose disposal rate. CDDO-Me activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and via LKB1 activation in muscle and liver in vivo. Treatment of isolated hepatocytes with CDDO-Me directly stimulates AMPK activity and LKB1 phosphorylation and decreases acetyl-coA carboxylase activity; it also down-regulates lipogenic gene expression, suppresses gluconeogenesis, and increases glucose uptake. Inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation using compound C and lentiviral-mediated knockdown of AMPK completely blocks the CDDO-Me-induced effect on hepatocytes as well as C(2)C(12) cells. We conclude that the triterpenoid CDDO-Me has potent anti-diabetic action in diabetic mouse models that is mediated at least in part through AMPK activation.

Pluripotent stem cell lines can now be generated from an individual's own cells, facilitating the generation of immunologically acceptable stem cell-based therapeutics. Many cell types can undergo nuclear reprogramming, leading to the question of whether the identity of the reprogrammed cell of origin has a biological consequence. Peripheral blood, containing a mixture of T, B, NK, and myeloid cell types, represents one potential source of reprogrammable cells. In this study, we describe the unique case of mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell. These mice have prerearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) genes in all cells. Surprisingly, approximately 50% of mice with prerearranged TCR genes develop spontaneous T cell lymphomas, which originate in the thymus. The lymphomas arise from developing T cells, and contain activated Notch1, similar to most human and mouse T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphomas. Furthermore, lymphomagenesis requires the expression of both prerearranged TCRalpha and TCRbeta genes, indicating a critical role for TCR signaling. Furthermore, inhibitors of multiple branches of TCR signaling suppress lymphoma growth, implicating TCR signaling as an essential component in lymphoma proliferation. The lymphomagenesis in mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell demonstrates the deleterious consequences of misregulation of the TCR rearrangement and signaling pathways and illustrates one case of cellular reprogramming where the identity of the cell of origin has profound consequences.","['Serwold, Thomas', 'Hochedlinger, Konrad', 'Swindle, John', 'Hedgpeth, Joe', 'Jaenisch, Rudolf', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Serwold T', 'Hochedlinger K', 'Swindle J', 'Hedgpeth J', 'Jaenisch R', 'Weissman IL']","['Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. thomas.serwold@joslin.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', '*Cell Dedifferentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",2010/10/20 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1013230107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1013230107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Nov 2;107(44):18939-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1013230107.

We found that male progeny of iMyc(Calpha) mice mated with mice transgenic (Tg) for CD257 (B-cell activating factor, BAFF) developed CD5(+) B-cell leukemia resembling human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which also displays a male gender bias. Surprisingly, leukemic cells of Myc/Baff Tg mice expressed higher levels of c-Myc than did B cells of iMyc(Calpha) mice. We found that CLL cells of many patients with progressive disease also expressed high amounts of c-MYC, particularly CLL cells whose survival depends on nurse-like cells (NLC), which express high-levels of BAFF. We find that BAFF could enhance CLL-cell expression of c-MYC via activation the canonical IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway. Inhibition of the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway in mouse or human leukemia cells blocked the capacity of BAFF to induce c-MYC or promote leukemia-cell survival and significantly impaired disease progression in Myc/Baff Tg mice. This study reveals an important relationship between BAFF and c-MYC in CLL which may affect disease development and progression, and suggests that inhibitors of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway may be effective in treatment of patients with this disease.","['Zhang, Weizhou', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Chuang, Han-Yu', 'Enzler, Thomas', 'James, Danelle F', 'Poustovoitov, Maxim', 'Tseng, Ping-Hui', 'Janz, Siegfried', 'Hoh, Carl', 'Herschman, Harvey', 'Karin, Michael', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Zhang W', 'Kater AP', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Chuang HY', 'Enzler T', 'James DF', 'Poustovoitov M', 'Tseng PH', 'Janz S', 'Hoh C', 'Herschman H', 'Karin M', 'Kipps TJ']","['Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tnfsf13b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/immunology', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",2010/10/20 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1013420107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1013420107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Nov 2;107(44):18956-60. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1013420107.

In this study, the authors analysed the expression of the antiapoptotic oncoprotein B cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2), the tumour-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), and the heat-shock-protein HSP-90 in conjunctival melanoma (CoM) and conjunctival nevi (CoN) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: IHC was performed on 70 samples of CoM and 12 samples of CoN. Expression patterns between the diagnosis groups were compared. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic value of the antigens. RESULTS: HSP-90 (p<0.0001) and PTEN (p=0.001) showed the potential to differentiate between CoM and CoN. Bcl-2 expression was higher in CoM than in CoN (p=0.04). The loss of nuclear PTEN expression was more pronounced in the malignant melanomas than in CoN (p=0.02). Tumours located at unfavourable sites (fornix, palpebral conjunctiva, caruncle) that had developed recurrences expressed almost twice as much HSP-90 than recurrence-free tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival melanocytes differentially express Bcl-2, HSP-90 and PTEN, depending on their entity. HSP-90- and PTEN expression may add relevant information for the differentiation between conjunctival melanoma and nevi.","['Westekemper, Henrike', 'Karimi, Sara', 'Susskind, Daniela', 'Anastassiou, Gerasimos', 'Freistuhler, Michael', 'Steuhl, Klaus-Peter', 'Bornfeld, Norbert', 'Schmid, Kurt-Werner', 'Grabellus, Florian']","['Westekemper H', 'Karimi S', 'Susskind D', 'Anastassiou G', 'Freistuhler M', 'Steuhl KP', 'Bornfeld N', 'Schmid KW', 'Grabellus F']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101017,England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,"['0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Conjunctival Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nevus, Pigmented/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/07/21 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bjo.2010.183939 [pii]', '10.1136/bjo.2010.183939 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 2011 Jun;95(6):853-8. doi: 10.1136/bjo.2010.183939.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the influence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR 66A > G) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on total body BMD (BMD(TB)) and lumbar spine BMD (BMD(LS)) in 83 patients. Homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 were determined. BMD was measured repeatedly using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in patients >/= 4 years (n = 68). RESULTS: Carriers of the MTHFR 677 T-allele showed a lower baseline BMD(TB) than non-carriers (-0.38 SDS vs. +0.55 SDS, p = 0.01) and BMD(TB) remained lower during/after treatment. MTHFR 677C>T did not influence treatment-related loss of BMD(TB) (p = 0.39). The MTRR 66 G-allele carriers showed a trend towards a lower BMD(TB) compared with non-carriers. Combining these two SNPs, patients carrying >/= 2 risk alleles had a significantly lower BMD(TB) (-1.40 SDS) than patients with one (-0.80 SDS) or no risk alleles (-0.31 SDS). Although carriers of the MTHFR 1298A > C had higher homocysteine levels, this SNP was not related to BMD(TB). BMD(LS) of carriers was similar to non-carriers of the investigated SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: The MTHFR 677C>T SNP and the MTRR 66A >G SNP were identified as determinants of impaired BMD(TB) in childhood ALL patients.","['te Winkel, M L', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama, S M P F', 'de Jonge, R', 'van Beek, R D', 'van der Sluis, I M', 'Hop, W C J', 'Pieters, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['te Winkel ML', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama SM', 'de Jonge R', 'van Beek RD', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Hop WC', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101016,United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.18.1.- (methionine synthase reductase)', 'EC 1.18.1.2 (Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Density/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase/*genetics', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Fractures, Bone/complications/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells/*metabolism', 'Homocysteine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnostic imaging/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vitamin B 12/metabolism']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S8756-3282(10)01980-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2010.10.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2011 Mar 1;48(3):571-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2010.10.163.

However, currently it is unclear which clinical variables are important and which patient groups are most suitable to be discharged early. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: The study group of 55 patients underwent 82 admission periods for a total of 2269 patient days, which could be classified into four categories: induction treatment, consolidation treatment and autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Different clinical variables potentially interfering with early discharge were subsequently analysed for their association with each treatment group. RESULTS: The median duration of admission was 27 days. The incidence of fever (82.9%) and use of intravenous antibiotics (79.3%) was high in all treatment groups. The only statistically significant differences between groups were found for performance status and mucositis. In the patient group undergoing consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia, the performance status was better and mucositis was less severe. The decline in performance status and the severity of mucositis were as expected most obvious 10-14 days after the start of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy appear to be the most suitable candidates for early discharge, especially in the first-week postchemotherapy treatment. Early discharge can also be considered in patients with a good performance status in the autologous stem cell transplantation group, directly after transplantation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: An important factor in developing an early discharge programme is a good infrastructure, both at home and in the hospital.","['Mank, Arno', 'van der Lelie, Johannes', 'de Vos, Rien', 'Kersten, Marie Jose']","['Mank A', 'van der Lelie J', 'de Vos R', 'Kersten MJ']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. a.p.mank@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100908,England,J Clin Nurs,Journal of clinical nursing,9207302,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucositis/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/nursing/*therapy', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology', 'Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03473.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Nurs. 2011 Feb;20(3-4):388-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03473.x.

Early identification of pHES that may evolve towards a lymphomyeloproliferative disease is relevant in light of prognostic and therapeutic implications. Molecular features of 10 pHES patients were analysed at presentation and during their clinical course, including analysis of BCR-ABL1 and FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion genes, quantitation of WT1 gene copy number and clonality of T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH). All patients had normal karyotype and germline TCR configuration. Five children showed IGH clonality at presentation: of these, two developed a B non-Hodgkin lymphoma and a B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukaemia at six and 12 months respectively, two spontaneously reverted to a polyclonal IGH profile during the follow-up, and the last one persisted with pHES without B-clonal evolution after 19 months. One patient had a PDGFRA/FIP1L1 fusion and achieved hematologic and molecular remission after imatinib therapy. IGH rearrangement was observed to be a frequent molecular feature of pHES and may precede B-cell clonal expansion and evolution into B-cell malignancies in children.","['Rapanotti, Maria Cristina', 'Caruso, Roberta', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Zaza, Serena', 'Trotta, Laura', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Funaro, Daria', 'Federici, Giorgio', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'De Rossi, Giulio', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Rapanotti MC', 'Caruso R', 'Ammatuna E', 'Zaza S', 'Trotta L', 'Divona M', 'Cicconi L', 'Funaro D', 'Federici G', 'Amadori S', 'De Rossi G', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. cristinarapanotti@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101019,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Prognosis']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08394.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Dec;151(5):440-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08394.x.

To investigate relationships between JMML and CMML, genes recently involved in CMML were studied in 68 JMML patients. Mutations in TET2, RUNX1 and JAK2(V617F) are involved in myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative syndromes, and more specifically in CMML but were not found in JMML. Pangenomic analysis by SNP-array showed no abnormality at these loci. Three frameshift mutations of ASXL1 leading to a truncated protein were found in three patients (4%) with late onset JMML displaying also RAS activating mutations. Homozygous mutations of CBL with 11q loss of heterozygosity were found in five (7%) JMML. CBL substitutions were different from those reported in CMML, exclusive from other RAS activating mutations, and were germline in all patients. Overall, the pattern of genetic lesions observed in JMML differed from that of CMML. Although signalling deregulation is involved in CMML, transcriptional deregulation seems to play a pivotal role, with mutation of RUNX1, ASXL1 or TET2. Conversely, none of these genes involved in transcription or chromatin remodelling was found to be significantly altered in JMML, while CBL mutations confirm the central role of RAS and growth factor signalling deregulation in JMML.","['Perez, Benoite', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Lachenaud, Julie', 'Kaltenbach, Sophie', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Cave, Helene']","['Perez B', 'Kosmider O', 'Cassinat B', 'Renneville A', 'Lachenaud J', 'Kaltenbach S', 'Bertrand Y', 'Baruchel A', 'Chomienne C', 'Fontenay M', 'Preudhomme C', 'Cave H']","['Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Robert Debre, Departement de Genetique; Universite Paris 7-Denis Diderot, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101019,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08393.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Dec;151(5):460-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08393.x.

Thus, in tumor cells, RNA polymerase II is more active than in other somatic cells. Amanita phalloides contains amanitin, inhibiting RNA polymerase II. Partial inhibition with amanitin influences tumor cell--but not normal cell--activity. OBJECTIVES: To widen the treatment spectrum, homeopathic dilutions of Amanita phalloides, containing amanitin, were given to a patient with leukemia. Monitoring the leukemic cell count, different doses of amanitin were given. RESULTS: The former duplication time of leukemic cells was 21 months. Within a period of 21 months, the cell count is stabilized to around 10(5)/muL. No leukemia-associated symptoms, liver damage, or continuous erythrocyte deprivation occur.

However, there is a risk of inducing uncontrollable fatal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In fact, allo-BMT plus intravenous (IV)-DLI using donor splenocytes induces fatal GVHD in recipient mice. In this study, we examined the effects of the combination of intra-bone marrow (IBM)-BMT and the subcutaneous injection of donor splenocytes (SC-DLI) on the allo-BMT system. Recipient BALB/c mice were conditioned by sublethal irradiation (5 Gy), followed by IBM-BMT plus IV-DLI or SC-DLI in C57BL/6 mice. The IV-DLI group showed better engraftment of donor hemopoietic cells than the control group (without DLI) but showed fatal GVHD. The SC-DLI group, however, showed good reconstitution and mild GVHD. These results suggest that the combination of SC-DLI and IBM-BMT promotes the reconstitution of hemopoiesis and helps reduce the risk of GVHD.","['Shi, Ming', 'Adachi, Yasushi', 'Cui, Yunze', 'Li, Ming', 'Lian, Zhexiong', 'Zhang, Yuming', 'Yanai, Seiji', 'Shima, Chieko', 'Imai, Yuichiro', 'Ikehara, Susumu']","['Shi M', 'Adachi Y', 'Cui Y', 'Li M', 'Lian Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Yanai S', 'Shima C', 'Imai Y', 'Ikehara S']","['Department of Stem Cell Disorders, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi City, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101222,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Injections, Intravenous/adverse effects', 'Injections, Subcutaneous/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Risk', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2010.0232 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2011 May;20(5):759-68. doi: 10.1089/scd.2010.0232.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human tumor cell lines, ONS76 and MOLT4, were irradiated with 200 MeV protons or 10 MV X-rays. In situ DNA double-strand breaks (DDSB) induction was evaluated by immunocytochemical staining of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX). Apoptosis was measured by flow-cytometry after staining with Annexin V. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was obtained by clonogenic survival assay. RESULTS: DDSB induction was significantly higher for protons than X-rays with average ratios of 1.28 (ONS76) and 1.59 (MOLT4) at 30 min after irradiation. However the differences became insignificant at 6 h. Also, apoptosis induction in MOLT4 cells was significantly higher for protons than X-rays with an average ratio of 2.13 at 12 h. However, the difference became insignificant at 20 h. RBE values of protons to X-rays at 10% survival were 1.06 +/- 0.04 and 1.02 +/- 0.15 for ONS76 and MOLT4, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cell inactivation may differ according to different timings and/or endpoints. Proton beams demonstrated higher cell inactivation than X-rays in the early phases. These data may facilitate the understanding of the biological properties of clinical proton beams.","['Gerelchuluun, Ariungerel', 'Hong, Zhengshan', 'Sun, Lue', 'Suzuki, Kenshi', 'Terunuma, Toshiyuki', 'Yasuoka, Kiyoshi', 'Sakae, Takeji', 'Moritake, Takashi', 'Tsuboi, Koji']","['Gerelchuluun A', 'Hong Z', 'Sun L', 'Suzuki K', 'Terunuma T', 'Yasuoka K', 'Sakae T', 'Moritake T', 'Tsuboi K']","['Proton Medical Research Center, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Protons)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Medulloblastoma/metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Particle Accelerators', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy', '*Protons', 'Radiotherapy, High-Energy/instrumentation', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Synchrotrons', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2010/10/20 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/10/20 06:00'],"['2010/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2010.518201 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2011 Jan;87(1):57-70. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2010.518201.

The pleural specimen was comprised of blast forms having large round nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin and prominent nucleoli, with scattered binucleate forms. The blasts expressed CD45 and CD34 and were negative for epithelial and mesothelial markers. Previous bone marrow biopsies had shown that the blasts exhibited strong staining for hemoglobin and lacked expression of Factor VIII and myeloperoxidase, consistent with erythroid differentiation.

Recent studies showed that a combination of taxane and ADI-PEG20, which induces caspase-independent apoptosis, is more effective than taxane monotherapy for prostate cancer. The main limitation of ADI from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida (PpADI) and of many other ADI enzymes lies in their pH-dependent activity profile. PpADI has a pH optimum at 6.5 and a pH shift from 6.5 to 7.5 results in an approximately 80 % activity drop (the pH of human plasma is 7.35 to 7.45). In 2010, we reported a proof of concept for ADI engineering by directed evolution that resulted in variant M2 (K5T/D44E/H404R). M2 has a pH optimum of pH 7.0, a fourfold higher k(cat) value than the wild-type PpADI (pH 7.4, 0.5 M phosphate buffer), and an increased K(m) value for substrate arginine.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in leukemia cell differentiation have not been fully elucidated. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on a variety of cell types, and plays important roles in hematopoiesis. GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) is an important transcription factor involved in either megakaryocytic or erythrocytic differentiation. Herein we report that Rab7b, a late endosome/lysosome-localized myeloid small GTPase, promotes phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation by increasing nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent IL-6 production and subsequently enhancing the association of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with GATA-1. By using PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of leukemia cells as a model, we investigated the roles of Rab7b in megakaryocytic differentiation. We find that Rab7b can potentiate PMA-induced upregulation of megakaryocytic markers, production of IL-6, and activation of NF-kappaB. Inhibitor of NF-kappaB and neutralizing antibodies for IL-6 or the IL-6 signaling receptor gp130 can block the effects of Rab7b in megakaryocytic differentiation. In Rab7b-silenced cells, PMA-induced activation of NF-kappaB, IL-6 production, and megakaryocytic differentiation are impaired. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 and the subsequent association of STAT3 with GATA-1 may contribute to PMA-induced and Rab7b-mediated transcriptional upregulation of megakaryocytic differentiation markers. Therefore, our data suggest that Rab7b may play important roles in megakaryopoiesis by activating NF-kappaB and promoting IL-6 production. Our study also indicates that the IL-6-induced association of STAT3 with GATA-1 may regulate megakaryocytic differentiation.","['He, Donghua', 'Chen, Taoyong', 'Yang, Mingjin', 'Zhu, Xuhui', 'Wang, Chen', 'Cao, Xuetao', 'Cai, Zhen']","['He D', 'Chen T', 'Yang M', 'Zhu X', 'Wang C', 'Cao X', 'Cai Z']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 38 Zheda Road, Hangzhou, 310027, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101016,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-010-0689-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2011 Feb;89(2):137-50. doi: 10.1007/s00109-010-0689-z.

Our results revealed that TRAIL selectively triggered apoptosis in the P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and DR5 overexpressing CEM/VBL1000 multidrug resistant leukemia cell line, but not in the parental CEM cells. Moreover, TRAIL treatment reduced P-gp expression in these cells. Mechanistic analysis of TRAIL-induced apoptosis revealed that TRAIL hypersensitivity is due to robust upregulation of the TRAIL receptor DR5 at the protein and mRNA levels during development of MDR in the CEM/VBL1000 variant. DR5 upregulation was independent of the level of expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress regulator C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CH0P/GADD153). TRAIL-triggered apoptosis was associated with increased expression of FADD; activation of caspases-3, -8, -9, and -10; and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Therefore, both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways are involved in this process. These findings for the first time reveal that TRAIL treatment selectively causes apoptosis in P-gp-overexpressing CEM/VBL1000 cells through strong upregulation of DR5. Moreover, this hypersensitivity to TRAIL and its effect on reducing P-gp expression in these cells hold significant clinical implications for using TRAIL to eradicate MDR malignant cells.","['Park, Soo-Jung', 'Bijangi-Vishehsaraei, Khadijeh', 'Safa, Ahmad R']","['Park SJ', 'Bijangi-Vishehsaraei K', 'Safa AR']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100718,United States,Int J Biochem Mol Biol,International journal of biochemistry and molecular biology,101532076,,,,2010/10/19 06:00,2010/10/19 06:01,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/19 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Biochem Mol Biol. 2010;1(1):90-100.

To reduce these risks, we established a method of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cell (Treg) enrichment from cryopreserved UCB followed by a 18 (+) 1-day expansion culture including anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads and recombinant human interleukin-2. In a ""first-in-human"" clinical trial, we evaluated the safety profile of UCB Treg in 23 patients. Patients received a dose of 0.1-30 x 10(5)UCB Treg/kg after double UCB transplantation. The targeted Treg dose was achieved in 74% of cultures, with all products being suppressive in vitro (median 86% suppression at a 1:4 ratio). No infusional toxicities were observed. After infusion, UCB Treg could be detected for 14 days, with the greatest proportion of circulating CD4(+)CD127(-)FoxP3(+) cells observed on day (+)2. Compared with identically treated 108 historical controls without Treg, there was a reduced incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD (43% vs 61%, P = .05) with no deleterious effect on risks of infection, relapse, or early mortality. These results set the stage for a definitive study of UCB Treg to determine its potency in preventing allogeneic aGVHD.

CD94 molecules covalently associate to activating or inhibitory NKG2 molecules, and their expression finely tunes cell responses. Human gammadelta T cells express several NKRs. Expression of these receptors is confined to the cytolytic Vdelta2 subset, which coexpresses the FcgammaRIII CD16 and CD45RA and has been defined as Vgamma9Vdelta2 T(EMRA) cells. We show that the CD94/NKG2C complex, associated with KARAP/DAP12, is fully functional in gammadelta T cells, as determined by measuring IFN-gamma production, T cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity by gammadelta lymphocytes. In contrast, NKG2A expression was found on all gammadelta T cell memory subsets, suggesting a crucial role of the inhibitory signal provided by this receptor on gammadelta T cell responses. Moreover, we found Vgamma9Vdelta2 T(EMRA), NK, and CD8+ alphabeta T cells coexpressing NKG2A and NKG2C receptors. Functional experiments showed that the inhibitory signal mediated by the NKG2A receptor prevails when double-positive cells are activated. Finally, NKG2A expression on gammadelta LDGL correlates with asymptomatic pathology, even in the presence of NKG2C coexpression, whereas in symptomatic patients affected by severe disease, the inhibitory NKG2A receptor is absent, and a variety of activatory NKRs was found. We propose that the silent behavior of gammadelta cells in LDGL patients is a result of effective inhibitory HLA class I receptors.","['Angelini, Daniela F', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Galandrini, Ricciarda', 'Diamantini, Adamo', 'Placido, Roberta', 'Micucci, Federica', 'Poccia, Fabrizio', 'Semenzato, Giuseppe', 'Borsellino, Giovanna', 'Santoni, Angela', 'Battistini, Luca']","['Angelini DF', 'Zambello R', 'Galandrini R', 'Diamantini A', 'Placido R', 'Micucci F', 'Poccia F', 'Semenzato G', 'Borsellino G', 'Santoni A', 'Battistini L']","['Neuroimmunology Unit, Fondazione Santa Lucia, Scientific Institute (I.R.C.C.S.), Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101015,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Health', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0710413 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0710413 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2011 Jan;89(1):75-84. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0710413.

A phase I dose escalation study of sorafenib was conducted in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty patients received one of two different schedules; Schedule ""A"": once or twice daily, five days per week, every week for a 21 day cycle, and Schedule ""B"": once or twice daily, for 14 days every 21 days. Dose limiting toxicities were grade 3/4 hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia, and amylase elevation. The recommended phase II dose in hematologic malignancies is 400 mg twice daily for both schedules. RESULTS: Complete remissions or complete remissions with incomplete recovery of platelets were achieved in 5 (10%) patients (all with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication). Significant reduction in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood blasts was seen in an additional 17 (34%) patients (all with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication). Eleven of these responses (including 3 complete remissions/complete remissions with incomplete recovery) lasted for 2 cycles or beyond. In conclusion, sorafenib is active and well tolerated in acute myelogenous leukemia with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutation. Conclusions Additional studies of sorafenib in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, particularly those with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication, are warranted, including sorafenib-based combinations.

Liposomal cytarabine has a prolonged half-life and, given intrathecally, has produced high response rates in patients with central nervous system relapse of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of liposomal cytarabine in central nervous system relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Liposomal cytarabine (50 mg) was given intrathecally together with systemic or intrathecal dexamethasone once every 2 weeks in a phase II European trial. The primary end-point, cytological response in the cerebrospinal fluid after one or two cycles, was evaluated at the time of next treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen heavily pretreated patients (median age, 53 years; range 24-76 years) were evaluable: 14 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 5 with Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia). Complete cytological remission as best response after two cycles of liposomal cytarabine was confirmed in 74% of the patients: 86% of those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 40% of those with Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia). Nine of the 14 patients who achieved complete remission relapsed after a median of 7 months. The median overall survival was 11 months. Adverse events were observed in 89% of the patients (57% of cycles). Grade III-IV events with potential correlation to liposomal cytarabine occurred in 32% of the patients. The most frequent adverse event was headache. One patient developed severe neurological complications with loss of vision and a conus syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, liposomal cytarabine showed excellent antileukemic activity. Toxicity was acceptable but appeared to increase with the number of cycles.

Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have shown potential in vitro and in vivo as therapeutic agents against a range of tumors including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to evaluate drug-induced cell death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patients' samples. Human xenografts in immunocompromised mice were used to assess the in vivo effects of selected combinations. Pharmacological inhibitors and lentiviral small interfering ribonucleic acid knock-down of p53 were used to investigate the mechanism of cell killing involved. RESULTS: Synergistic interactions between RAD001 and cytotoxic agents were demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, with increased caspase-dependent killing. RAD001 suppressed p53 and p21 responses, while suppression of p53 did not prevent killing, indicating p53 independence. RAD001 and cytotoxic agents activated the JUN N-terminal kinase pathway and the combination further increased JUN N-terminal kinase activation. JUN N-terminal kinase inhibition reduced synergistic cell killing by cytotoxic agents and RAD001 in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patients' samples. Bortezomib and MG132, which activate the JUN N-terminal kinase pathway, also synergized with RAD001 in killing pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Killing was greater when RAD001 was combined with proteasome inhibitors than with cytotoxic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that combining mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or selected novel agents has the potential to improve clinical responses in patients with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Saunders, Philip', 'Cisterne, Adam', 'Weiss, Jocelyn', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Saunders P', 'Cisterne A', 'Weiss J', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead, NSW, 2145, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101015,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leupeptins/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.026997 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.026997 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Jan;96(1):69-77. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.026997.

In this study, we show that BCR-ABL-positive CML cell lines treated with imatinib (STI571) undergo G(1) cell cycle arrest associated with the accumulation of p57(Kip)(2), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). Interestingly, p57(Kip)(2) increase precedes the reported STI571-dependent upregulation of p27(Kip)(1). A number of complementary approaches allow the demonstration that p57(Kip)(2) buildup is due to the transcriptional activation of CDKN1C, the p57(Kip)(2)-encoding gene, while neither p57(Kip)(2) half-life elongation nor its cell relocalization were observed. We also identified a heretofore undescribed pattern of p57(Kip)(2) phosphorylated isoforms which, however, did not change in response to STI571 cell treatment. The imatinib-dependent p57(Kip)(2) upregulation occurs only in STI571-responsive cells, while the CKI accumulation was not evidenced in an imatinib-resistant clone. Nilotinib and dasatinib (second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors), at concentrations comparable to those used in therapy, increase the CKI but do not affect p27(Kip)(1) level. Finally, CD34(+) cells from CML patients display a clear imatinib-dependent p57(Kip)(2) upregulation, which was not observed in CD34(+) cells from control subjects. In conclusion, our study points to p57(Kip)(2) as a novel and precocious effector of BCR-ABL targeting drugs.","['Borriello, Adriana', 'Caldarelli, Ilaria', 'Bencivenga, Debora', 'Cucciolla, Valeria', 'Oliva, Adriana', 'Usala, Emilio', 'Danise, Paolo', 'Ronzoni, Luisa', 'Perrotta, Silverio', 'Della Ragione, Fulvio']","['Borriello A', 'Caldarelli I', 'Bencivenga D', 'Cucciolla V', 'Oliva A', 'Usala E', 'Danise P', 'Ronzoni L', 'Perrotta S', 'Della Ragione F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics ""Francesco Cedrangolo"", Second University of Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101015,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/01/29 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq211 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq211 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2011 Jan;32(1):10-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq211.

We review the ophthalmic findings in two cases of hematolymphoid malignancies limited to the intravascular space and review published literature on this topic. In cases of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, underexpression of beta1-integrin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by the cells of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma results in diffuse ocular vascular involvement. The widespread degree of intravascular involvement correlates with clinical ophthalmologic findings and may lead to retinal and choroidal detachment that is observed postmortem. Conversely, in the context of acute leukemia, induced overexpression of certain adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) in the endothelium of certain vascular beds may result in leukostasis with only selective (choroidal) ocular vessel involvement. As a result of only focal vascular activation and adhesion in the orbit, the gross findings in these cases are minimal and may not correlate with clinical ophthalmologic findings.","['Papalas, John A', 'Proia, Alan D', 'Cummings, Thomas J']","['Papalas JA', 'Proia AD', 'Cummings TJ']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. papal002@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20100708,United States,Ann Diagn Pathol,Annals of diagnostic pathology,9800503,"['0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Vessels/metabolism/*pathology', 'Eye/blood supply/*pathology', 'Eye Neoplasms/blood supply/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Leukostasis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1092-9134(10)00065-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2010.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Diagn Pathol. 2011 Aug;15(4):286-90. doi: 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2010.04.006.

The B7Y33 mutant is a mouse-human chimeric version of the B7 MAb, a polyreactive alpha-type anti-idiotypic antibody, generated against an anti-GM2 ganglioside IgM Ab1 antibody. It retained the unusual self-binding activity and multispecificity of the parental murine antibody, being able to recognize several anti-ganglioside IgM antibodies as well as non-immunoglobulin antigens. Previous work with the murine B7 MAb suggested that this antibody might have immunoregulatory properties, and therefore we investigated the possible interaction of B7Y33 with immune cells. We found that B7Y33 binds to human and murine B lymphocytes. Inhibition assays using flow cytometry indicated that this antibody is capable of binding the Fc gamma receptor II (FcgammaRII). The recognition of FcgammaRII-expressing K562, Raji and Daudi human cell lines, together with the capability of inhibiting the binding of an anti-human FcgammaRII antibody to these cells, suggest that B7Y33 interacts with both the FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIb isoforms. We evaluated the contribution to the binding of different surface-exposed residues at the top of the heavy chain variable region (VH) CDR loops through the construction of mutants with substitutions in the three conventional VH CDRs (HCDRs) and the ""HCDR4"", located in the framework 3 (HFR3). In addition, we assessed the involvement of the Fc region by performing key mutations in the CH2 domain. Furthermore, chimeric hybrid molecules were obtained by combining the B7Y33 heavy chain with unrelated light chains. Our results indicate that the multispecificity and self-binding properties of B7Y33 are not linked to its recognition of B lineage cells, and that this phenomenon occurs in a non-classical way with the participation of both the variable and constant regions of the antibody. Two possible models for this interaction are proposed, with B7Y33 binding to two FcgammaRIIb molecules through the Fc and Fv regions, or simultaneously to FcgammaRIIb and another unknown antigen on B cells. The FcgammaRIIb has recently received great attention as an attractive target for therapies directed to B lymphocytes. The recognition of peripheral B lymphocytes from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients by B7Y33 suggests its potential application for the treatment of B cell malignancies.","['Hernandez, Tays', 'de Acosta, Cristina Mateo', 'Lopez-Requena, Alejandro', 'Moreno, Ernesto', 'Alonso, Ruby', 'Fernandez-Marrero, Yuniel', 'Perez, Rolando']","['Hernandez T', 'de Acosta CM', 'Lopez-Requena A', 'Moreno E', 'Alonso R', 'Fernandez-Marrero Y', 'Perez R']","['Immunobiology Division, Center of Molecular Immunology, P.O.

These observations indicate that CML cells can convert their morphology and function to adherent myofibroblasts, and produce a significant amount of cytokine to give a growth-promotion activity to CML cells.","['Shirasaki, Ryosuke', 'Tashiro, Haruko', 'Mizutani-Noguchi, Mitsuho', 'Kawasugi, Kazuo', 'Shirafuji, Naoki']","['Shirasaki R', 'Tashiro H', 'Mizutani-Noguchi M', 'Kawasugi K', 'Shirafuji N']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101016,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Myofibroblasts/metabolism/*pathology/physiology', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/06/23 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00467-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 May;35(5):663-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.09.019.

Further analysis using clinical biopsy specimens revealed autophagy and increased levels of BCL2, S1P1, and ICAM1 in human T-LBL compared with T-ALL. Inhibition of S1P1 signaling in T-LBL cells led to decreased homotypic adhesion in vitro and increased tumor cell intravasation in vivo.

Suppressing this signaling through matings with FLT3 ligand knockout mice prevents leukemia development.

Rarely, acute leukemia can develop de novo in engrafted cells of donor origin. Donor cell leukemia (DCL) was first recognized in 1971, but for many years, the paucity of reported cases suggested it to be a rare phenomenon. However, in recent years, an upsurge in reported cases (in parallel with advances in molecular chimerism monitoring) suggest that it may be significantly more common than previously appreciated; emerging evidence suggests that DCL might represent up to 5% of all posttransplant leukemia ""relapses."" Recognition of DCL is important for several reasons. Donor-derivation of the leukemic clone has implications when selecting appropriate therapy, because seeking to enhance an allogeneic GVL effect would intuitively not have the same role as in standard recipient-derived relapses. There are also broader implications for donor selection and workup, particularly given the growing popularity of nonmyeloblative HSCT and corresponding rising age of the potential donor pool. Identification of DCL raises potential concerns over future health of the donor, posing ethical dilemmas regarding responsibilities toward donor notification (particularly in the context of cord blood transplantation). The entity of DCL is also of research interest, because it might provide a unique human model for studying the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in vivo. This review presents and collates all reported cases of DCL, and discusses the various strategies, controversies, and pitfalls when investigating origin of posttransplant relapse. Putative etiologic factors and mechanisms are proposed, and attempts made to address the difficult ethical questions posed by discovery of donor-derived malignancy within a HSCT recipient.","['Wiseman, Daniel H']",['Wiseman DH'],"['Haematology Department, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, United Kingdom. daniel.wiseman@cmft.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101015,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Chimerism', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00448-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jun;17(6):771-89. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.10.010.

The host-virus interaction causes asymptomatic carriers to develop HAM/TSP. Biomarkers are needed to predict patients who are at risk for HAM/TSP. Tax is highly immunogenic and is a major target protein recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Anti-Tax antibodies are involved in HAM/TSP pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: To assess anti-Tax IgG reactivity with a flow cytometry assay (FCA) using an infection/transfection system with Vaccinia virus and pLW44/Tax-expressing Tax and to correlate the anti-Tax response and the HTLV-1 proviral load. STUDY DESIGN: : We enrolled 81 individuals: 9 HTLV-1 seronegative (NP) and 72 HTLV-1 positive (23 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC), 12 oligosymptomatic patients (OL), 7 with rheumatologic diseases (DR) and 30 with HAM/TSP (HT)). Anti-Tax reactivity was assessed by FCA, and HTLV-1 proviral load was measured with real time PCR. RESULTS: The HT and DR groups showed greater anti-Tax IgG reactivity (p<0.001 and p<0.05 comparing HT to the OL and AC group, respectively; p<0.05 comparing DR to the OL group), and the reactivity in the DR+HT group was significantly different when compared to the AC group (p<0.05) and to the OL group (p<0.001). The proviral load was higher in the HT group compared to the OL (p<0.001) and in the HT+DR group compared to OL (p<0.001). There was no correlation between anti-Tax IgG reactivity and proviral load in any of the HTLV-1-infected groups.

When the cytotoxic activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated, compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity with IC(50) values of 4.44 and 0.63 muM against HL-60 (leukemia) and HCT-116 (colon cancer) cell lines, respectively. Compound 2 showed potent cytotoxicity with an IC(50) of 6.50 muM against HCT-116, whereas it was less cytotoxic against HL-60 (IC(50)=41.45 muM). After HL-60 and HCT-116 were treated with compounds 1 and 2, increased production of apoptotic bodies was observed. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 in HCT-116 cells activated intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways by upregulating DR-5 and Bax, downregulating Bcl-2, activating caspase-9, and cleaving poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). We also observed the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK by both compounds in the HCT-116 cells. Together, compounds 1 and 2 might induce intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways through the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in HCT-116 colon cancer cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that a carboxyl group at position-28 is potentially responsible for the cytotoxic effects.","['Liang, Chun', 'Ding, Yan', 'Nguyen, Huu Tung', 'Kim, Jeong-Ah', 'Boo, Hye-Jin', 'Kang, Hee-Kyoung', 'Nguyen, Mahn Cuong', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Liang C', 'Ding Y', 'Nguyen HT', 'Kim JA', 'Boo HJ', 'Kang HK', 'Nguyen MC', 'Kim YH']","['College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (oleanane)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Panax/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0960-894X(10)01375-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.09.074 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2010 Dec 1;20(23):7110-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.09.074.

This investigation revealed that those problems might be relaxed by simultaneous application with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the major components from green tea. EGCG significantly lowered down the ATO concentration required for an effective control of APL cells, HL-60. The simultaneous treatment of ATO with EGCG induced a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells significantly, which accounted for more than 70% of the cell death in the treatment. The mechanism of apoptosis induction was elucidated. EGCG in HL-60 cells acted as a pro-oxidant enhancing intracellular hydrogen peroxide significantly. ATO, on the other hand, induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to catalyze heme degradation, thereby provided ferrous iron for EGCG-induced hydrogen peroxide to precede Fenton reaction, which in turn generated deleterious reactive oxygen species to damage cell. In addition, EGCG inhibited expression of ferritin, which supposedly to sequester harmful ferrous iron, thereby augmented the occurrence of Fenton reaction. This investigation also provided evidence that ATO, since mainly acted to induce HO-1 in simultaneous treatment with EGCG, could be replaced by other HO-1 inducer with much less human toxicity. Furthermore, several of our preliminary investigations revealed that the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by combining heme degradation and Fenton reaction is selectively toxic to malignant but not non-malignant cells.","['Lee, Te-Chang', 'Cheng, I-Cheng', 'Shue, Jun-Jie', 'Wang, T C']","['Lee TC', 'Cheng IC', 'Shue JJ', 'Wang TC']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101013,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Oxides)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'G960R9S5SK (caffeic acid phenethyl ester)', 'ML9LGA7468 (Phenylethyl Alcohol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Caffeic Acids/toxicity', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ferritins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol/analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",2010/10/19 06:00,2010/12/18 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(10)00381-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2010.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2011 Jan 1;250(1):69-77. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2010.10.005.

The multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib has antitumor activity in solid tumors and its effects on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are still unclear. METHODS: ALL cell lines (SEM, RS4;11 and Jurkat) were treated with Sorafenib alone or in combination with cytarabine, doxorubicin or RAD001. Cell count, apoptosis and necrosis rates, cell cycle distribution, protein phosphorylation and metabolic activity were determined. RESULTS: Sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of ALL cells by cell cycle arrest accompanied by down-regulation of CyclinD3 and CDK4. Furthermore, Sorafenib initiated apoptosis by cleavage of caspases 3, 7 and PARP. Apoptosis and necrosis rates increased significantly with most pronounced effects after 96 h. Antiproliferative effects of Sorafenib were associated with a decreased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308), FoxO3A (Thr32) and 4EBP-1 (Ser65 and Thr70) as early as 0.5 h after treatment. Synergistic effects were seen when Sorafenib was combined with other cytotoxic drugs or a mTOR inhibitor emphasizing the Sorafenib effect. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib displays significant antileukemic activity in vitro by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, it influences PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in ALL cells.","['Schult, Catrin', 'Dahlhaus, Meike', 'Ruck, Sabine', 'Sawitzky, Mandy', 'Amoroso, Francesca', 'Lange, Sandra', 'Etro, Daniela', 'Glass, Aenne', 'Fuellen, Georg', 'Boldt, Sonja', 'Wolkenhauer, Olaf', 'Neri, Luca Maria', 'Freund, Mathias', 'Junghanss, Christian']","['Schult C', 'Dahlhaus M', 'Ruck S', 'Sawitzky M', 'Amoroso F', 'Lange S', 'Etro D', 'Glass A', 'Fuellen G', 'Boldt S', 'Wolkenhauer O', 'Neri LM', 'Freund M', 'Junghanss C']","['University of Rostock, Division of Medicine, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Rostock, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101015,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 7/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-560 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-560 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Oct 15;10:560. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-560.,,PMC2972283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease. To identify new cellular pathways affected by imatinib treatment, we applied mass spectrometry together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the comparative study of protein expression in K562 cells that were untreated or treated with a clinically relevant concentration of imatinib. Our results revealed that, among the 1344 quantified proteins, 73 had significantly altered levels of expression induced by imatinib and could be quantified in both forward and reverse SILAC labeling experiments. These included the down-regulation of thymidylate synthase, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as well as the up-regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, hemoglobins, and enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis. We also found, by assessing alteration in the acetylation level in histone H4 upon imatinib treatment, that the imatinib-induced hemoglobinization and erythroid differentiation in K562 cells are associated with global histone H4 hyperacetylation. Overall, these results provided potential biomarkers for monitoring the therapeutic intervention of CML using imatinib and offered important new knowledge for gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of imatinib.","['Xiong, Lei', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Yuan, Bifeng', 'Dong, Xiaoli', 'Jiang, Xinning', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Xiong L', 'Zhang J', 'Yuan B', 'Dong X', 'Jiang X', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521-0403, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101015,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2010/10/19 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr100814y [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2010 Nov 5;9(11):6007-15. doi: 10.1021/pr100814y.

Extreme hiperuricaemia is seen in cancer patients with tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) which is classically associated with haematological malignancies with rapid tumour growth rates such as acute lymphoid leukaemia and high grade lymphomas. Primary melofibrosis (Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia-AMM) is a chronic myeloproliferative disease characterized by splenomegaly, a leukoerythroblastic blood picture, teardrop poikilocytosis and varying degrees of marrow fibrosis. Due to the increased extramedullary haematopoiesis, hiperuricemia may occur. However, TLS in patients with AMM is, according to the available literature, described just in one patient. In this paper we present a case of a 47-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fatigue and small amount of urine, and clinical signs of plethora and enlarged spleen. The laboratory findings showed leuko-and erythrocytosis, increased levels of urea-BUN (32 mmol/l) and creatinine (766 mmol/l) as well as uric acid (920 mmol/l).

There are limited data from the developing world. We contrast the incidence of cancer at ages 15-29 years in India and England. PROCEDURE: Malignant neoplasms in those aged 15-29 years registered during 2001-2003 in five urban population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) of India and in eight PBCRs in England were included. Site-based classification was used. Age-standardized incidence rates were expressed per 100,000 person years. RESULTS: In India, 4,864 (5.8%) of 84,450 cases and in England, 8,137 (1.2%) of 65,6752 cancer cases occurred in those aged 15-29 years. For this age group, the incidence rate for males and females in India were 12.91 and 14.19, and in England were 27.75 and 28.88, respectively. In males aged 15-29 years, the three most common cancers in India were leukemia, lymphoma, and central nervous system tumors and in England were cancers of male genital organs, lymphoma, and leukemia. Cancers of female genital organs, breast, and leukemia were most common in females in India and cancers of female genital organs, lymphoma, and melanoma in England. For cancers of mouth, stomach, and gall bladder, the incidence was higher in India. CONCLUSION: Incidence of cancer at ages 15-29 years in England is higher at most sites than in India. Variation in environmental exposures between the two countries might be an explanation. Under-ascertainment of cases and gender bias in seeking healthcare may also influence reported incidence rates in India.","['Arora, Ramandeep S', 'Alston, Robert D', 'Eden, Tim O B', 'Moran, Anthony', 'Geraci, Marco', ""O'Hara, Catherine"", 'Birch, Jillian M']","['Arora RS', 'Alston RD', 'Eden TO', 'Moran A', 'Geraci M', ""O'Hara C"", 'Birch JM']","['Cancer Research UK Paediatric and Familial Cancer Research Group, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. reemaraman@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/16 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22738 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jan;58(1):55-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22738.

However, some patients gradually develop resistance to imatinib, resulting in therapeutic failure. Metabonomic and genomic profiling of patients' responses to drug interventions can provide novel information about the in vivo metabolism of low-molecular-weight compounds and extend our insight into the mechanism of drug resistance. Based on a multi-platform of high-throughput metabonomics, SNP array analysis, karyotype and mutation, the metabolic phenotypes and genomic polymorphisms of CML patients and their diverse responses to imatinib were characterized. The untreated CML patients (UCML) showed different metabolic patterns from those of healthy controls, and the discriminatory metabolites suggested the perturbed metabolism of the urea cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid metabolism, and amino acid turnover in UCML. After imatinib treatment, patients sensitive to imatinib (SCML) and patients resistant to imatinib (RCML) had similar metabolic phenotypes to those of healthy controls and UCML, respectively. SCML showed a significant metabolic response to imatinib, with marked restoration of the perturbed metabolism. Most of the metabolites characterizing CML were adjusted to normal levels, including the intermediates of the urea cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In contrast, neither cytogenetic nor metabonomic analysis indicated any positive response to imatinib in RCML. We report for the first time the associated genetic and metabonomic responses of CML patients to imatinib and show that the perturbed in vivo metabolism of UCML is independent of imatinib treatment in resistant patients. Thus, metabonomics can potentially characterize patients' sensitivity or resistance to drug intervention.","['A, Jiye', 'Qian, Sixuan', 'Wang, Guangji', 'Yan, Bei', 'Zhang, Sujiang', 'Huang, Qing', 'Ni, Lingna', 'Zha, Weibin', 'Liu, Linsheng', 'Cao, Bei', 'Hong, Ming', 'Wu, Hanxin', 'Lu, Hua', 'Shi, Jian', 'Li, Mengjie', 'Li, Jianyong']","['A J', 'Qian S', 'Wang G', 'Yan B', 'Zhang S', 'Huang Q', 'Ni L', 'Zha W', 'Liu L', 'Cao B', 'Hong M', 'Wu H', 'Lu H', 'Shi J', 'Li M', 'Li J']","['Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0013186 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Oct 8;5(10):e13186. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0013186.,,PMC2951899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 171 Korean patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) without neoadjuvant therapy at a single center between February 2005 and May 2009. RP specimens obtained from these patients were analyzed for the expression of Bcl-2 using tissue microarray. The values of Bcl-2 and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with contingency table analysis, chi-square tests, and a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Bcl-2 expression was immunohistologically-confirmed in 42 patients (24.6%). Bcl-2 expression was not associated with conventional clinicopathologic factors. Bcl-2 negative patients had a significantly longer mean BCR-free survival than Bcl-2-positive patients (p=0.036). Among several variables, a high Gleason score in the RP specimen (>/=8), extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and Bcl-2 expression were significant predictors of BCR based on univariate analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that BCR was significantly associated with a high prostate specific antigen level (p=0.047), SVI (p<0.001), a positive surgical margin (p=0.004) and Bcl-2 expression (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 expression in RP specimens is associated with a significantly worse outcome, suggesting a potential clinical role for Bcl-2. Post-operative Bcl-2 could be a significant predictor of outcome after RP.","['Cho, In-Chang', 'Chung, Han Soo', 'Cho, Kang Su', 'Kim, Jeong Eun', 'Joung, Jae Young', 'Seo, Ho Kyung', 'Chung, Jinsoo', 'Park, Weon Seo', 'Hong, Eun Kyung', 'Lee, Kang Hyun']","['Cho IC', 'Chung HS', 'Cho KS', 'Kim JE', 'Joung JY', 'Seo HK', 'Chung J', 'Park WS', 'Hong EK', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Urology, Center for Prostate Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100930,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,2010/10/16 06:00,2010/10/16 06:01,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2010.42.3.157 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Sep;42(3):157-62. doi: 10.4143/crt.2010.42.3.157.

This study was carried out for the first time to investigate the potential role of UA in the differentiation of human leukemia HL60 cells and the underlying mechanisms in it. UA could induce differentiation of HL60 cells into the monocytic lineage, as assessed by the morphological change, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, and expression of CD14 and CD11b surface antigens. Moreover, UA activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in both dose-dependent and time-dependent manners. Inhibiting ERK pathway activation with PD98059 could significantly block the differentiation induced by UA. Consistent with the induced differentiation, the upregulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta by UA was also eliminated by PD98059. Taken together, the results reported here show that UA can promote the monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells and increase the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta by activating the ERK pathway, suggesting that UA could be a potential candidate as a differentiation-inducing agent for the therapeutic treatment of leukemia.","['Zhang, Ting', 'He, Yun-Mian', 'Wang, Jin-Song', 'Shen, Jing', 'Xing, Ying-Ying', 'Xi, Tao']","['Zhang T', 'He YM', 'Wang JS', 'Shen J', 'Xing YY', 'Xi T']","[""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Tong Jiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Triterpenes/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283409673 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2011 Feb;22(2):158-65. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283409673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated a fully automated, xylene-free nucleic acid extraction method for the simultaneous analysis of RNA and DNA biomarkers related to breast cancer. METHODS: We copurified both RNA and DNA from a single 10-mum section of 210 paired samples of FFPE tumor and adjacent normal tissues (1-25 years of archival time) using a fully automated extraction method. Half of the eluate was DNase I digested for mRNA expression analysis performed by using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR for the genes estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian) (ERBB2), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha 170kDa (TOP2A). The remaining undigested aliquot was used for the analysis of 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In 208 of 210 samples (99.0%) the protocol yielded robust quantification-cycle values for both RNA and DNA normalization. Expression of the 8 breast cancer genes was detected in 81%-100% of tumor tissues and 21%-100% of normal tissues. The 7 SNPs were successfully genotyped in 91%-97% of tumor and 94%-97% of normal tissues. Allele concordance between tumor and normal tissue was 98.9%-99.5%. CONCLUSIONS: This fully automated process allowed an efficient simultaneous extraction of both RNA and DNA from a single FFPE section and subsequent dual analysis of selected genes. High gene expression and genotyping detection rates demonstrate the feasibility of molecular profiling from limited archival patient samples.","['Hennig, Guido', 'Gehrmann, Mathias', 'Stropp, Udo', 'Brauch, Hiltrud', 'Fritz, Peter', 'Eichelbaum, Michel', 'Schwab, Matthias', 'Schroth, Werner']","['Hennig G', 'Gehrmann M', 'Stropp U', 'Brauch H', 'Fritz P', 'Eichelbaum M', 'Schwab M', 'Schroth W']","['Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products, Molecular Research Germany, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fixatives)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Automation, Laboratory', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Fixatives', 'Formaldehyde', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tissue Fixation']",2010/10/16 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2010.151233 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2010.151233 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2010 Dec;56(12):1845-53. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2010.151233.

Germline H2ax(-/-)p53(-/-) mice die of T-cell receptor-beta(-) (TCR-beta(-)) thymic lymphomas with translocations and other lesions characteristic of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that mice with inactivation of H2ax and p53 in thymocytes die at later ages to TCR-beta(-) or TCR-beta(+) thymic lymphomas containing a similar pattern of translocations as H2ax(-/-)p53(-/-) tumors. Germline Artemis(-/-) p53(-/-) mice die of lymphomas with antigen receptor locus translocations, whereas Artemis(-/-)H2ax(-/-)p53(-/-) mice die at earlier ages from multiple malignancies. We show here that Artemis(-/-) mice with p53 deletion in thymocytes die of TCR-beta(-) tumors containing Tcralpha/delta translocations, other clonal translocations, or aneuploidy, as well as Notch1 mutations. Strikingly, Artemis(-/-) mice with H2ax and p53 deletion in thymocytes exhibited a lower rate of mortality from TCR-beta(-) tumors, which harbored significantly elevated levels of genomic instability. Our data reveal that the cellular origin of H2ax and p53 loss impacts the rate of mortality from and developmental stage of thymic lymphomas, and suggest that conditional deletion of tumor suppressor genes may provide more physiologic models for human lymphoid malignancies than germline inactivation.","['Yin, Bu', 'Yang-Iott, Katherine S', 'Chao, Linda H', 'Bassing, Craig H']","['Yin B', 'Yang-Iott KS', 'Chao LH', 'Bassing CH']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Group, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (H2AX protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.-.- (Dclre1c protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Endonucleases', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genomic Instability', 'Histones/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', '*Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/metabolism', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60153-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-273045 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 6;117(1):175-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-273045.

We used physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to characterize the disposition of nutlin-3a in the mouse. Plasma protein binding and blood partitioning were assessed by in vitro studies. After intravenous (10 and 20 mg/kg) and oral (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) dosing, tissue concentrations of nutlin-3a were determined in plasma, liver, spleen, intestine, muscle, lung, adipose, bone marrow, adrenal gland, brain, retina, and vitreous fluid. The PBPK model was simultaneously fit to all pharmacokinetic data using NONMEM. Nutlin-3a exhibited nonlinear binding to murine plasma proteins, with the unbound fraction ranging from 0.7 to 11.8%. Nutlin-3a disposition was characterized by rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations at approximately 2 h and biphasic elimination consistent with a saturable clearance process. The final PBPK model successfully described the plasma and tissue disposition of nutlin-3a. Simulations suggested high bioavailability, rapid attainment of steady state, and little accumulation when administered once or twice daily at dosages up to 400 mg/kg. The final model was used to perform simulations of unbound tissue concentrations to determine which dosing regimens are appropriate for preclinical models of several pediatric malignancies.","['Zhang, Fan', 'Tagen, Michael', 'Throm, Stacy', 'Mallari, Jeremy', 'Miller, Laura', 'Guy, R Kiplin', 'Dyer, Michael A', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Roussel, Martine F', 'Nemeth, Katie', 'Zhu, Fangyi', 'Zhang, Jiakun', 'Lu, Min', 'Panetta, John C', 'Boulos, Nidal', 'Stewart, Clinton F']","['Zhang F', 'Tagen M', 'Throm S', 'Mallari J', 'Miller L', 'Guy RK', 'Dyer MA', 'Williams RT', 'Roussel MF', 'Nemeth K', 'Zhu F', 'Zhang J', 'Lu M', 'Panetta JC', 'Boulos N', 'Stewart CF']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tissue Distribution']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.110.035915 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.110.035915 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2011 Jan;39(1):15-21. doi: 10.1124/dmd.110.035915.

The exact mechanisms involved in this lesion have not yet been fully elucidated because of its heterogeneity and the imprecise knowledge of the implicated genes. This study was addressed to further contribute to the molecular definition of this lesion in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We applied single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array technology and gene expression profiling data to investigate the 13q14 deletion occurring in a panel of 100 untreated, early-stage (Binet A) patients representative of the major genetics, molecular, and biological features of the disease. RESULTS: Concordantly with FISH analysis, SNP arrays identified 44 patients with del(13)(q14) including 11 cases with a biallelic deletion. The shorter monoallelic deletion was 635-kb long. The loss of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster occurred in all del(13)(q14) cases except in 2 patients with a monoallelic deletion, who retained both copies. MiR-15a/16 expression was significantly downregulated only in patients with the biallelic loss of the miRNA cluster compared to 13q normal cases. Finally, the natural grouping of SNP profiles by nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm showed that patients could be classified into 2 separate clusters, mainly characterized by short/biallelic versus wide/monoallelic 13q14 deletions. Supervised analyses of expression data showed that specific transcriptional profiles are correlated with these 2 genomic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data highlight the presence of 2 distinct molecular types of 13q14 deletions, which may be of clinical relevance in CLL.","['Mosca, Laura', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Andronache, Adrian', 'Matis, Serena', 'Ferrari, Francesco', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Spriano, Mauro', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Festini, Gianluca', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Mosca L', 'Fabris S', 'Lionetti M', 'Todoerti K', 'Agnelli L', 'Morabito F', 'Cutrona G', 'Andronache A', 'Matis S', 'Ferrari F', 'Gentile M', 'Spriano M', 'Callea V', 'Festini G', 'Molica S', 'Deliliers GL', 'Bicciato S', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Milano, U.O.

Results of preclinical studies have shown that dexamethasone has a longer half-life and better CNS penetration than does prednisone. In prospective randomised trials, dexamethasone improved control of CNS leukaemia. At a prednisone-to-dexamethasone dose ratio of less than seven, dexamethasone (6-18 mg/m(2) per day) resulted in a better event-free survival than did prednisone (40-120 mg/m(2) per day), and high-dose dexamethasone (10-18 mg/m(2) per day) improved the outcome of T-cell ALL and high-risk ALL. However, dexamethasone caused more adverse effects, including infection, bone fracture, osteonecrosis, mood and behaviour problems, and myopathy. At a dose ratio greater than seven, the two drugs showed no difference in efficacy. Therefore, the efficacy of prednisone and dexamethasone is dose dependent and needs to be carefully assessed against the toxic effects. Moreover, although dexamethasone generally showed increased activity in ALL cells in vitro, the dose ratio of the two drugs that exerted equivalent cytotoxic effects differed substantially in samples from individuals. The selection of the type and dose of glucocorticoid should be based on the risk of relapse, treatment phase, and the chemotherapeutic drugs used concomitantly.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Inaba H', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20101012,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

METHODS: Parents of children with cancer receiving intensive chemotherapy for leukaemia/lymphoma or undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT) were asked to complete OMDQ daily for 21 d after chemotherapy. Other measures of mucositis obtained concurrently with OMDQ included the World Health Organization (WHO) Mucositis Scale, pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Esophageal Cancer Sub-scale (FACT-ECS). RESULTS: Parents of 59 children (median age = 5.62) provided complete OMDQ data for inclusion in analysis. The majority of children (73%) received SCT. Test-retest reliability of OMDQ exceeded the expected moderate reliability threshold established a priori and in particular, was good to excellent when mucositis was expected. In general, items of OMDQ that relate to pain, swallowing, drinking, eating and talking demonstrated moderate correlations with WHO, VAS and FACT-ECS indices with correlation coefficients >/= 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-report of a modified version of OMDQ is reliable and the questions relating to mouth and throat pain, as well as effect on function display construct validity for this population of children receiving intensive chemotherapy.","['Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Judd, Peter', 'Doyle, John', 'Gassas, Adam', 'Naqvi, Ahmed', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Tomlinson D', 'Ethier MC', 'Judd P', 'Doyle J', 'Gassas A', 'Naqvi A', 'Sung L']","['Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Hospital for Sick Children, 123 Edward Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1E2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20101012,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Deglutition Disorders/etiology', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Drinking', 'Eating', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Psychometrics', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Speech Disorders/chemically induced', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Stomatitis/*chemically induced', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)00883-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.09.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Feb;47(3):383-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.09.018.

The transmembrane regions of the ligand binding domains of the high-affinity IgE and low-affinity IgG receptors share an invariant motif (LFAVDTGL) containing a polar aspartate within a predominantly non-polar setting. The functional importance of this aspartate residue (D194) in FcvarepsilonRI-mediated receptor signaling was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) transfected with the human IgE binding subunit (FcvarepsilonRIalpha) incorporating polar substitutions like asparagine (D194N) or threonine (D194T) resulted in the formation of a functional rat/human chimeric receptor complex. When activated via huIgE and antigen, cells transfected with these variant receptor subunits supported mediator release, intracellular calcium mobilisation and tyrosine phosphorylation of gamma-chain and Syk kinase while a non-polar substitution (D194L) gave rise to cell surface expression of the mutated receptor subunit but failed to initiate downstream signaling. No cell surface expression of huFcvarepsilonRIalpha gene constructs was observed when D194 was replaced with the non-polar Ile (D194I) residue of similar size, the larger positively charged Arg (D194R) or lysine (D194K) residues, or the negatively charged glutamate (D194E) and smaller polar Ser (D194S) non-polar Ala (D194A) and V (D194V). These observations highlight importance of the size and charge of amino acid residue at position 194 in determining IgE receptor subunit interactions, cell surface localization, and initiation of downstream signaling events.","['Rashid, Amir', 'Iodice, Marco W', 'Carroll, Kathleen M', 'Housden, Jonathan E M', 'Hunter, Michael', 'Sabban, Sari', 'Artymiuk, Peter J', 'Helm, Birgit A']","['Rashid A', 'Iodice MW', 'Carroll KM', 'Housden JE', 'Hunter M', 'Sabban S', 'Artymiuk PJ', 'Helm BA']","['Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Firth Court, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, United Kingdom. dramiramc@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/*chemistry/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*chemistry/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Transfection']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(10)00563-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2010.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2010 Nov-Dec;48(1-3):128-36. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2010.09.002.

However, due to the associated secretory phenotype senescence can also contribute to cancer and possibly other age-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. There are two major mechanisms of cellular senescence; replicative senescence depends on telomere erosion or dysfunction whilst stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) is telomere-independent and also includes oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). The senescence phenotype is characterised by altered cellular morphology, increased activity for senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-GAL), increased formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs), permanent DNA damage, chromosomal instability and an inflammatory secretome. Some of these markers have been identified in cells from age-related pathologies. However, to improve our understanding of the contribution of cellular senescence to organismal ageing and age-related disease, it is imperative to define an unequivocal signature of cellular senescence that is functionally connected with normal and pathological ageing. Herein, we describe the processes leading to senescence, and the current biomarkers of cellular senescence, with particular emphasis on the causal role of DNA damage responses involved in the process. We highlight the gaps in our knowledge both of the processes leading to senescence, and the signature of cellular senescence both in vitro and in vivo. A well-defined set of senescence biomarkers for ageing and age-related disease would have a strong impact on the diagnosis, staging and predicted outcomes of age-related disease, providing the basis for a pharmacological intervention to postpone ageing and age-related disease.","['Sikora, Ewa', 'Arendt, Thomas', 'Bennett, Martin', 'Narita, Masashi']","['Sikora E', 'Arendt T', 'Bennett M', 'Narita M']","['Molecular Bases of Aging Laboratory, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland. e.sikora@nencki.gov.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20101012,England,Ageing Res Rev,Ageing research reviews,101128963,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Telomere/physiology']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1568-1637(10)00103-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arr.2010.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Ageing Res Rev. 2011 Jan;10(1):146-52. doi: 10.1016/j.arr.2010.10.002.

To enhance the conditioning regimen's antileukemic effect, we decided to supplant Flu with clofarabine (Clo), and assayed the interactions of these nucleoside analogs alone and in combination with Bu in Bu-resistant human cell lines in vitro. We found pronounced synergy between each nucleoside and the alkylator but even more enhanced cytotoxic synergy when the nucleoside analogs were combined prior to exposing the cells to Bu. We then designed a 4-arm clinical trial in patients with myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Patients were adaptively randomized as follows: Arm I-Clo:Flu 10:30 mg/m(2), Arm II-20:20 mg/m(2), Arm III-30:10 mg/m(2), and Arm IV-single-agent Clo at 40 mg/m(2). The nucleoside analog(s) were/was infused over 1 hour once daily for 4 days, followed on each day by Bu, infused over 3 hours to a pharmacokinetically targeted daily area under the curve (AUC) of 6000 muMol-min +/- 10%. Fifty-one patients have been enrolled with a minimum follow-up exceeding 100 days. There were 32 males and 19 females, with a median age of 45 years (range: 6-59). Nine patients had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (BC: 2, second AP: 3, and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor refractory first chronic phase [CP]: 4). Forty-two patients had AML: 14 were induction failures, 8 in first chemotherapy-refractory relapse, 7 in untreated relapse, 3 in second or subsequent relapse, 4 were in second complete remission (CR), and 3 in second CR without platelet recovery (CRp), 2 were in high-risk CR1. Finally, 1 patient was in first CRp. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was tacrolimus and mini-methorexate (MTX), and those who had an unrelated or 1 antigen-mismatched donor received low-dose rabbit-ATG (Thymoglobulin). All patients engrafted. Forty-one patients had active leukemia at the time of transplant, and 35 achieved CR (85%). Twenty of the 42 AML patients and 5 of 9 CML patients are alive with a projected median overall survival (OS) of 23 months. Marrow and blood (T cell) chimerism studies at day +100 revealed that both in the lower-dose Clo groups (groups 1+2) and the higher-dose Clo groups (groups 3+4), the patients had a median of 100% donor (T cell)-derived DNA. There has been no secondary graft failure. In the first 100 days, 1 patient died of pneumonia, and 1 of liver GVHD. We conclude that (1) Clo +/- Flu with i.v. Bu as pretransplant conditioning is safe in high-risk myeloid leukemia patients; (2) clofarabine is sufficiently immunosuppressive to support allo-SCT in myeloid leukemia; and (3) the median OS of 23 months in this high-risk patient population is encouraging. Additional studies to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy of Clo +/- Flu with i.v. Bu as pretransplant conditioning therapy are warranted.","['Andersson, Borje S', 'Valdez, Benigno C', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Worth, Laura L', 'Popat, Uday', 'Madden, Timothy', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Jones, Roy B', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Andersson BS', 'Valdez BC', 'de Lima M', 'Wang X', 'Thall PF', 'Worth LL', 'Popat U', 'Madden T', 'Hosing C', 'Alousi A', 'Rondon G', 'Kebriaei P', 'Shpall EJ', 'Jones RB', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. bandersson@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101011,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Rabbits', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tacrolimus', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00434-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jun;17(6):893-900. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.022.

That notwithstanding, the post-BMT milieu, characterized by marked cytopenia, can pose a challenge to the implementation of vaccine immunotherapies. To bypass this problem, partial post-BMT immune reconstitution has been allowed to develop prior to vaccination. However, delaying vaccination can also potentially allow the expansion of residual tumor cells. Other approaches have used reinfusion of ""primed"" autologous lymphocytes and multiple administrations of GM tumor cells, which required the processing of large amounts of tumor. Utilizing the MMB3.19 murine myeloid leukemia model, we tested whether a single dose of GM tumor cells, 7 days prior to syngeneic BMT, could be a curative treatment in MMB3.19-challenged recipient mice. This vaccination protocol significantly improved survival of mice by eliciting long-lasting host immune responses that survived lethal irradiation, and were even protective against post-BMT tumor rechallenge. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mature donor lymphocytes can also play a limited role in mounting the antitumor response, but our pre-BMT vaccination strategy obviated the need for either established de novo immune reconstitution or the use of multiple post-BMT immunizations.","['Zilberberg, Jenny', 'Friedman, Thea M', 'Dranoff, Glenn', 'Korngold, Robert']","['Zilberberg J', 'Friedman TM', 'Dranoff G', 'Korngold R']","['The John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601, USA. jzilberberg@humed.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101012,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Adaptive Immunity/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/radiation effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology/radiation effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Immunity, Cellular/radiation effects', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2010/10/16 06:00,2011/06/04 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00432-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Mar;17(3):330-40. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.020.

The histological types of CLD: B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma--in 28/41 (68.29%) patients, T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma--2/41 (4.87%) patients, Hodgkin's lymphoma--2/41 (4.87%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia--7/41 (17.07%), Waldenstrom disease--2/41 (4.87%) patients. Regarding the type of CLD, 19/41 (46.34%) of the patients have an aggressive type of CLD and 22/41 (53.65%) a non-aggressive type of CLD. The hepatitis viral infection distribution in our patients: 14/41 (34.14%) have HBV infection, 24/41 (58.53%) have HCV infection, double/triple association of viral infection was found in 3/41 (7.31%) patients. Within HBV infection subgroup 9/14 (64.28%) patients have an aggressive type of CLD and 5/14 (35,71%) patients have a non-aggressive type, whereas within the group with HCV infection we found a different distribution: 9/24 (37,5%) patients with aggressive type and 15/24 (62.5%) with non-aggressive type of CLD. The clinical parameters monitored were: B signs were present in 19/41 (43.34%) patients, the superficial or profound adenopathies--were found in 29/41 (70,73%) patients, hepatomegaly--in 38/41 (92,68%) patients, splenomegaly--in 21/41 (51.21%) patients, extra-nodal involvements in 10/41 (24,39%) patients and most frequent in the non-aggressive type of CLD--6/10 (60%) patients. The hematological and biochemical parameters were: the presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia--found in a small number of patients; lymphocytosis--positive in 33/41 (80.48%) patients, most with HCV infection and non-aggressive type of disease, the presence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia--in 4/41 (9.75%) patients, cryoglobulins--8/41 (19.51%) patients, all with HCV infection; also the liver function was monitored. Antiviral therapy was administered to 12/41 (29.26%) patients--Lamivudine to 8/41 (19.51%) patients and Ribavirine/Interferon to 4/41 (9.75%) patients. Chemotherapy was given in 32/41 (78%) patients. Monoclonal antibodies anti CD20 (Rituximab) therapy was associated in 6/41 (14.63%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence in female sex of over 50 years old was noticed. A strong association between B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and hepatitis viral infection B, C, D was revealed, the most frequent being the C hepatitis virus, associated with the non-aggressive type of CLD, extra-nodal involvement, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, cryoglobulins, cytolysis and colestasis. The clinical and biological disease history will be monitored during chemotherapy and antiviral treatment.","['Vladareanu, Ana-Maria', 'Ciufu, Cristina', 'Neagu, Ana-Maria', 'Onisai, Minodora', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Vintilescu, Ana-Maria', 'Dobrea, Camelia', 'Arama, Victoria', 'Mihailescu, Raluca', 'Arama, Sorin']","['Vladareanu AM', 'Ciufu C', 'Neagu AM', 'Onisai M', 'Bumbea H', 'Vintilescu AM', 'Dobrea C', 'Arama V', 'Mihailescu R', 'Arama S']","['Department of Hematology, Emergency Universitary Hospital, 169 Splaiul Independentei Street, Bucharest 050098, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Romania,J Med Life,Journal of medicine and life,101477617,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/complications', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/complications', 'Hepatitis D, Chronic/complications', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/*complications', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Romania']",2010/10/16 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/16 06:00'],"['2010/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Life. 2010 Jul-Sep;3(3):320-9.,,PMC3019001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known of the gene repertoire that is directly affected by CUX1 in the intestinal epithelial context. This article identifies the Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger (PLZF) gene as a transcriptional target for the CUX1 repressor. CUX1 interacts in vivo with multiple DNA-binding sites in the 5'-UTR and promoter of the PLZF gene in colorectal cancer cells, a region that is functionally targeted by CUX1 in cotransfection assays. PLZF was found to be induced in colorectal cancer cell lines, correlating with a low detectable level of CUX1, a pattern that was reversed in normal human colonocytes. Reduction of p200CUX1 expression by RNAi in the Caco-2/15 cell line increased PLZF gene transcript expression. Because of the implication of Plzf in the regulation of stem cell maintenance, as well as Wnt and Ras signaling, in other systems, our observations suggest that the novel genetic relationship between CUX1 and PLZF could be of relevance to human diseases, such as leukemia, and open up a new field of investigation for the implication of these regulators during intestinal polyposis and cancer.","['Frechette, Isabelle', 'Darsigny, Mathieu', 'Brochu-Gaudreau, Karine', 'Jones, Christine', 'Boudreau, Francois']","['Frechette I', 'Darsigny M', 'Brochu-Gaudreau K', 'Jones C', 'Boudreau F']","[""Departement d'Anatomie et Biologie Cellulaire, Faculte de Medecine et des Sciences de la Sante, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2010/10/15 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07813.x [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2010 Oct;277(20):4241-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07813.x.,['MOP-89770/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we first reported that ATRA-induced myeloid leukemia differentiation was accompanied with the increased level of ubiquitin-protein conjugates and the upregulation of proteasome activity. To explore the functional role of the activated proteasome in retinoic acid (RA) signaling, the effects of proteasome inhibitors on RA-induced cell differentiation were determined. Our results demonstrated that inhibition of ATRA-elevated proteasome activity obviously promoted the myeloid maturation program triggered by ATRA, suggesting that the overactivated proteasome is not beneficial for ATRA's effects. Further studies demonstrated that the synergistic differentiating effects of ATRA and proteasome inhibitors might be associated with the protection of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) from degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). Moreover, the accumulated RARalpha was able to enhance the transcription of its target gene, which might also contribute to the enhanced differentiation of leukemia cells. Together, by linking the UPP to ATRA-dependent signaling, our data provide a novel insight into studying the mechanisms of ATRA-elicited cellular effects and imply the possibility of combination of ATRA and proteasome inhibitors in leukemia therapy.","['Fang, Yanfen', 'Zhou, Xinglu', 'Lin, Meihua', 'Ying, Meidan', 'Luo, Peihua', 'Zhu, Difeng', 'Lou, Jianshu', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Fang Y', 'Zhou X', 'Lin M', 'Ying M', 'Luo P', 'Zhu D', 'Lou J', 'Yang B', 'He Q']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20687 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2011 Jan;50(1):24-35. doi: 10.1002/mc.20687.,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the product of protooncogene Cot1 represses the monocytic phenotype in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells induced to differentiate by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D), even though the expression of cellular Cot1 increases early in the process of 1,25D-induced differentiation. Interestingly, the expression of the two members of the Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) family of molecular scaffolds, known to be positive regulators of Ras signaling and of 1,25D-induced differentiation, increases in parallel with Cot1 in 1,25D-treated cells. However, KSR1/2 are negatively regulated by Cot1, as determined by transfection of siCot1, and confirmed by a reverse effect of ectopic expression of Cot1. The effect of Cot1 in AML cells appears to be cell-type specific, as previous reports in other cell types found KSR-2 to be a negative regulator of Cot1, a reverse relationship. Also in contrast to findings in other cells, in AML cells Cot1 exerts negative control on the MAP kinase pathways, since siCot1 increases the levels of activated Raf1, p90RSK, JNK1, c-jun, and p38, though not of MEK/ERK. These findings have implications for therapy of AML, since in AML cells active MAPKs hasten cell differentiation, and specific pharmacological inhibitors of Cot1 kinase activity have recently became available, thus making Cot1 a ""druggable"" target.","['Wang, Xuening', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07101-1709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (KSR-1 protein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (KSR2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K8 protein, human)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22449 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 May;226(5):1232-40. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22449.,"['R01-CA-117942-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-44722-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3440184,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,['NIHMS254193'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanisms by which Sox2 contributes to self-renewal or reprogramming processes remain to be determined. Here, we provide new evidence for a phosphorylation-based regulation of Sox2 activity. Akt directly interacts with Sox2 and promotes its stabilization through phosphorylation at Thr118, which enhances the transcriptional activity of Sox2 in ESCs. Moreover, phosphorylation of Sox2 cooperates in the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts by enabling more efficient induction of iPSCs. Overall, our studies provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of Sox2 in ESCs and also provide a direct link between phosphorylation events and somatic cell reprogramming.","['Jeong, Chul-Ho', 'Cho, Yong-Yeon', 'Kim, Myoung-Ok', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Cho, Eun-Jin', 'Lee, Sung-Young', 'Jeon, Young-Jin', 'Lee, Kun Yeong', 'Yao, Ke', 'Keum, Young-Sam', 'Bode, Ann M', 'Dong, Zigang']","['Jeong CH', 'Cho YY', 'Kim MO', 'Kim SH', 'Cho EJ', 'Lee SY', 'Jeon YJ', 'Lee KY', 'Yao K', 'Keum YS', 'Bode AM', 'Dong Z']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cellular Reprogramming/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.540 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2010 Dec;28(12):2141-50. doi: 10.1002/stem.540.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Stem Cells. 2012 Sep;30(9):2064'],,,,,,,,

The hallmark of CML is an acquired chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which results in the synthesis of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) fusion oncoprotein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The introduction of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is specific for BCR-ABL, was a major breakthrough in CML therapy. Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience loss of response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation because of toxicity (intolerance). For patients with CML, failure on standard-dose imatinib therapy (400 mg daily), imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients who experience drug toxicity, and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacologic profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutation status. To optimize therapeutic benefit, clinicians should select treatment based on each patient's historic response, adverse-event tolerance, and risk factors.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The reverse orientation of the expression cassette of the transgene was found to give higher transducing titer and higher-level gene expression. The deletion analysis revealed that the 54-bp-long sequence of U3 (34 and 20 bp present at 5' and 3' extreme ends, respectively) was sufficient for the functions of retroviral vectors.

Whereas inhibitors targeting a large number of receptor and intracellular tyrosine kinases including c-KIT, FLT3, BTK and SYK were comparatively inactive, the CDK inhibitors BMS-387032 and flavopiridol showed marked efficacy similar to staurosporine. Using the kinobeads proteomics method, kinase expression profiles and binding profiles of the inhibitors to target protein complexes were quantitatively monitored in CLL cells. The targets most potently affected were CDK9, cyclin T1, AFF3/4 and MLLT1, which may represent four subunits of a deregulated positive transcriptional elongation factor (p-TEFb) complex. Albeit with lower potency, both drugs also bound the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH containing CDK7. Staurosporine and geldanamycin do not affect these targets and thus seem to exhibit a different mechanism of action. The data support a critical role of p-TEFb inhibitors in CLL that supports their future clinical development.","['Kruse, U', 'Pallasch, C P', 'Bantscheff, M', 'Eberhard, D', 'Frenzel, L', 'Ghidelli, S', 'Maier, S K', 'Werner, T', 'Wendtner, C M', 'Drewes, G']","['Kruse U', 'Pallasch CP', 'Bantscheff M', 'Eberhard D', 'Frenzel L', 'Ghidelli S', 'Maier SK', 'Werner T', 'Wendtner CM', 'Drewes G']","['Cellzome AG, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0', '(N-(5-(((5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-oxazolyl)methyl)thio)-2-thiazolyl)-4-piperidinec', 'arboxamide)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxazoles/therapeutic use', 'Piperidines/therapeutic use', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Proteomics', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010233 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.233 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jan;25(1):89-100. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.233.

We report on 28 patients after HHCT with CD3/CD19-depleted grafts using RIC, which were prospectively evaluated for engraftment and immune reconstitution. Engraftment was rapid with full chimerism reached on day +15 after HHCT. T-cell reconstitution was delayed with a median of 205 CD3+ cells/mul, 70 CD3+CD4+ cells/mul and 66 CD3+ CD8+ cells/mul on day +100, respectively. A skewed T-cell receptor-Vbeta repertoire with oligoclonal T-cell expansions to day +100 and normalization after day +200 was observed. B-cell reconstitution was slow with a median of 100 CD19+ CD20+ cells/mul on day +150. Natural killer (NK) cell engraftment was fast reaching normal values on day +20. An increased natural cytotoxicity receptor and NKG2A, but decreased NKG2D and KIR expressions were observed on NK cells until day +100.

However, the overall effect of imatinib on the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is undetermined. Between 2002 and 2005, 100 newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph+ALL were registered to a phase II study of imatinib-combined chemotherapy (Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group Ph+ALL202 study) and 97 patients achieved CR. We compared clinical outcomes of 51 patients who received allo-HSCT in their first CR (imatinib cohort) with those of 122 historical control patients in the pre-imatinib era (pre-imatinib cohort). The probability of overall survival at 3 years after allo-HSCT was 65% (95% confidence interval (CI), 49-78%) for the imatinib cohort and 44% (95% CI, 35-52%) for the pre-imatinib cohort. Multivariate analysis confirmed that this difference was statistically significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.44, P=0.005). Favorable outcomes of the imatinib cohort were also observed for disease-free survival (P=0.007) and relapse (P=0.002), but not for non-relapse mortality (P=0.265).

Because of the particularly poor prognosis of relapses, it is vital to identify molecular risk factors allowing early and effective treatment stratification. Activating NOTCH1 mutations signify a favorable prognosis in patients treated on ALL-BFM protocols. We have now tested if NOTCH pathway activation at different steps has similar clinical effects and if multiple mutations in this pathway function synergistically. Analysis of a validation set of 151 T-ALL patients and of the total cohort of 301 patients confirms the low relapse rate generally and the overall favorable effect of activating NOTCH1 mutations. Subgroup analysis shows that the NOTCH1 effect in ALL-BFM is restricted to patients with rapid early treatment response. Inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 is associated with rapid early treatment response and synergizes with NOTCH1 receptor activation. However, the effect of FBXW7 inactivation is separable from NOTCH1 activation by not synergizing with NOTCH1 mutations in predicting favorable long-term outcome, which can probably be explained by the interaction of FBXW7 with other clients. Finally, the comparison with other European protocols suggests that the NOTCH effect is treatment dependent generally and may depend on the intensity of central nervous system-directed therapy specifically.","['Kox, C', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Stanulla, M', 'Leible, S', 'Schrappe, M', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Koehler, R', 'Tolle, G', 'Bandapalli, O R', 'Breit, S', 'Muckenthaler, M U', 'Kulozik, A E']","['Kox C', 'Zimmermann M', 'Stanulla M', 'Leible S', 'Schrappe M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Koehler R', 'Tolle G', 'Bandapalli OR', 'Breit S', 'Muckenthaler MU', 'Kulozik AE']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, Angelika Lautenschlager Children's Hospital, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Child', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/physiology']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010203 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.203 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Dec;24(12):2005-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.203.

Indeed, specific immune response gene signatures, obtained from whole biopsy samples, have been associated with patient survival. In this study, we performed gene expression profiling of purified B cell and non-B cell compartments obtained from FL and reactive lymph nodes. We identified 677 non-redundant genes defining the FL interface and involving 26 FL-specific functional networks. This approach highlighted an interleukin-4 (IL-4)-centered pathway associated with an activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), which favors overexpression of IL-4-target genes. In addition, FL microenvironment was characterized by a strong enrichment in follicular helper T cells (T(FH)), as demonstrated through transcriptomic and flow cytometry analyses. The majority of phospho-STAT6(pos) B cells were located at the vicinity of cells expressing the programmed death 1 (PD-1) T(FH) marker. Moreover, purified FL-derived T(FH), expressed IL4 at very high levels compared with purified tonsil-derived T(FH) or non-T(FH) microenvironment. Altogether, our study demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating T(FH) specifically express functional IL-4 in FL, creating an IL-4-dependent T(FH)-B cell axis.

RAS signals to the RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR (AKT) signaling pathways, which have a major role in melanoma progression. RHEB positively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We investigated the effects of the FTI lonafarnib alone and in combination with MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) or AKT (acutely transforming retrovirus AKT8 in rodent T-cell lymphoma) pathway inhibitors on proliferation, survival, and invasive tumor growth of melanoma cells. Lonafarnib alone did not sufficiently inhibit melanoma cell growth. Combinations of lonafarnib with AKT pathway inhibitors did not significantly increase melanoma cell growth inhibition. In contrast, combinations of lonafarnib with MAPK pathway inhibitors yielded additional growth-inhibiting effects. In particular, the combination of the FTI lonafarnib with the pan-RAF inhibitor sorafenib synergistically inhibited melanoma cell growth, significantly enhanced sorafenib-induced apoptosis, and completely suppressed invasive tumor growth in monolayer and organotypic cultures, respectively. Apoptosis induction was associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related transcription factors p8 and CHOP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein), and downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) family protein Mcl-1(myeloid cell leukemia 1). Lonafarnib did not affect MAPK and AKT but did affect mTOR signaling. Together, these findings suggest that the FTI lonafarnib inhibits mTOR signaling and enforces sorafenib-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells and may therefore represent an effective alternative for melanoma treatment.","['Niessner, Heike', 'Beck, Daniela', 'Sinnberg, Tobias', 'Lasithiotakis, Konstantinos', 'Maczey, Evelyn', 'Gogel, Jeannette', 'Venturelli, Sascha', 'Berger, Alexander', 'Mauthe, Mario', 'Toulany, Mahmoud', 'Flaherty, Keith', 'Schaller, Martin', 'Schadendorf, Dirk', 'Proikas-Cezanne, Tassula', 'Schittek, Birgit', 'Garbe, Claus', 'Kulms, Dagmar', 'Meier, Friedegund']","['Niessner H', 'Beck D', 'Sinnberg T', 'Lasithiotakis K', 'Maczey E', 'Gogel J', 'Venturelli S', 'Berger A', 'Mauthe M', 'Toulany M', 'Flaherty K', 'Schaller M', 'Schadendorf D', 'Proikas-Cezanne T', 'Schittek B', 'Garbe C', 'Kulms D', 'Meier F']","['Division of Dermatologic Oncology, Department of Dermatology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101014,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NUPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/physiology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Sorafenib', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)35153-8 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2010.297 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2011 Feb;131(2):468-79. doi: 10.1038/jid.2010.297.

In all patients, the disease was confirmed at the molecular level and all had received the GIMEMA/AIDA protocol, achieving molecular remission at the end of consolidation. Relapse was hematological in 12 cases and molecular in one. After consolidation with chemotherapy, all patients achieved MR and received a further course plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor as mobilizing therapy. A median of 7.6x10(6) (range 2.7-10) CD34-positive cells/kg were collected. In all cases, molecular evaluation of the apheresis product was negative for the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha gene. No case of transplant-related mortality was recorded. No maintenance or consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) was given to any patient. After a median follow-up of 25 months from ASCT, 10 patients are alive in sustained MR, while two relapsed after ASCT and died in the setting of refractory disease; one patient achieved a third CR and is waiting for allogeneic SCT. These results suggest that ASCT performed with a molecularly negative graft in APL patients in second MR offers a valid chance for achieving a cure.

In this preclinical animal test, primarily cultured cells from the tumor sites and normal sites of a two-drug (200 mug/ml 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) plus 500 mug/ml arecoline)-induced oral cancer C57BL/6J Narl mice model were examined for their viabilities after treatments of arsenic trioxide with/without other drugs. In this model, the mice were treated with 4NQO plus arecoline (NA) in their drinking water for eight weeks (8-w), and the drugs were withdrawn for another 10 or 20 weeks (18-w and 28-w, respectively). The results showed that 2 muM of arsenic trioxide 24-h treatment suppressed the viabilities of cells primarily cultured from the tumor sites of 8-w, 18-w and 28-w NA-treated mice to 72.9%, 71.5% and 65.6%.

DH-PMF induced G(2)/M and subG(1) cell cycle arrest, increased the levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1), and reduced the expression of cyclin D1, CDC2, and c-MYC. Furthermore, DH-PMF inhibited AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) activation, reduced cell survival proteins, and induced apoptosis, as indicated by annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3. Overall, our results demonstrate that DH-PMF induces suppression of cell proliferation through modulation of AKT-GSK3beta pathways and induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors.","['Phromnoi, Kanokkarn', 'Reuter, Simone', 'Sung, Bokyung', 'Limtrakul, Pornngarm', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Phromnoi K', 'Reuter S', 'Sung B', 'Limtrakul P', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 143, Houston, TX 77030, USA. aggarwal@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"[""0 (5,3'-dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gardenia/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Medicine, East Asian Traditional', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thailand']",2010/10/15 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['30/9/3599 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Sep;30(9):3599-610.,"['P01 CA124787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3142747,,,,,,['NIHMS307526'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight compounds were evaluated for selective cytotoxicity using HT-29, HeLa, and HL-60 cells, and in a NF-kappaB assay. Active compounds were then tested using ROS and mitochondria transmembrane potential (MTP) assays. NF-kappaB and nuclear factor activated T-cell (NFAT) translocation were also assessed using their respective whole cell assays. RESULTS: Bruceajavanone B, bruceantin, bruceine A, (-)-hydnocarpin, and chrysoeriol exhibited cytotoxic potential and NF-kappaB p65 inhibition. Chrysoeriol exhibited selective cytotoxicity against leukemia cells with greater potency and also showed an ability to up-regulate NFAT transcriptional pathways through the amplification of intracellular ROS, in the presence of H2O2, to a greater degree than bruceantin and bruceine. CONCLUSION: Chrysoeriol selectively kills leukemic cells and potentiates the amplification of ROS levels. Therefore, chrysoeriol could serve as a potential chemotherapeutic modifier for leukemia chemotherapy since leukemia cells have a higher susceptibility to elevated ROS levels.","['Kim, Jeong-Ah', 'Lau, Edward K', 'Pan, Li', 'De Blanco, Esperanza J Carcache']","['Kim JA', 'Lau EK', 'Pan L', 'De Blanco EJ']","['Division of Pharmacy Practice and Administration, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Flavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Flavonolignans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Quassins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '161043-67-0 (bruceajavanin B)', '25514-31-2 (bruceine A)', '51419-48-8 (hydnocarpin)', 'Q813145M20 (chrysoeriol)', 'S3NW88DI4T (bruceantin)']",IM,"['Brucea/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flavones', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flavonolignans/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Quassins/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']",2010/10/15 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['30/9/3295 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Sep;30(9):3295-300.,"['P01 CA125066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA125066-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA125066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3013507,,,,,,['NIHMS252560'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that methylation patterns in these cell types are capable of distinguishing nonmalignant from malignant cells and the main reason for this difference is hypomethylation of the genome at the transition from MGUS to presentation myeloma. In addition, gene-specific hypermethylation was evident at the myeloma stage. Differential methylation was also evident at the transition from myeloma to plasma cell leukemia with remethylation of the genome, particularly of genes involved in cell-cell signaling and cell adhesion, which may contribute to independence from the bone marrow microenvironment. There was a high degree of methylation variability within presentation myeloma samples, which was associated with cytogenetic differences between samples. More specifically, we found methylation subgroups were defined by translocations and hyperdiploidy, with t(4;14) myeloma having the greatest impact on DNA methylation. Two groups of hyperdiploid samples were identified, on the basis of unsupervised clustering, which had an impact on overall survival.

Type I IFN has a direct antiviral activity mediated by antiviral enzymes, but it also modulates the function of cells of the adaptive immune system. Many viruses can suppress type I IFN production, and in retroviral infections, the initial type I IFN is weak. Thus, one strategy of immunotherapy in viral infection is the exogenous induction of type I IFN during acute viral infection by TLR ligands. Along these lines, the TLR3/MDA5 ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] has already been used to treat viral infections. However, the immunological mechanisms underlying this successful therapy have not been defined until now. In this study, the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model was used to investigate the mode of action of poly(I:C) in antiretroviral immunotherapy. Postexposure, poly(I:C) treatment of FV-infected mice resulted in a significant reduction in viral loads and protection from virus-induced leukemia. This effect was IFN dependent because type I IFN receptor-deficient mice could not be protected by poly(I:C). The poly(I:C)-induced IFN response resulted in the expression of antiviral enzymes, which suppressed FV replication. Also, the virus-specific T cell response was augmented. Interestingly, it did not enhance the number of virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, but rather the functional properties of these cells, such as cytokine production and cytotoxic activity. The results demonstrate a direct antiviral and immunomodulatory effect of poly(I:C) and, therefore, suggests its potential for clinical treatment of retroviral infections.","['Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Dietze, Kirsten K', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Lang, Karl S', 'Barchet, Winfried', 'Kirschning, Carsten J', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Gibbert K', 'Dietze KK', 'Zelinskyy G', 'Lang KS', 'Barchet W', 'Kirschning CJ', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University Clinics in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101013,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon Type I/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Poly I-C/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Viral Load/drug effects']",2010/10/15 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000858 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000858 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Nov 15;185(10):6179-89. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000858.

This resistance to exogenous infection is due to a nonpermissive variant of the XPR1 gammaretrovirus receptor, a resistance that also limits in vivo expression of germ line X-MLV proviruses capable of producing infectious virus. Because laboratory mice vary widely in their proviral contents and in their virus expression patterns, we screened inbred strains for sequence and functional variants of the XPR1 receptor. We also typed inbred strains and wild mouse species for an endogenous provirus, Bxv1, that is capable of producing infectious X-MLV and that also contributes to the generation of pathogenic recombinant MLVs. We identified the active Bxv1 provirus in many common inbred strains and in some Japanese Mus molossinus mice but in none of the other wild mouse species that carry X-MLVs. Our screening for Xpr1 variants identified the permissive Xpr1(sxv) allele in 7 strains of laboratory mice, including a Bxv1-positive strain, F/St, which is characterized by lifelong X-MLV viremia. Cells from three strains carrying Xpr1(sxv), namely, SWR, SJL, and SIM.R, were shown to be infectable by X-MLV and XMRV; these strains carry different alleles at Fv1 and vary in their sensitivities to specific X/P-MLV isolates and XMRV. Several strains with Xpr1(sxv) lack the active Bxv1 provirus or other endogenous X-MLVs and may provide a useful model system to evaluate the in vivo spread of these gammaretroviruses and their disease potential in their natural host.","['Baliji, Surendranath', 'Liu, Qingping', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Baliji S', 'Liu Q', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20101013,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gammaretrovirus/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics/*virology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics', 'Viremia/*genetics', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01863-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01863-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Dec;84(24):12841-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01863-10.

Arsenic is an effective treatment for this disease as it induces SUMO-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the PML-RAR fusion protein. Here we analyze the nuclear trafficking dynamics of PML and its SUMO-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase, RNF4 in response to arsenic. After administration of arsenic, PML immediately transits into nuclear bodies where it undergoes SUMO modification. This initial recruitment of PML into nuclear bodies is not dependent on RNF4, but RNF4 quickly follows PML into the nuclear bodies where it is responsible for ubiquitylation of SUMO-modified PML and its degradation by the proteasome. While arsenic restricts the mobility of PML, FRAP analysis indicates that RNF4 continues to rapidly shuttle into PML nuclear bodies in a SUMO-dependent manner. Under these conditions FRET studies indicate that RNF4 interacts with SUMO in PML bodies but not directly with PML. These studies indicate that arsenic induces the rapid reorganization of the cell nucleus by SUMO modification of nuclear body-associated PML and uptake of the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 leading to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PML.","['Geoffroy, Marie-Claude', 'Jaffray, Ellis G', 'Walker, Katherine J', 'Hay, Ronald T']","['Geoffroy MC', 'Jaffray EG', 'Walker KJ', 'Hay RT']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee DD15EH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101013,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Arsenic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['E10-05-0449 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E10-05-0449 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2010 Dec;21(23):4227-39. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E10-05-0449.

Forty of the 48 patients hospitalized for ALL were given a low-dose Synacthen test (1 mug), a mean 7 days after the induction phase. An adrenal deficit was diagnosed in 27 patients (67.5%). No significant clinical or hematological difference was identified between the ""with deficit"" (n = 27) and ""without deficit"" (n = 13) groups. The diagnosis of adrenal deficit was not more common for children who had received dexamethasone (13/19) or prednisone (14/21), or for those who had (19/29) or had not (8/11) experienced corticoid toxicity during induction. The clinical signs suggesting adrenal deficit were identical in the two groups and none of the children presented an acute episode. In biological terms, only hypoprotidemia was significantly more common in patients with adrenal deficit (p = 0.0004). Of 13 patients with a deficit at the end of the induction who had received a 2nd low-dose Synacthene((R)) test before intensification no. 1, 3 weeks on average after the end of corticotherapy, only two still had a deficit. Thus, corticoid-induced adrenal deficit is a common complication in children treated for ALL, although it is not highly symptomatic. Most of these children recover normal adrenal function before intensification no. 1, but it does not eliminate the risk of a secondary deficit after other courses of corticotherapy. Systematic repeated Synacthene((R)) tests in common practice among children treated for ALL does not seem justified.

However, the TF-gene interaction varies in different environmental conditions and tissues, but such information is rarely available and cannot be predicted simply by motif analysis. Thus, it is beneficial to identify key TF-gene interactions under the experimental condition based on transcriptome data. Such information would be useful in identifying key regulatory pathways and gene markers of TFs in further studies. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm to trim network connectivity such that the important regulatory interactions between the TFs and the genes were retained and the regulatory signals were deduced. Theoretical studies demonstrated that the regulatory signals were accurately reconstructed even in the case where only three independent transcriptome datasets were available. At least 80% of the main target genes were correctly predicted in the extreme condition of high noise level and small number of datasets. Our algorithm was tested with transcriptome data taken from mice under rapamycin treatment. The initial network topology from the literature contains 70 TFs, 778 genes, and 1423 edges between the TFs and genes. Our method retained 1074 edges (i.e. 75% of the original edge number) and identified 17 TFs as being significantly perturbed under the experimental condition. Twelve of these TFs are involved in MAPK signaling or myeloid leukemia pathways defined in the KEGG database, or are known to physically interact with each other. Additionally, four of these TFs, which are Hif1a, Cebpb, Nfkb1, and Atf1, are known targets of rapamycin. Furthermore, the trimmed network was able to predict Eno1 as an important target of Hif1a; this key interaction could not be detected without trimming the regulatory network. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of our new algorithm, relative to the original NCA, is that our algorithm can identify the important TF-gene interactions. Identifying the important TF-gene interactions is crucial for understanding the roles of pleiotropic global regulators, such as p53. Also, our algorithm has been developed to overcome NCA's inability to analyze large networks where multiple TFs regulate a single gene. Thus, our algorithm extends the applicability of NCA to the realm of mammalian regulatory network analysis.","['Tran, Linh M', 'Hyduke, Daniel R', 'Liao, James C']","['Tran LM', 'Hyduke DR', 'Liao JC']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1592, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101013,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-511 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-511 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Oct 13;11:511. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-511.,['GM076143/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2967563,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of ZAP-70 in B-CLL is a surrogate marker for IgV(H) unmutated (UM). As determination of IgV(H) mutational status involves a methodology currently unavailable for most clinical laboratories, it is important to have available a reliable technique for ZAP-70 estimation in B-CLL. Flow cytometry (FC) is a convenient technique for this purpose. However, there is still no adequate way for data analysis, which would prevent the assignment of false positive or negative expression. METHODS: We have modified the currently most accepted technique, which uses the ratio of the mean fluorescent index (MFI) of B-CLL to T cells. The MFI for parallel antibody isotype staining is subtracted from the ZAP-70 MFI of both B-CLL and T cells. We validated this technique comparing the results obtained for ZAP-70 expression by FC with those obtained with quantitative PCR for the same patients. RESULTS: We applied the technique in a series of 53 patients. With this modification, a better correlation between ZAP-70 expression and IgV(H) UM was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the MFI ratio B-CLL/T cell corrected by isotype is a reliable analysis technique to estimate ZAP-70 expression in B-CLL.","['Marquez, M-E', 'Deglesne, P-A', 'Suarez, G', 'Romano, E']","['Marquez ME', 'Deglesne PA', 'Suarez G', 'Romano E']","['Laboratorio de Patologia Celular y Molecular, Centro de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas, Caracas, Venezuela. marmarqu@ivic.gob.ve']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', '*Immunoglobulin Isotypes/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01263.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Apr;33(2):194-200. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01263.x.

METHODS: Cell lines, including K562 (chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis) and K562r (imatinib-resistant K562), were exposed to dasatinib, nilotinib, rapamycin, bortezomib, and rapamycin plus imatinib. Cell proliferation was measured by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and mTOR signaling pathways were assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Dasatinib, nilotinib, and bortezomib inhibited proliferation of K562 and K562r cell lines at nm concentrations. Resistance of K562r due to duplication of autophosphorylation of wild-type Bcr-Abl was not overcome by dasatinib and nilotinib, but was sensitive to bortezomib. Rapamycin partially inhibited proliferation of K562 and K562r cell lines. Rapamycin plus imatinib did not have a more inhibitory effect on the proliferation of K562 and K562r cell lines. CONCLUSION: K562r due to duplication of autophosphorylation of wild-type Bcr-Abl induced by imatinib was still partially resistant to dasatinib and nilotinib, but this was overcome by incremental dosing. Rapamycin did not enhance imatinib sensitivity. The blockade of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway could be effective in overcoming resistance in the K562r imatinib-resistant cell line.","['Xing, H', 'Liu, T', 'Meng, W', 'Gong, Y']","['Xing H', 'Liu T', 'Meng W', 'Gong Y']","['Department of Haematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01267.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Apr;33(2):176-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01267.x.

Even though initial studies suggest that NF-&#x03BA;B inhibitors have antileukemic effects, their future clinical use will also depend on their toxicity profile.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Reikvam, Hakon']","['Bruserud O', 'Reikvam H']","['University of Bergen, Institute of Internal Medicine, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Editorial']",,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2010/10/15 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/10/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2010.525021 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2010 Nov;14(11):1139-42. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2010.525021.,,,,['Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2010 Nov;14(11):1157-76.

Some believe that cancer stem cells are derived from mutation of normal stem cells, whereas others suspect them to have different origins. Although complicated and controversial, the stem cell as the progenitor of cancer has found support in leukemia research, and subsequently in some solid tumors. It was first accepted that both stem and progenitor cells could acquire genetic abnormalities that would lead to uncontrolled replication and dysregulated differentiation, causing them to transform into cancerous stem cells that might then initiate and maintain a tumor. In this article, we discuss recent progress in the studies of stomach and intestinal cancer stem cells, while focusing on the complex molecular pathways underlying stem cell transformation and gastrointestinal tumorigenesis.

Rituximab is the most important monoclonal antibody of clinical value in these disorders. Rituximab is an IgG1 chimeric antibody containing murine light- and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. Since approval in 1997, rituximab has become the standard of care in follicular B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive lymphoma when combined with chemotherapy. Higher clinical benefits of rituximab can be seen in patients with CLL when it is added to other chemotherapeutic agents. Several recent reports have suggested that in patients with CLL, rituximab combined with purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs) or PNAs and cyclophosphamide may improve the results with acceptable toxicity, both in previously untreated and refractory/relapsed patients. The randomized, multinational Phase III study (REACH trial) has shown that rituximab combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC regimen) results in 10 months longer progression-free survival, and higher overall response and complete response rates than fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC regimen) in previously treated patients. The German CLL study group initiated a multicenter, multinational Phase III trial, CLL8, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of R-FC versus FC for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced CLL. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the R-FC arm (95%) compared with FC (88%). The complete response rate in the R-FC arm was 44% compared with 27% in the FC arm. The recently updated analysis has demonstrated longer overall survival in the R-FC group. Recent clinical observations have revealed that combinations of rituximab with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, or cladribine and cyclophosphamide are also highly active regimens in previously untreated CLL. In addition, the results of treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone in combination with rituximab in advanced CLL resistant to fludarabine have been reported recently by several groups. However, available therapies are only partially effective in CLL, exposing an obvious need to develop new, more specific and active drugs. Recently, several new anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been developed and are now being evaluated in clinical trials.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Robak, Pawel']","['Robak T', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Robak P']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-510 Lodz, ul.

In vivo and in vitro investigation.,568-71,,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was the investigation of antileukemic effect of amiodarone in leukemia P388 BDF1 bearing mice and its genotoxic and cytostatic effect in cultured normal human lymphocytes. METHODS: Leukemia P388 was used in this study. BDF1 mice were used for chemotherapy evaluation in vivo. The antitumor activity was assessed by the oncostatic parameter T/C, representing the increase of life span of drug-treated animals vs. controls. Lymphocyte cultures were used to study the genotoxic and cytostatic effect in vitro, expressed by enhanced sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and reduced proliferation rate indices (PRIS). RESULTS: Amiodarone was found to exert antileukemic potency against leukemia P388 bearing mice at all three different treatment schedules used, yielding T/C values of 155%, 163% with one cure and 230%. In the in vitro cytogenic experiments, significant increase of SCE rates by amiodarone was observed at 0.2 muM, while at the same concentration significant suppression of PRIS was achieved. CONCLUSION: According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a compound is characterized as potential chemotherapeutic deserving further evaluation if it produces T/C values>/=125%. On the other hand the SCE assay has predictive value as a clinical assay for drugs exhibiting a strong correlation between cell killing and induction of SCEs.

The anti-gp51 antibodies are present at high levels in the blood serum of cattle infected by bovine leukemia virus. Secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as specific fluorescent probes for detection of a particular target, because the fluorescence of HRP was readily detectable at the required sensitivity. The Ppy was used as fluorescent background, because its fluorescence was almost undetectable when excited by near UV light at 325 nm. Moreover the Ppy quenched the fluorescence of some fluorescent agents including fluorescein-5(6)-isothiocyanate (fluorescein), rhodamine B, and HRP by almost 100% when these fluorescent agents were adsorbed on the surface of Ppy.

Fascinating tools are tumour cells circulating in the peripheral blood of cancer patients. As these cells are extremely rare, they constitute a challenge for clinical diagnostics. In this contribution we present the Raman spectroscopic-based identification of different single cells in suspension that are found in peripheral blood of cancer patients including healthy cells like leukocytes and erythrocytes, and tumour cells like leukaemic cells and cells originating from solid tumours. Leukocytes and erythrocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors while myeloid leukaemia cells (OCI-AML3) and breast carcinoma derived cells (MCF-7, BT-20) were obtained from cell cultures. A laser emitting 785 nm light was used for optical trapping the single cells in the laser focus and to excite the Raman spectrum.

METHODS: In a case-control study in South East England to investigate the relation of acute and non-lymphocytic leukaemia risk to mobile phone use, 806 cases with leukaemia incident 2003-2009 at ages 18-59 years (50% of those identified as eligible) and 585 non-blood relatives as controls (provided by 392 cases) were interviewed about mobile phone use and other potentially aetiological variables. RESULTS: No association was found between regular mobile phone use and risk of leukaemia (odds ratio (OR)=1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.76, 1.46). Analyses of risk in relation to years since first use, lifetime years of use, cumulative number of calls and cumulative hours of use produced no significantly raised risks, and there was no evidence of any trends. A non-significantly raised risk was found in people who first used a phone 15 or more years ago (OR=1.87, 95% CI=0.96, 3.63). Separate analyses of analogue and digital phone use and leukaemia subtype produced similar results to those overall. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that use of mobile phones does not increase leukaemia risk, although the possibility of an effect after long-term use, while biologically unlikely, remains open.","['Cooke, R', 'Laing, S', 'Swerdlow, A J']","['Cooke R', 'Laing S', 'Swerdlow AJ']","['Section of Epidemiology, Sir Richard Doll Building, Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, UK.

Here, we describe a new role for alpha-actinin in inside-out integrin activation. In resting human platelets, alpha-actinin was associated with alphaIIbbeta3, whereas inside-out signaling (alphaIIbbeta3 activation signals) from protease-activated receptors (PARs) dephosphorylated and dissociated alpha-actinin from alphaIIbbeta3. We evaluated the time-dependent changes of the alphaIIbbeta3 activation state by measuring PAC-1 binding velocity. The initial velocity analysis clearly showed that PAR1-activating peptide stimulation induced only transient alphaIIbbeta3 activation, whereas PAR4-activating peptide induced long-lasting alphaIIbbeta3 activation. When alphaIIbbeta3 activation signaling dwindled, alpha-actinin became rephosphorylated and reassociated with alphaIIbbeta3. Compared with control platelets, the dissociation of alpha-actinin from alphaIIbbeta3 was only transient in PAR4-stimulated P2Y(12)-deficient platelets in which the sustained alphaIIbbeta3 activation was markedly impaired. Overexpression of wild-type alpha-actinin, but not the mutant Y12F alpha-actinin, increased its binding to alphaIIbbeta3 and inhibited PAR1-induced initial alphaIIbbeta3 activation in the human megakaryoblastic cell line, CMK. In contrast, knockdown of alpha-actinin augmented PAR-induced alphaIIbbeta3 activation in CMK. These observations suggest that alpha-actinin might play a potential role in setting integrins to a default low-affinity ligand-binding state in resting platelets and regulating alphaIIbbeta3 activation by inside-out signaling.","['Tadokoro, Seiji', 'Nakazawa, Tsuyoshi', 'Kamae, Tsuyoshi', 'Kiyomizu, Kazunobu', 'Kashiwagi, Hirokazu', 'Honda, Shigenori', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru', 'Tomiyama, Yoshiaki']","['Tadokoro S', 'Nakazawa T', 'Kamae T', 'Kiyomizu K', 'Kashiwagi H', 'Honda S', 'Kanakura Y', 'Tomiyama Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine C9, Osaka, Japan. tadokoro@hp-blood.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101012,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (P2RY12 protein, human)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, PAR-1)', '0 (Receptor, PAR-2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y12)', '11003-00-2 (Actinin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Actinin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, PAR-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, PAR-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y12/deficiency/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombasthenia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2010/10/14 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/10/14 06:00'],"['2010/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60162-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-246751 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 6;117(1):250-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-246751.

A role of the tissue microenvironment in the pathogenesis of CLL is hypothesized based on in vitro observations, but its contribution in vivo remains ill-defined. To elucidate the effects of tumor-host interactions in vivo, we purified tumor cells from 24 treatment-naive patients. Samples were obtained concurrently from blood, bone marrow, and/or LN and analyzed by gene expression profiling. We identified the LN as a key site in CLL pathogenesis. CLL cells in the LN showed up-regulation of gene signatures, indicating B-cell receptor (BCR) and nuclear factor-kappaB activation. Consistent with antigen-dependent BCR signaling and canonical nuclear factor-kappaB activation, we detected phosphorylation of SYK and IkappaBalpha, respectively. Expression of BCR target genes was stronger in clinically more aggressive CLL, indicating more effective BCR signaling in this subtype in vivo. Tumor proliferation, quantified by the expression of the E2F and c-MYC target genes and verified with Ki67 staining by flow cytometry, was highest in the LN and was correlated with clinical disease progression. These data identify the disruption of tumor microenvironment interactions and the inhibition of BCR signaling as promising therapeutic strategies in CLL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated second cancer and leukemia risks among 43,145 1-year survivors of CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or follicular lymphoma (FL) from 11 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based registries during 1992 to 2006. RESULTS: Among patients without HIV/AIDS-related lymphoma, lung cancer risks were significantly elevated after CLL/SLL and FL but not after DLBCL (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], CLL/SLL = 1.42, FL = 1.28, DLBCL = 1.00; Poisson regression P for difference among subtypes, P(Diff) = .001). A similar pattern was observed for risk of cutaneous melanoma (SIR: CLL/SLL = 1.92, FL = 1.60, DLBCL = 1.06; P(Diff) = .004). Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia risks were significantly elevated after FL and DLBCL, particularly among patients receiving initial chemotherapy, but not after CLL/SLL (SIR: CLL/SLL = 1.13, FL = 5.96, DLBCL = 4.96; P(Diff) < .001). Patients with HIV/AIDS-related lymphoma (n = 932) were predominantly diagnosed with DLBCL and had significantly and substantially elevated risks for second anal cancer (SIR = 120.50) and Kaposi's sarcoma (SIR = 138.90). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that differing immunologic alterations, treatments (eg, alkylating agent chemotherapy), genetic susceptibilities, and other risk factors (eg, viral infections, tobacco use) among lymphoma subtypes contribute to the patterns of second malignancy risk. Elucidating these patterns may provide etiologic clues to lymphoma as well as to the second malignancies.","['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Bluhm, Elizabeth C', 'Tucker, Margaret A', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Ries, Lynn A G', 'Fraumeni, Joseph F Jr']","['Morton LM', 'Curtis RE', 'Linet MS', 'Bluhm EC', 'Tucker MA', 'Caporaso N', 'Ries LA', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD 20892, USA. mortonli@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20101012,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Risk']",2010/10/14 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/10/14 06:00'],"['2010/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.29.1112 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.29.1112 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Nov 20;28(33):4935-44. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.29.1112.

It has been postulated that shortened telomeres, particularly in the context of increased telomerase activity, might facilitate accumulation of genetic aberrations and, consequently, disease progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase and blast crisis. Therefore, inhibition of telomerase might be a promising approach in CML therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To investigate the therapeutic potential of telomerase inhibition in this model disorder, we used a small molecule telomerase inhibitor, BIBR1532 as well as expression of a dominant-negative mutant of hTERT (DNhTERT-IRES-GFP) in the p53-negative CML blast crisis cell line K562 and characterized the effects in long-term culture. Furthermore, we expressed an inducible p53 construct (vector pBabe-p53ER(tam)) via retroviral transduction in cells with critically short telomeres and in cells with a normal telomere length to explain the role of the tumor suppressor in response to critical telomere shortening in BCR-ABL-positive cells. RESULTS: BIBR1532-treated bulk cultures did not show altered growth kinetics despite significant telomere shortening to a critical length of approximately 5 kb. In comparison, DNhTERT-expressing clones either lost telomere length, leading to a significant but transient slow down in proliferation but eventually all escaped senescence/crisis (group I) or, alternatively, remained virtually unaffected despite measurable telomerase inhibition (group II). Further analyses of group I clones revealed impaired DNA damage response and an accumulation of dicentric chromosomes. However, upon restoration of p53 in telomerase-negative K562 clones with critically short telomeres, immediate reinduction of apoptosis and complete eradication of cells was observed, whereas vector control cells continued to escape from crisis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the success of strategies aimed at telomerase inhibition in CML is highly dependent on the presence of functional p53 and should be explored preferentially in chronic phase CML.","['Brassat, Ute', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Bali, Daniel', 'Dierlamm, Judith', 'Braig, Melanie', 'Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Sirma, Huseyin', 'Gunes, Cagatay', 'Wege, Henning', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Gontarewicz, Artur', 'Dikomey, Ekkehard', 'Borgmann, Kerstin', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Brassat U', 'Balabanov S', 'Bali D', 'Dierlamm J', 'Braig M', 'Hartmann U', 'Sirma H', 'Gunes C', 'Wege H', 'Fehse B', 'Gontarewicz A', 'Dikomey E', 'Borgmann K', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101030,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Genes, abl', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Telomere', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2010/10/14 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/10/14 06:00'],"['2010/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00495-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Jan;39(1):66-76.e1-2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.10.001.

Most of the reported cases are extradural lesions or, on rare occasions, foci within another neoplasm such as hemangioblastoma, meningioma or pilocytic astrocytoma. Often these cases occur in patients with an underlying hematological disorder such as acute myelogenic leukemia, myelofibrosis, or other myelodysplastic syndromes. Such lesions have also been reported in thalassemia major. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 43-year-old Iranian woman in whom extramedullary hematopoiesis presented as a compressive cord lesion and then later as an intracranial lesion.

Therefore, Pim proteins are widely considered as attractive targets in cancer chemotherapy. Growing knowledge of mechanisms of Pim-mediated anti-apoptosis and transformation, as well as rapid progress in the design of Pim-modulating compounds dictate the need for an in-depth analysis of the chemistry of inhibitors and the modes of their interaction with these protein kinases. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the molecular events regulated by Pim proteins. In addition, we focus on the non-patent literature (mostly since 2005) that demonstrates a diversity of chemical classes of small molecular weight Pim inhibitors. The X-ray co-crystal structures of complexes Pim:inhibitor provide evidence for SAR data important for the choice of synthetic routes, optimization of lead compounds and testing chemical libraries.

Chronic heavy exposures to benzene have also been associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in humans. Other disease processes have also been studied, but have generally not been supported by epidemiologic studies of workers using benzene in the workplace. Within occupational cohorts with large populations and very low airborne benzene exposures (less than 0.1-1.0 ppm), it can be difficult to separate background disease incidence from those occurring due to occupational exposures. In the last few decades, some scientists and physicians have suggested that chronic exposures to various airborne concentrations of benzene may increase the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (Savitz and Andrews, 1997, Am J Ind Med 31:287-295; Smith et al., 2007, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 16:385-391), multiple myeloma (MM) (Goldstein, 1990, Ann NY Acad Sci 609:225-230; Infante, 2006, Ann NY Acad Sci 1076:90-109), and various other hematopoietic disorders. We present a state-of-the-science review of the medical and regulatory aspects regarding the hazards of occupational exposure to benzene. We also review the available scientific and medical evidence relating to benzene and the risk of developing various disorders following specific levels of exposure.

Earlier we designed a new NF-kappaB inhibitor, (-)-DHMEQ, and showed that it had potent anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities in various animal models without any toxicity. In the present research, we studied whether (-)-DHMEQ could be efficiently taken by cultured cells and irreversibly inhibit NF-kappaB by short time application to cultured cells. Even after mouse monocytic leukaemia RAW264.7 cells had been washed free of (-)-DHMEQ, lipopolysacharide (LPS)-induced activation of NF-kappaB in these cells was still inhibited. Moreover, topical application for 15 min was found to induce dormancy of the cells against LPS for 2-8 h. When it was topically added to RAW264.7 cells in which NF-kappaB was activated by LPS, the inhibition lasted at least for 2 h. NF-kappaB derectly upregulates expression of iNOS that produces NO. Short time application of (-)-DHMEQ also inhibited the function of cells in terms of NO production and iNOS induction in RAW264.7 cells.

METHODS: 91 primary liver tumors treated between 1991 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. HRHs as defined by the SIOP criteria (PRETEXT IV or any stage with venous involvement, extrahepatic disease, tumor rupture and <100 ng/ml serum AFP) were identified and imaging and biopsies were reviewed. The treatment consisted of total removal of the tumor, involving extended hepatectomies and LT if necessary, together with SIOPEL-guided chemotherapy. RESULTS: 23/57 hepatoblastomas were HRH (11F/12M). 17 were considered unresectable by standard techniques, 3 had extrahepatic disease, and 3 fulfilled both criteria. Mean age at diagnosis was 2.3 +/- 2.4 years. 3 children (referred after chemotherapy) died without surgery. 4 had resections (2 left and 2 right trisegmentectomies). Primary LT was required in 15 children (7 cadaveric donors and 8 living related donor transplantations (LRDT), 2 of them with retrohepatic vena cava replacement), and 1 patient had rescue LT after recurrence. Mean follow-up was 4.8 +/- 2.9 years. 2 children who had undergone liver resection developed pulmonary metastases at 1.7 and 1.6 years postoperatively and survived after surgical treatment. 2 children with LT developed EBV-related lymphoma and leukemia respectively but survived. Event-free survival (EFS) at 1, 5, and 10 years was 78.3 +/- 8.6%, 63.1 +/- 10.5%, and 63.1 +/- 10.5%, respectively. 6 children died (3 without surgery, 1 after liver resection, 1 after primary LT and 1 after rescue LT).

This molecular method can not only detect aberrations that are cytogenetically cryptic, such as t(12;21)(p13;q22) in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but is also very sensitive, and as such can be used to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD). Detecting and measuring MRD is important because it can be a guide to determining prognosis and relapse risk, predict recurrence of leukaemia, and enable individualization of treatment.","['Mason, Joanne', 'Griffiths, Mike']","['Mason J', 'Griffiths M']","[""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Statistics as Topic']",2010/10/13 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/10/13 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-947-5_18 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2011;688:269-80. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-947-5_18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multi-center phase 1/2 trial of XIAP antisense oligonucleotide AEG35156 in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine was conducted in 56 patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Herein we report the pharmacodynamic studies of the patients enrolled at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. A total of 13 patients were enrolled in our institution: five in phase 1 (12-350 mg/m(2) AEG35156) and eight in phase 2 (350 mg/m(2) AEG35156) of the protocol. AEG35156 was administered on 3 consecutive days and then weekly up to a maximum of 35 days. Blood samples were collected from patients on days 1 through 5 and on day 28-35 post-chemotherapy for detection of XIAP levels and apoptosis. AEG35156 treatment led to dose-dependent decreases of XIAP mRNA levels (42-100% reduction in phase 2 patients). XIAP protein levels were reduced in all five samples measured. Apoptosis induction was detected in 1/4 phase 1 and 4/5 phase 2 patients. Importantly, apoptosis was most pronounced in CD34+38- AML stem cells and all phase 2 patients showing apoptosis induction in CD34+38- cells achieved response. We conclude that at 350 mg/m(2), AEG35156 is effective in knocking down XIAP in circulating blasts accompanied by the preferential induction of apoptosis in CD34+38- AML stem cells.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Morris, Stephen J', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Byrd, Anna L', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak DH', 'Morris SJ', 'Borthakur G', 'Estey E', 'Byrd AL', 'Konopleva M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Flavopiridol was given IV as a 30-min loading dose followed by a 4-hr infusion weekly for 4 weeks repeated every 6 weeks. Dose-escalation was in cohorts of three patients using the standard 3+3 phase I study design. Blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received a total of 208 doses (median 7, range 1-24). Total doses ranged from 40 to 105 mg/m(2). The primary dose limiting toxicity was cytokine release syndrome (CKRS). No antitumor responses were observed. The mean peak plasma concentration across all doses was 1.65 +/- 0.86 muM. Area under the concentration-versus-time curve ([Formula: see text]) ranged from 4.31 to 32.2 muM[Symbol: see text]hr with an overall mean of 13.6 +/- 7.0 muM[Symbol: see text]hr. Plasma flavopiridol concentrations and AUC increased proportionally with dose. There was no correlation between cytokine levels and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum-tolerated dose of flavopiridol is 20 mg/m(2) bolus followed by 20 mg/m(2) infusion over 4 h given weekly for 4 weeks on a 6-week cycle in patients with advanced solid tumors. Flavopiridol PK was notably different, and there was a higher frequency of CKRS, despite prophylactic steroids, seen in this patient group compared to previous studies with CLL using a similar dosing schedule.","['Ramaswamy, Bhuvaneswari', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Baiocchi, Robert', 'Bekaii-Saab, Tanios', 'Ni, Wenjun', 'Lai, Ju-Ping', 'Wolfson, Anna', 'Lustberg, Mark E', 'Wei, Lai', 'Wilkins, Deidre', 'Campbell, Angela', 'Arbogast, Daria', 'Doyle, Austin', 'Byrd, John C', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Shah, Manisha H']","['Ramaswamy B', 'Phelps MA', 'Baiocchi R', 'Bekaii-Saab T', 'Ni W', 'Lai JP', 'Wolfson A', 'Lustberg ME', 'Wei L', 'Wilkins D', 'Campbell A', 'Arbogast D', 'Doyle A', 'Byrd JC', 'Grever MR', 'Shah MH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101012,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ohio', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/13 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2010/10/13 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9563-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Apr;30(2):629-38. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9563-7.

METHOD: Gender-stratified leukemia mortality data for children aged < 15 years from 1980 to 2006 were retrieved from the Brazilian Mortality Information System for the state of Rio de Janeiro. Data were stratified by place of death (city of Rio de Janeiro proper, the state capital; Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region, excluding the capital; and rest of the state). Leukemia deaths were defined according to death certificate ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding (for deaths occurring in 1980-1995 and 1996-2006, respectively). Leukemia mortality rates were calculated by age and calendar year and age-adjusted to a standard world population. Polynomial linear regression with a 5% significance level was used to evaluate mortality trends in the study regions. RESULTS: The three studied regions revealed similar trends, with a continuous downward pattern; the most substantial decline was detected in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro (city proper). In all studied areas, leukemia mortality was highest among males. CONCLUSION: A downward trend in childhood leukemia mortality was detected throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro. The most pronounced reduction occurred in the state capital.","['Couto, Arnaldo Cezar', 'Ferreira, Jeniffer Dantas', 'Koifman, Rosalina Jorge', 'Monteiro, Gina Torres Rego', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria Socorro', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['Couto AC', 'Ferreira JD', 'Koifman RJ', 'Monteiro GT', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Koifman S']","['Escola Nacional de Saude Publica Sergio Arouca (ENSP), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. arnaldocoutto@gmail.com']","['eng', 'por']",['Journal Article'],,Brazil,J Pediatr (Rio J),Jornal de pediatria,2985188R,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Sex Distribution']",2010/10/13 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2010/10/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2223/JPED.2027 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr (Rio J). 2010 Sep-Oct;86(5):405-10. doi: 10.2223/JPED.2027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To induce a graft-versus-adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma effect, we discontinued methylprednisolone and tacrolimus. About a month after the discontinuation, he developed grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with a high fever. Soon after the development of GVHD, all the skin lesions regressed in size and finally vanished. However, he developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), which was resistant to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. He was intubated for respiratory insufficiency on day 451. Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was administered at a dose of 1 g per day for 2 days and his oxygen saturation then improved, and ventilatory support was released on day 465.

Peripheral blood (PB) flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19 and CD34 was conducted in 35 patients and in controls. RESULTS: Hp-I was detected by: (a) serology in 75.34% of patients (p = 0.000), (b) INFAI in 57.69% of patients, (c) CLO in 60.71% of patients and (d) histological confirmation in 80.36% of patients (p = 0.001). No correlation between Hp-I and CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19 expression, leukemic transformation or death was observed. However, in 20 cases, significant variation in the PB lymphocytic proportion possibly attributable to Hp-I was ascertained, in contrast to the expected MDS ratio. CONCLUSION: Although there is no evidence for a causal relationship between Hp-I and MDS, the increased prevalence of Hp-I among the MDS patients is an interesting finding that deserves further investigation as it may indicate a common factor causing susceptibilities to both MDS and Hp-I or that Hp might influence the pathophysiology of MDS.","['Diamantidis, Michael D', 'Ioannidou-Papagiannaki, Elizabeth', 'Kountouras, Jannis', 'Mandala, Eudokia', 'Tsapournas, Georgios', 'Frida-Michailidou, Ifigenia', 'Klonizakis, Philippos', 'Zavos, Christos', 'Haralambidou-Vranitsa, Styliani', 'Vlachaki, Efthymia', 'Parapanisiou, Efthymia', 'Klonizakis, Ioannis']","['Diamantidis MD', 'Ioannidou-Papagiannaki E', 'Kountouras J', 'Mandala E', 'Tsapournas G', 'Frida-Michailidou I', 'Klonizakis P', 'Zavos C', 'Haralambidou-Vranitsa S', 'Vlachaki E', 'Parapanisiou E', 'Klonizakis I']","['Hematology Unit, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokration General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece. diamantidis79@yahoo.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101011,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Causality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Helicobacter Infections/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology', '*Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*complications/immunology']",2010/10/13 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['000319629 [pii]', '10.1159/000319629 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2010;124(3):141-9. doi: 10.1159/000319629.

METHODS: Within a large US health insurer database between January 2000 and June 2008, we conducted a retrospective observational study. We identified people with autoimmune diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or history of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, and a general population cohort. We developed a PML case-finding algorithm and validated PML diagnoses in medical charts. RESULTS: There were 138,469 patients with autoimmune diseases, 25,706 with NHL or CLL, and 8,778 with transplants. Among 699 people who met screening criteria for potential PML, 89 had a claim diagnosis of PML (International Classification of Diseases-9 046.3). Medical records were sought for 24 patients without HIV, and 6 had confirmed PML upon review of medical records. The PML IR was 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-13.18) in the systemic lupus erythematosus cohort and 10.8 (95% CI 0.27-60.39) in the autoimmune vasculitis cohort per 100,000 person-years. In the NHL and CLL cohorts, the IR was 8.3 (95% CI 1.71-24.24) and 11.1 (0.28-61.74) per 100,000 person-years. The IR among patients with bone marrow transplantation was 35.4 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 0.90-197.29). There were no cases of PML among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (95% CI 0.0-2.24), multiple sclerosis (95% CI 0.0-5.24), Sjogren disease (95% CI 0.0-21.84), or solid organ transplantation (95% CI 0.0-26.81). CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based investigation of PML with thorough case finding and a known source population, the IR of medical record-confirmed PML was rare in non-HIV patient cohorts.","['Amend, K L', 'Turnbull, B', 'Foskett, N', 'Napalkov, P', 'Kurth, T', 'Seeger, J']","['Amend KL', 'Turnbull B', 'Foskett N', 'Napalkov P', 'Kurth T', 'Seeger J']","['i3 Drug Safety, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, USA. kandace.amend@i3drugsafety.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Autoimmune Diseases/classification/immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Insurance, Health', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Health Programs/statistics & numerical data', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/13 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/10/13 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['75/15/1326 [pii]', '10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181f73600 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2010 Oct 12;75(15):1326-32. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181f73600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha mediates both apoptosis and inflammation, stimulating an inflammatory cascade through the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappaB activation, leading to increased nuclear RelB and p52. In contrast, the common food additive carrageenan (CGN) stimulates inflammation through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-kappaB activation and utilizes the adaptor molecule BCL10 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10). In a series of experiments, colonic epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TNF-alpha and carrageenan in order to simulate the possible effects of exposure to dietary CGN in the setting of a TNF-alpha-mediated inflammatory disease process. A marked increase in secretion of IL-8 occurred, attributable to synergistic effects on phosphorylated NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the non-canonical pathway. TNF-alpha induced the ubiquitination of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), which interacts with NIK, and CGN induced phosphorylation of BCL10, leading to increased NIK phosphorylation. These results suggest that TNF-alpha and CGN in combination act to increase NIK phosphorylation, thereby increasing activation of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappaB activation. In contrast, the apoptotic effects of TNF-alpha, including activation of caspase-8 and PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) fragmentation, were markedly reduced in the presence of CGN, and CGN caused reduced expression of Fas. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CGN drives TNF-alpha-stimulated cells toward inflammation rather than toward apoptotic cell death and suggest that CGN exposure may compromise the effectiveness of anti-TNF-alpha therapy.","['Bhattacharyya, Sumit', 'Dudeja, Pradeep K', 'Tobacman, Joanne K']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Dudeja PK', 'Tobacman JK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101011,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Food Additives)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Carrageenan/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Food Additives/chemistry', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2010/10/13 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/10/13 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)60647-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.159681 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Dec 10;285(50):39511-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.159681.

We therefore investigated whether XMRV infection could be found in patients with prostate cancer from the southern United States, and we sought to verify the association with the R462Q. METHODS: Prostate tissue specimens of 144 patients with prostate cancer from the southern United States were genotyped for R462Q by real time polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination and were screened for XMRV proviral DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction specific for the env gene. RESULTS: The R462Q polymorphism was found at an allelic frequency of 0.33. XMRV was detected in 32 (22%) of the 144 patients. Patients were significantly more likely to test positive for XMRV in both tumor and normal tissue rather than either alone (kappa = 0.64). A positive result for XMRV was not significantly correlated with the R462Q polymorphism (P = .82) or clinical pathological parameters of prostate cancer, including Gleason score (P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: XMRV is detectable in normal and tumor prostate tissue from patients with prostate cancer, independent of R462Q.

Molecular studies showed germline configuration of both immunoglobulin H and T cell receptor genes, and negative results for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER). He was treated with standard acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) induction therapy, followed by 1 cycle of high-dose MTX (HD-MTX) as consolidation therapy. However, BNKL relapsed during standard ALL maintenance therapy. Three cycles of HD-MTX were effective in achieving a second complete remission and then he received low dose MTX as maintenance therapy. BNKL remained well controlled for 4 years. Chemotherapeutic toxicity was mild and manageable. Since BNKL reportedly has a poor prognosis, this encouraging result warrants further investigation of MTX as either a single agent or in a combination regimen as a first-line treatment for patients with BNKL.","['Kobayashi, Shoko', 'Teramura, Masanao', 'Arai, Miyuki', 'Masuda, Akihiro', 'Mizoguchi, Hideaki', 'Motoji, Toshiko']","['Kobayashi S', 'Teramura M', 'Arai M', 'Masuda A', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Motoji T']","['Department of Hematology, Seirei Yokohama Hospital, 215 Iwai-cho Hodogaya-ku, Yokohama 240-8521, Japan. qqh558vd@mountain.ocn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20101009,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Salvage Therapy/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2009/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0660-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Nov;92(4):634-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0660-3.

CLL occurs in two forms, aggressive and indolent. Aggressive CLL is characterized by high ZAP-70 expression and unmutated IgH V(H); indolent CLL shows low ZAP-70 expression and mutated IgH V(H). We recently found that miR-29 is up-regulated in indolent human B-CLL, compared to aggressive B-CLL and normal CD19(+) B-cells. To determine the role of miR-29 in CLL, we generated transgenic mice over-expressing miR-29 in mouse B-cells. Recently we reported that miR-29 transgenic mice develop indolent CLL phenotype. Interestingly, our previous findings suggest that miR-29 targets expression of TCL1, a critical oncogene in aggressive CLL, indicating that miR-29 might function as a tumor suppressor in CLL.

TBI prescription was set in such a manner that 80% of the clinical target volume received 12 Gy in six fractions, at two fractions per day. Dose reconstruction was carried out by recontouring the regions of interest in the daily pretreatment megavoltage computed tomography of each individual fraction and calculating its corresponding dose. A deformable registration model was used for dose summation of all individual fractions. Differences between planned and delivered doses were calculated. Average planned and delivered doses to the regions of interest differed by up to 2.7%. TBI toxicity was limited to radiotherapy oncology group grade 1 dermatitis in all patients and grade 1 headache in one patient. Two patients are alive with no evidence of disease and no GVHD. Two patients died of GVHD, but there was no evidence of disease at the time of death. We conclude that HT simplifies the process of TBI.

However, the disease remains incurable because of the development of chemoresistance. Strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms are therefore highly needed. At least two mechanisms contribute to the development of resistance to drugs; acquired mutations resulting in a dysfunctional p53 response and shifts in the balance between apoptosis-regulating proteins. Platinum-based compounds have been successfully applied in relapsed lymphoma and recently also in high-risk CLL. In this study we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of cisplatinum (CDDP) in chemorefractory CLL. Independent of p53-functional status, CDDP acted synergistically with fludarabine (F-ara-A). The response involved generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which led to specific upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa. Induction of Noxa resulted in cell death by apoptosis as inhibition of caspase activation completely abrogated cell death. Furthermore, drug-resistance upon CD40-ligand stimulation, a model for the protective stimuli provided in lymph nodes, could also be overcome by CDDP/F-ara-A. ROS accumulation resulted in Noxa upregulation mainly at the transcriptional level and this was, at least in part, mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Finally, Noxa RNA-interference markedly decreased sensitivity to CDDP/F-ara-A, supporting a key role for Noxa as mediator between ROS signaling and apoptosis induction. Our data indicate that interference in the cellular redox balance can be exploited to overcome chemoresistance in CLL.","['Tonino, S H', 'van Laar, J', 'van Oers, M H', 'Wang, J Y', 'Eldering, E', 'Kater, A P']","['Tonino SH', 'van Laar J', 'van Oers MH', 'Wang JY', 'Eldering E', 'Kater AP']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101011,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/metabolism/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/04/09 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010441 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.441 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Feb 10;30(6):701-13. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.441.

ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemia cells is accompanied by a G0/G1 arrest, yet how ATRA couples cell cycle arrest to differentiation remains largely unknown. Here we observed that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) was activated upon ATRA treatment in the human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, NB4 and HL-60, as represented by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, the up-regulation of ubiquitin mRNA and increased 20S proteasome activity. Interestingly, we found that complete inhibition of proteasome activity suppressed ATRA-induced proliferation/differentiation (P/D) transition in both cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the exact protein contributing to this phenomenon is different in these two cell lines.

We have recently shown that Aven serves as an activator and substrate of ATM, thereby modulating the DNA-damage response and G(2)/M cell cycle progression. Under physiological conditions, the cellular localization of Aven is mainly cytosolic, but a small fraction of the protein is present in the nucleus. Here, we show that treatment of cells with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Exportin-1/CRM (chromosomal region maintenance) 1, resulted in nuclear accumulation of Aven. Furthermore, we identified a functional LR-NES between amino acid residues 282-292 of the human Aven protein, a sequence that is evolutionary conserved among a range of vertebrate species. Disruption of this LR-NES by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in enhanced nuclear localization of Aven, but did not alter the ability of the protein to induce G(2)/M cell cycle arrest in interphase Xenopus laevis extracts. However, elimination of the LR-NES sequence led to a reduction in the capacity of Aven to arrest Xenopus oocytes containing intact nuclei. Our results suggest that the regulation of nucleocytoplasmatic traffic of Aven could modulate its ability to influence cell cycle progression.","['Esmaili, Armond M', 'Johnson, Erika L', 'Thaivalappil, Silpa S', 'Kuhn, Helena M', 'Kornbluth, Sally', 'Irusta, Pablo M']","['Esmaili AM', 'Johnson EL', 'Thaivalappil SS', 'Kuhn HM', 'Kornbluth S', 'Irusta PM']","['Department of Human Science, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101025,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (AVEN protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oocytes/chemistry', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Xenopus laevis']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/03 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['13138 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.19.13138 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Oct 1;9(19):3913-20. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.19.13138.

Loss of function of either LATS1 or LATS2 leads to a variety of tumor types including soft tissue sarcomas, leukemia, as well as breast, prostate, lung and esophageal cancers. Due to their high degree of homology and functional overlap, LATS1 and LATS2 comprise a new tumor suppressor family. Classically identified within the Hippo-LATS signaling pathway, LATS also acts independently of this pathway, possessing multiple functions including regulation of cell proliferation, cell death and cell migration, as well as broad governing roles such as transcriptional regulation and maintenance of genetic stability. Activity of LATS is tightly controlled through various mechanisms including post-translational modifications, differential localization and expression. Although little is known about the specific underlying mechanisms of these activities, current data suggest that LATS signaling intersects with well-established tumor suppressive or oncogenic pathways including the p53, Ras or Akt networks. This review aims to identify what we know about the LATS tumor suppressor family, highlighting LATS1 and LATS2 redundancies and differences in terms of their structure, expression, regulation and functions, thereby establishing a novel tumor suppressor network.","['Visser, Stacy', 'Yang, Xiaolong']","['Visser S', 'Yang X']","[""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101020,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (LATS1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (LATS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/03 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['13386 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.19.13386 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Oct 1;9(19):3892-903. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.19.13386.

It is unclear whether leukaemia risk is elevated with protracted, low-dose exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis examining the relationship between protracted low-dose ionising radiation exposure and leukaemia. DATA SOURCES: Reviews by the National Academies and United Nations provided a summary of informative studies published before 2005. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for additional occupational and environmental studies published between 2005 and 2009. STUDY SELECTION: We selected 23 studies that: (1) examined the association between protracted exposures to ionising radiation and leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic subtype; (2) were a cohort or nested case-control design without major bias; (3) reported quantitative estimates of exposure; and (4) conducted exposure-response analyses using relative or excess RR per unit exposure. METHODS: Studies were further screened to reduce information overlap. Random effects models were developed to summarise between-study variance and obtain an aggregate estimate of the excess RR at 100 mGy. Publication bias was assessed by trim and fill and Rosenthal's file drawer methods. RESULTS: We found an ERR at 100 mGy of 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.32) by modelling results from 10 studies and adjusting for publication bias. Between-study variance was not evident (p=0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Protracted exposure to low-dose gamma radiation is significantly associated with leukaemia. Our estimate agreed well with the leukaemia risk observed among exposed adults in the Life Span Study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors, providing increased confidence in the current understanding of leukaemia risk from ionising radiation. However, unlike the estimates obtained from the LSS, our model provides a precise, quantitative summary of the direct estimates of excess risk from studies of protracted radiation exposures.","['Daniels, R D', 'Schubauer-Berigan, M K']","['Daniels RD', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK']","['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4676 Columbia Pkwy, R-14, Cincinnati, OH 45226, USA.

To test the hypothesis that lymphocyte recovery mirrors ontogeny, we characterized early lymphocyte recovery in 20 consecutive patients undergoing induction timed sequential chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. Recovering T lymphocytes were predominantly CD4(+) and included a greatly expanded population of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells. Recovering CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells were phenotypically activated regulatory T cells and showed suppressive activity on cytokine production in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Despite an initial burst of thymopoiesis, most recovering regulatory T cells were peripherally derived. Furthermore, regulatory T cells showed marked oligoclonal skewing, suggesting that their peripheral expansion was antigen-driven. Overall, lymphocyte recovery after chemotherapy differs from ontogeny, specifically identifying a peripherally expanded oligoclonal population of activated regulatory T lymphocytes. These differences suggest a stereotyped immunologic recovery shared by patients with newly diagnosed AML after induction timed sequential chemotherapy. Further insight into this oligoclonal regulatory T-cell population will be fundamental toward developing effective immunomodulatory techniques to improve survival for patients with AML.","['Kanakry, Christopher G', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Thoburn, Christopher', 'Kos, Ferdynand', 'Meyer, Christian', 'Briel, Janet', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Levitsky, Hyam', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Kanakry CG', 'Hess AD', 'Gocke CD', 'Thoburn C', 'Kos F', 'Meyer C', 'Briel J', 'Luznik L', 'Smith BD', 'Levitsky H', 'Karp JE']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, The Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101008,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'FLAM regimen']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)59209-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-277939 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 13;117(2):608-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-277939.

APL cell treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) degrades the chimeric, dominant-negative-acting transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML)/RARalpha, which is generated in APL by chromosomal translocation. The E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBE1L) associates with interferon-stimulated gene ISG15 that binds and represses PML/RARalpha protein. Ubiquitin protease UBP43/USP18 removes ISG15 from conjugated proteins. In this study, we explored how RA regulates UBP43 expression and the effects of UBP43 on PML/RARalpha stability and APL growth, apoptosis, or differentiation. RA treatment induced UBE1L, ISG15, and UBP43 expression in RA-sensitive but not RA-resistant APL cells. Similar in vivo findings were obtained in a transgenic mouse model of transplantable APL, and in the RA response of leukemic cells harvested directly from APL patients. UBP43 knockdown repressed PML/RARalpha protein levels and inhibited RA-sensitive or RA-resistant cell growth by destabilizing the PML domain of PML/RARalpha.

Herein, we demonstrate that berberine induces apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells by downregulating the MDM2 oncoprotein. The proapoptotic effects of berberine were closely associated with both the MDM2 expression levels and p53 status of a set of ALL cell lines. The most potent apoptosis was induced by berberine in ALL cells with both MDM2 overexpression and a wild-type (wt)-p53, whereas no proapoptotic effect was detected in ALL cells that were negative for MDM2 and wt-p53. In contrast to the conventional chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, which induces p53 activation and a subsequent upregulation of MDM2, berberine strongly induced persistent downregulation of MDM2 followed by a steady-state activation of p53. We discovered that downregulation of MDM2 in ALL cells by berberine occurred at a posttranslational level through modulation of death domain-associated protein (DAXX), which disrupted the MDM2-DAXX-HAUSP interactions and thereby promoted MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation. Given that MDM2-overexpressing cancer cells are commonly chemoresistant, our findings suggest that this naturally derived agent may have a highly useful role in the treatment of cancer patients with refractory disease.","['Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Li, Jiansha', 'Shah, Noopur', 'He, Jing', 'Yang, Lin', 'Hu, Qun', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Zhang X', 'Gu L', 'Li J', 'Shah N', 'He J', 'Yang L', 'Hu Q', 'Zhou M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Berberine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1546 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1546 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Dec 1;70(23):9895-904. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1546.

The core Notch transcriptional activation complex can bind DNA as a monomer, but it can also dimerize on DNA-binding sites that are properly oriented and spaced. However, the significance of Notch dimerization is unknown. Here, we show that dimeric Notch transcriptional complexes are required for T-cell maturation and leukemic transformation but are dispensable for T-cell fate specification from a multipotential precursor. The varying requirements for Notch dimerization result from the differential sensitivity of specific Notch target genes. In particular, c-Myc and pre-T-cell antigen receptor alpha (Ptcra) are dimerization-dependent targets, whereas Hey1 and CD25 are not. These findings identify functionally important differences in the responsiveness among Notch target genes attributable to the formation of higher-order complexes. Consequently, it may be possible to develop a new class of Notch inhibitors that selectively block outcomes that depend on Notch dimerization (e.g., leukemogenesis).","['Liu, Hudan', 'Chi, Anthony W S', 'Arnett, Kelly L', 'Chiang, Mark Y', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Wang, Hongfang', 'Li, Yue-Ming', 'Bhandoola, Avinash', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Liu H', 'Chi AW', 'Arnett KL', 'Chiang MY', 'Xu L', 'Shestova O', 'Wang H', 'Li YM', 'Bhandoola A', 'Aster JC', 'Blacklow SC', 'Pear WS']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (pre-T cell receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gad.1975210 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1975210 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Nov 1;24(21):2395-407. doi: 10.1101/gad.1975210.

Perturbation of this element causes the assembly of aberrant, non-infectious virus particles. To determine whether this element is conserved in gammaretroviruses such as the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), we examined the effects of insertion mutations in the N-terminal portion of the MLV NC coding region. Interestingly, we found that insertions of as many as twenty residues after the twelfth residue of MLV NC yielded proteins that directed the efficient assembly of virus particles. Virus morphologies and crosslink profiles appeared normal, and assembled viruses retained significant levels of infectivity in single cycle infection assays. Two variants were examined in the context of replicating virus constructs, and the mutations were found to be maintained during multiple rounds of infection in a cell culture system. These results suggest that the alpharetrovirus and lentivirus assembly elements either are not needed for gammaretroviruses, or are replaced by an alternative assembly element. Our results also indicate that the N-terminal region of MLV NC is amenable to genetic manipulation.","['Still, Amelia', 'Huseby, Douglas', 'Barklis, Eric']","['Still A', 'Huseby D', 'Barklis E']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, United States. astill@wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101008,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,['0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', '*Virus Replication']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-1702(10)00360-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2010.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2011 Jan;155(1):181-8. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2010.10.001.

The transcriptional activity of ERalpha can be regulated by particular estrogen receptor modulators. Celastrol, a quinine methide triterpene extracted from a Chinese medicine (Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F.), has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy against various cancer cells, including prostate cancer, leukemia, and melanoma cells. However, ERalpha regulation by Celastrol has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of Celastrol on the growth of breast cancer cells. We observed that Celastrol decreased expression of ERalpha at both the mRNA and the protein levels in MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. Results from a luciferase assay showed that Celastrol decreased the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. Also, Celastrol treatment inhibited ERalpha target gene expression, including expressions of cyclin D(1), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-Myb leading to cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition of breast cancer cells.

Similarly, menthol, a common food additive is also known to cause urticaria, asthma, and rhinitis. However, despite the obvious clinical implications, the molecular mechanisms responsible for inducing allergic responses to low temperatures and menthol have not been determined. Because a non-selective cation channel, transient receptor potential subtype M8 (TRPM8) is activated by cold and menthol, we hypothesized that this channel mediates cold- and menthol-induced histamine release in mast cells. Here, we report that TRPM8 is expressed in the basophilic leukemia mast cell line, RBL-2H3, and that exposure to menthol or low temperatures induced Ca(2+) influx in RBL-2H3 cells, which was reversed by a TRPM8 blocker. Furthermore, menthol, a TRPM8 agonist, induced the dose-dependent release of histamine from RBL-2H3 cells. When TRPM8 transcripts were reduced by siRNA (small interfering RNA), menthol- and cold-induced Ca(2+) influx and histamine release were significantly reduced. In addition, subcutaneous injection of menthol evoked scratching, a typical histamine-induced response which was reversed by a TRPM8 blocker. Thus, our findings indicate that TRPM8 mediates the menthol- and cold-induced allergic responses of mast cells, and suggest that TRPM8 antagonists be viewed as potential treatments for cold- and menthol-induced allergies.","['Cho, Yeongyo', 'Jang, Yongwoo', 'Yang, Young Duk', 'Lee, Chang-Hun', 'Lee, Yunjong', 'Oh, Uhtaek']","['Cho Y', 'Jang Y', 'Yang YD', 'Lee CH', 'Lee Y', 'Oh U']","['Sensory Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101012,Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '1490-04-6 (Menthol)', '23D4W0B50Y (Fluo-3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cold Temperature', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', '*Histamine Release', 'Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Menthol/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rats', 'TRPM Cation Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xanthenes/pharmacology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0143-4160(10)00126-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ceca.2010.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 2010 Oct;48(4):202-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ceca.2010.09.001.

Thus, selective targeting and killing of LICs would provide highly efficient and novel therapeutic strategies. Here we explored whether we could use a canine leukemia cell line (G374) derived from a dog that received HOXB4-transduced repopulating cells to study leukemia in the murine xenograft model and the dog. MATERIALS AND METHODS: G374 cells were infused in dogs intravenously and in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient and nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient/IL2Rgamma(null) mice either intravenously or directly into the bone cavity. Animals were bled to track engraftment and proliferation of G374 cells, and were sacrificed when they appeared ill. RESULTS: We found that canine LICs are capable of sustained in vitro self-renewal while maintaining their ability to induce acute myeloid leukemia, which resembles human disease in both dogs and mice. Furthermore, we developed a novel strategy for the quantification of LIC frequency in large animals and showed that this frequency was highly comparable to that determined by limited dilution in mouse xenotransplants. We also demonstrated, using single-cell analysis, that LICs are heterogeneous in their self-renewal capacity and regenerate a leukemic cell population consistent with a hierarchical leukemia model. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of this novel framework should accelerate the characterization of LICs and the translation of animal studies into clinical trials.","['Imren, Suzan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter']","['Imren S', 'Zhang XB', 'Humphries RK', 'Kiem HP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. simren@bccrc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00493-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Jan;39(1):124-32. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.012.

To test this hypothesis, we introduced positive charges into MMLV RT by site-directed mutagenesis at positions that have been implicated in the interaction with T/P. Thirty-six variants were constructed in which one of the twelve residues (Glu69, Gln84, Asp108, Asp114, Glu117, Glu123, Asp124, Glu286, Glu302, Trp313, Leu435, and Asn454) was replaced with Lys, Arg, or Ala, and these were expressed in Escherichia coli. In about half of these 36 variants, thermal inactivation at 50 degrees C was reduced in the presence of the T/P, which suggested that this strategy was effective at stabilizing MMLV RT. We next combined three of the 36 mutations, Glu286-->Ala, Glu302-->Lys, and Leu435-->Arg, and the mutation, Asp524-->Ala, which is known to abolish the RNase H activity and increase the stability. Temperatures of 54 and 56 degrees C reduced the initial reverse transcription activity by 50% over a 10-min incubation in the triple variant E286R/E302K/L435R and quadruple variant E286R/E302K/L435R/D524A, respectively. These temperatures were higher than that observed for WT (45 degrees C). The highest temperature at which the triple and quadruple variants exhibited cDNA synthesis activity was 60 degrees C, which was again higher than for WT (54 degrees C). Thus, highly stable MMLV RT variants were generated by this mutation strategy.","['Yasukawa, Kiyoshi', 'Mizuno, Masaki', 'Konishi, Atsushi', 'Inouye, Kuniyo']","['Yasukawa K', 'Mizuno M', 'Konishi A', 'Inouye K']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. yasukawa@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,Netherlands,J Biotechnol,Journal of biotechnology,8411927,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hot Temperature', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed/*methods', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-1656(10)01895-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.09.961 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biotechnol. 2010 Nov;150(3):299-306. doi: 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.09.961.

Both hairpins (SL-C and SL-D) contain GACG tetraloops that, in isolated RNAs, are capable of forming ""kissing"" interactions stabilized by two intermolecular G-C base pairs. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the double hairpin from the Moloney murine leukemia virus ([Psi(CD)](2), 132 nt, 42.8 kDa) using a (2)H-edited NMR-spectroscopy-based approach. This approach enabled the detection of (1)H-(1)H dipolar interactions that were not observed in previous studies of isolated SL-C and SL-D hairpin RNAs using traditional (1)H-(1)H correlated and (1)H-(13)C-edited NMR methods. The hairpins participate in intermolecular cross-kissing interactions (SL-C to SL-D' and SLC' to SL-D) and stack in an end-to-end manner (SL-C to SL-D and SL-C' to SL-D') that gives rise to an elongated overall shape (ca 95 Ax45 Ax25 A). The global structure was confirmed by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), making [Psi(CD)](2) simultaneously the smallest RNA to be structurally characterized to date by cryo-ET and among the largest to be determined by NMR. Our findings suggest that, in addition to promoting dimerization, [Psi(CD)](2) functions as a scaffold that helps initiate virus assembly by exposing a cluster of conserved UCUG elements for binding to the cognate nucleocapsid domains of assembling viral Gag proteins.","['Miyazaki, Yasuyuki', 'Irobalieva, Rossitza N', 'Tolbert, Blanton S', 'Smalls-Mantey, Adjoa', 'Iyalla, Kilali', 'Loeliger, Kelsey', ""D'Souza, Victoria"", 'Khant, Htet', 'Schmid, Michael F', 'Garcia, Eric L', 'Telesnitsky, Alice', 'Chiu, Wah', 'Summers, Michael F']","['Miyazaki Y', 'Irobalieva RN', 'Tolbert BS', 'Smalls-Mantey A', 'Iyalla K', 'Loeliger K', ""D'Souza V"", 'Khant H', 'Schmid MF', 'Garcia EL', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Chiu W', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"[""*5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Dimerization', 'Electron Microscope Tomography', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/physiology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",2010/10/12 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(10)00968-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2010.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 Dec 17;404(5):751-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.09.009.

In search of less toxic alternatives, we hypothesized that combination of busulfan (Bu), fludarabine (Flu) and clofarabine (Clo) would provide superior efficacy. At low concentrations, these drugs show synergistic cytotoxicity in Bu-resistant AML KBM3/Bu250(6) cells. Similar molecular responses were observed in other AML cell lines and in primary explanted AML cells. The [Clo+Flu+Bu] combination activates an intense DNA damage response through the ATM pathway, leading to cell cycle checkpoint activation and apoptosis. Phosphorylations of SMC1 and SMC3, and methylations of histones 3 and 4, are much more pronounced in cells exposed to [Clo+Flu+Bu] than [Clo+Flu], suggesting their relevance in the efficacy of the triple-drug combination. A possible mechanism for these observed synergistic effects involves the capability of [Clo+Flu] to induce histone methylations and subsequent chromatin remodeling, which may render the genomic DNA more accessible to Bu alkylation. The Bu-mediated DNA cross-linking may provide a feedback loop which perpetuates the DNA damage response initiated by [Clo+Flu] and commits the cells to apoptosis. Our results provide a conceptual mechanistic basis for exploring this triple-drug combination in pretransplant conditioning therapy for allo-HSCT.","['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Li, Yang', 'Murray, David', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Li Y', 'Murray D', 'Champlin RE', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. bvaldez@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101008,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/01/19 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00756-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.09.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Jan 15;81(2):222-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.09.027.

Our aim was to investigate convergence and divergence between these perspectives and thereby examine the validity of unitary theory of emotionality and authority in clinical relationships. METHODS: 33 audiorecorded parent-doctor consultations and separate interviews with parents and doctors, which we analysed qualitatively and from which we selected three prototype cases. RESULTS: Across the whole sample doctors' sense of relationship generally converged with our observations of consultation, but parents' sense of relationship diverged strongly from each. Contrary to current assumptions, parents' sense of emotional connection with doctors did not depend on doctors' emotional behaviour, and parents did not feel disempowered by doctors' authority. Moreover, authority and emotionality were not conceptually distinct for parents, who gained emotional support from doctors' exercise of authority. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships looked very different from the three perspectives. These divergences indicate weaknesses in current ideas of emotionality and authority in clinical relationships and the necessity of multisource datasets to develop these ideas in a way that characterises clinical relationships from all perspectives. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Methodological development will be needed to address the challenges posed by multisource datasets.","['Young, Bridget', 'Ward, Jo', 'Forsey, Mary', 'Gravenhorst, Katja', 'Salmon, Peter']","['Young B', 'Ward J', 'Forsey M', 'Gravenhorst K', 'Salmon P']","['Division of Clinical Psychology, School of Population Community and Behavioural Sciences, University of Liverpool, UK. byoung@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,Ireland,Patient Educ Couns,Patient education and counseling,8406280,,,"['Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Observation', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Professional-Family Relations', 'Psychological Theory', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Sociometric Techniques', 'United Kingdom']",2010/10/12 06:00,2012/01/21 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0738-3991(10)00548-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pec.2010.08.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Patient Educ Couns. 2011 Oct;85(1):60-7. doi: 10.1016/j.pec.2010.08.027.

Based on the fact, we have studied the effect of three natural antioxidants curcumin, silymarin and acteoside on AP9-cd (standardized lignan composition from Cedrus deodara) induced cytotoxicity in human leukemia HL-60 cells. The antioxidant potential of individual test compounds was first evaluated with ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) test, which revealed that all four molecules behave as antioxidants. The apoptotic potential of AP9-cd was significantly enhanced in HL-60 cells in the presence of curcumin, silymarin and acteoside. It was confirmed by using various models like MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, nuclei condensation, sub-Go DNA population, Annexin-V-FITC binding, ROS depletion and immunoblotting in HL-60 cells. AP9-cd and individual antioxidants alone at low doses (10mug and 10muM, respectively) have meager or no cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells, whereas in mutual combinations, there were 2-3 times enhancement in Annexin-V-FITC and sub-Go DNA population. Moreover, prominent DNA ladders were observed at low doses of AP9-cd in combinations with various antioxidants. The Hoechst staining of the nucleus also revealed the same results for the HL-60 cells treated with AP9-cd and different antioxidants. The molecular diagnostics revealed that the combinations induced a strong antioxidant effect which was correlated with the downregulation of NF-kappaB expression in the nucleus. Out of the three antioxidants, curcumin was found to be more potent than acteoside and silymarin in terms of enhancing the apoptotic potential of AP9-cd. These results propose an important role of natural antioxidant as adjuvant to enhance the anticancer potential of AP9-cd and more likely other anti-neoplastic therapeutics.","['Saxena, Arpita', 'Saxena, A K', 'Singh, Jaswant', 'Bhushan, Shashi']","['Saxena A', 'Saxena AK', 'Singh J', 'Bhushan S']","['Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu Tawi 180001, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"[""0 (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate)"", '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Products/*pharmacology', 'Cedrus/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ferric Compounds/metabolism', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Necrosis/chemically induced', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(10)00575-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2010.09.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Dec 5;188(3):580-90. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2010.09.029.

Treatment with CWJ-081 exhibited a characteristic feature of apoptosis including externalization of phosphatidylserine and formation of DNA fragmentation in human leukemia cell lines (HL-60, U-937, K-562). In addition, stimulation of HL-60 cells with CWJ-081 induced a series of intracellular events: (1) the activations of caspase-8, -9, and -3; (2) the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1); (3) the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)); (4) the release of cytochrome c; and (5) the modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. We further demonstrated that CWJ-081 induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) markedly inhibited the CWJ-081-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Moreover, CWJ-081-induced apoptosis was suppressed in the presence of SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor. Taken together, these data suggest that CWJ-081 induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in HL-60 cells, and ROS-mediated JNK activation plays a key role in the CWJ-081-induced apoptosis.","['Won, So-Jung', 'Chung, Kyung-Sook', 'Ki, Yo Sook', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Cho, Won-Jea', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Won SJ', 'Chung KS', 'Ki YS', 'Choi JH', 'Cho WJ', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100918,England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (CWJ-081)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0960-894X(10)01379-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.09.078 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2010 Nov 15;20(22):6447-51. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.09.078.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 13-year-old boy was referred to our department for bullous lesions on sun-exposed areas. His past medical history revealed acute biphenotypic leukaemia with complete remission after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (unrelated donor). Complications of bone marrow transplant comprised anaemia (treated by blood transfusions), primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, pulmonary aspergillosis and acute digestive graft-versus-host disease. The diagnosis of type I sporadic PCT was based on high levels of porphyria and normal erythrocytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity. The bullous lesions disappeared on bleeding, but the patient subsequently developed sclerodermiform lesions. DISCUSSION: An association between PCT and bone marrow transplant has been reported previously in two independent cases, of which one involved a child. The causative role of bone marrow transplantation in the development of PCT could be related to several triggering factors: primary CMV infection, hepatotoxic drugs, blood transfusion and possible chronic hepatic graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSION: We report the second case in a child of type I PCT associated with bone marrow transplantation.

Recently, a potential role for LATS2 in cancer has been reported. In breast cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), LATS2 mRNA is downregulated and has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor. However, the role of LATS2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma has not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression pattern of LATS2 and its clinicopathological involvement in nasopharyngeal carcinoma to understand its effect on cell survival. METHODS: Using quantitative real time PCR and immunoblotting, the expression of LATS2 was detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and in the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP69. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed LATS2 protein expression in 220 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases. The association of LATS2 protein expression with the clinicopathological characteristics and the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were subsequently assessed. Using methylation specific PCR, we detected the methylation status of the LATS2 promoter. RNA interference was performed by transfecting siRNA to specifically knock down LATS2 expression in 5-8F and CNE2. RESULTS: LATS2 protein was detected in 178 of 220 (80.91%) cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. LATS2 overexpression was a significant, independent prognosis predictor (P = 0.037) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Methylation specific PCR revealed that 36.7% (11/30) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and all of the chronic nasopharyngeal inflammation samples were methylated. Functional studies showed that the suppression of LATS2 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (5-8F and CNE2) cell lines by using specific small interfering (siRNA) resulted in the inhibition of growth, induction of apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle increase. Overexpression of LATS2 in NP69 stimulated cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LATS2 might play a role in the tumorigenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by promoting the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Transfection with specific siRNA might be feasible for the inhibition of growth, induction of apoptosis and S phase increase in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","['Zhang, Yan', 'Hu, Chun-Fang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Yan, Li-Xu', 'Zeng, Yi-Xin', 'Shao, Jian-Yong']","['Zhang Y', 'Hu CF', 'Chen J', 'Yan LX', 'Zeng YX', 'Shao JY']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (LATS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'RNA Interference', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-538 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-538 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Oct 8;10:538. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-538.,,PMC2958949,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vertical transmission and sexual intercourse are the major routes of transmission. Women are at greater risk of contracting the virus as it is more efficiently transmitted from male to female than in the reverse. Prevention of transmission is best achieved by health education on safe practices. The study aims to document the knowledge, attitude and behaviour pattern (KABP) of a group of women five years after they had participated in a mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1 risk reduction study. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a 46-point structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to capture data from 88 mothers. Overall knowledge scores were computed and four rating categories created. There were large deficiencies in the knowledge and practice of women at risk of being infected with HTLV-1. Only 58% knew that HTLV-1 is sexually transmitted. A minority was aware of HTLV-1 associated diseases: Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia (ATL) -30.7%; Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) -42%; Infective dermatitis -42%). Ten (11.4%) believed that HTLV-1 infection can cause HIV/AIDS and only 33% knew that there was no cure for the virus. Most women (88.6%) continued to have unprotected sex. Controlling HTLV-1 spread must be based on interrupting transmission. In Jamaica, donated blood is screened for HTLV-1 and sharing of infected needle is an insignificant mode of transmission. However although safe practices in breastfeeding and sexual intercourse are proven ways to reduce HTLV-1 transmission, these data show that knowledge and safe practices among those at risk may not be retained and health education will need to be sustained.","['Cooper, C M Jones', 'James, K', 'Wilks, R J']","['Cooper CM', 'James K', 'Wilks RJ']","['Department of Community Health and Psychiatry, The University of the West Indies, Kingston 7, Jamaica, West Indies. mbenz79@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Jamaica,West Indian Med J,The West Indian medical journal,0417410,,IM,"['Adult', '*Breast Feeding', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Health Education', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Jamaica/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mothers', 'Regression Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2010/10/12 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/10/12 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['1160 [pii]'],ppublish,West Indian Med J. 2010 Jan;59(1):35-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The 9 patients with VT involved chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 21 besides chromosomes 9 and 22, and some of them showed recurrent aberrations; FISH results were positive and the signal feature was 2R2G1Y. The 2 Ph-negative CML patients had normal karyotypes; FISH was positive and the signal feature was 1R1G2Y and 1R1G1Y respectively. CONCLUSION: FISH can provide better diagnosis for CML with VT and Ph-negative CML. Abnormal karyotype and marker gene changes can be assessed based on the signal feature of the positive cell.

In a large-scale miRNA expression profiling analysis of 435 human miRNAs in 52 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, we found that miR-126 and its minor counterpart in biogenesis, namely, miR-126*, were specifically aberrantly overexpressed in core binding factor (CBF) AMLs including both t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and inv(16)/CBFB-MYH11 samples. Our in vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that forced expression of miR-126 inhibited apoptosis and increased the viability of AML cells, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous expression of miR-126 was knocked down. In addition, through in vitro colony-forming/replating assays, we demonstrated that forced expression of miR-126 enhanced proliferation and colony-forming/replating capacity of mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells alone and particularly, in cooperation with AML1-ETO, a fusion gene resulting from t(8;21). Thus, our data shows that miR-126 may play a critical role in the development of CBF leukemias.

Nine recently published leukaemia risk models, developed with the Japanese A-bomb epidemiological mortality data, have been included in a model-averaging procedure so that the main conclusions do not depend on just one type of model or statistical test. The models have been centred here at various adult and young ages at exposure, for some short times since exposure, in order to obtain specially computed childhood Excess Relative Risks (ERR) with uncertainties that account for correlations in the fitted parameters associated with the ERR dose-response. The model-averaged ERR at 1 Sv was not found to be statistically significant for attained ages of 7 and 12 years but was statistically significant for attained ages of 17, 22 and 55 years. Consequently, such risks when applied to other situations, such as children in the vicinity of nuclear installations or in estimates of the proportion of childhood leukaemia incidence attributable to background radiation (i.e. low doses for young ages and short times since exposure), are only of very limited value, with uncertainty ranges that include zero risk. For example, assuming a total radiation dose to a 5-year-old child of 10 mSv and applying the model-averaged risk at 10 mSv for a 7-year-old exposed at 2 years of age would result in an ERR=0.33, 95% CI: -0.51 to 1.22. One model (United Nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation report. Volume 1. Annex A: epidemiological studies of radiation and cancer, United Nations, New York, 2006) weighted model-averaged risks of leukaemia most strongly by half of the total unity weighting and is recommended for application in future leukaemia risk assessments that continue to ignore model uncertainty. However, on the basis of the analysis presented here, it is generally recommended to take model uncertainty into account in future risk analyses.","['Walsh, Linda', 'Kaiser, Jan Christian']","['Walsh L', 'Kaiser JC']","['Department Radiation Protection and Health, Federal Office for Radiation Protection, Ingolstadter Landstr. 1, 85764, Oberschleissheim, Germany. lwalsh@bfs.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101008,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Uncertainty', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-010-0337-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2011 Mar;50(1):21-35. doi: 10.1007/s00411-010-0337-6.

To obtain reproducible FTIR absorbance spectra at the necessary spatial resolution we optimized sample preparation and acquisition parameters on a single channel Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) detector in the spectral interval of frequencies from 4000 to 800 cm(-1). Single K562 cells were illuminated by Synchrotron Radiation (SR) and a number of ~15 K562 cells spread in monolayer were illuminated by a conventional IR source (Globar), respectively. Combining IR spectral data with the results of complementary biochemical investigations carried out in samples by different analytical methods we identified and cross-validated IR signatures of drugs targeting the oncogenic protein BCR/ABL and its associated abnormal tyrosine kinase activity in K562 cell line. Unsupervised pattern recognition performed by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) clustered the spectra of single K562 cells in two distinct groups roughly corresponding to living and to apoptotic cells, respectively. The corresponding IR spectral profiles were assumed to represent drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cells. Significant variations with increasing percentages of apoptotic cells were observed after the treatment of K562 cells with drugs that directly or indirectly target BCR/ABL. In conclusion, we suggest that microFTIR associated with multivariate data analysis may be useful to assess drug compounds in ex vivo cancer cell models and possibly peripheral blast cells from CML patients.","['Bellisola, Giuseppe', 'Della Peruta, Marco', 'Vezzalini, Marzia', 'Moratti, Elisabetta', 'Vaccari, Lisa', 'Birarda, Giovanni', 'Piccinini, Massimo', 'Cinque, Gianfelice', 'Sorio, Claudio']","['Bellisola G', 'Della Peruta M', 'Vezzalini M', 'Moratti E', 'Vaccari L', 'Birarda G', 'Piccinini M', 'Cinque G', 'Sorio C']","['Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Italy. giuseppe.bellisola@univr.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Microscopy/instrumentation/*methods', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/instrumentation/*methods']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/16 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c0an00509f [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2010 Dec;135(12):3077-86. doi: 10.1039/c0an00509f.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is a useful tool for detecting fusion transcripts from common chromosomal translocations of ALL cells. METHODS: Multiplex RT-PCR and nested-PCR assays were used to detect ALL-type BCR-ABL1 transcripts of the t(9;22), TCF-PBX1 transcripts of t(1;19), the MLL-AF4 transcripts of t(4;11), and 2 variants of ETV6-RUNX1 of the cryptic t(12;21) in 148 leukemic samples upon diagnosis. The patients received risk-directed protocols of the Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group-ALL-2002 that consisted of multiple chemotherapeutic agents of different intensities. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed for genetic abnormalities detected by multiplex PCR and conventional cytogenetic analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared with the Mantel-Haenszel test. The Cox proportional hazards model was implemented to identify independent prognostic factors for EFS and OS. RESULTS: In this cohort of Taiwanese children, the relative frequencies of the 4 translocations of B-lineage ALL were 8% with ALL-type t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1, 4% with (1;19)/TCF-PBX1, 2% with t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, and 17.6% with t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1. Patients with t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, hyperdiploidy, and t(1;19)/TCF-PBX1 fusion had the most favorable outcomes, whereas those with the t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1 fusion or t(4;11) and other MLL gene rearrangement had poor prognosis (P<0.001 for EFS and OS). BCR-ABL1, MLL gene rearrangement, and very high-risk group were independent prognostic factors after Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The biological factors of leukemia cells are associated with treatment outcomes in childhood ALL. Multiplex RT-PCR assay is an efficient and sensitive diagnostic tool that may improve the ability to accurately and rapidly risk-stratify children with ALL.","['Yang, Yung-Li', 'Lin, Shu-Rung', 'Chen, Jiann-Shiuh', 'Hsiao, Chih-Cheng', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Sheen, Jiunn-Ming', 'Cheng, Chao-Neng', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Lin, Shu-Wha', 'Yu, Sung-Liang', 'Chen, Hsuan-Yu', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Yen, Ching-Tzu', 'Lin, Jing-Fang', 'Su, Ying-Hui', 'Li, Ya-Ping', 'Lin, Chien-Yu', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn']","['Yang YL', 'Lin SR', 'Chen JS', 'Hsiao CC', 'Lin KH', 'Sheen JM', 'Cheng CN', 'Wu KH', 'Lin SW', 'Yu SL', 'Chen HY', 'Lu MY', 'Chang HH', 'Yen CT', 'Lin JF', 'Su YH', 'Li YP', 'Lin CY', 'Jou ST', 'Lin DT']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimera', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181ed1655 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Nov;32(8):e323-30. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181ed1655.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of kinase activity has, therefore, been considered an attractive anti-cancer therapeutic strategy. The success of targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors has been well documented with BCR-ABL, where imatinib specifically inhibits kinase activity with impressive pharmacological responses in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, the success of kinase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics is being challenged clinically by the emergence of acquired resistance. Most kinase inhibitors available today are ATP-competitive. There have been efforts to develop kinase inhibitors with new modes of action. In this review, we highlight the development of 'allosteric kinase inhibitors' that inhibit kinase activity by binding to a site remote from the active site of the kinase. We focus on recent efforts directed towards BCR-ABL, for which, significant progress has been made to develop allosteric inhibitors with promising therapeutic activity, especially in the context of overcoming clinically acquired resistance mutations to the first generation of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors.","['Hassan, A Quamrul', 'Sharma, Sreenath V', 'Warmuth, Markus']","['Hassan AQ', 'Sharma SV', 'Warmuth M']","['Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. quamrul.hassan@novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100903,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (GNF-2 compound)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/therapeutic use']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['13232 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.18.13232 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Sep 15;9(18):3710-4. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.18.13232.

A quantitative bisulfite-PCR Pyrosequencing method was used to evaluate methylation of Alu, long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) and satellite-alpha (SAT-alpha) sequences in 77 untreated early-stage (Binet A) CLL patients. Peripheral B-cells from 7 healthy donors were used as controls. Methylation levels (median %5mC) were lower in B-CLLs compared with controls (21.4 vs. 25.9; 66.8 vs. 85.7; 84.0, vs. 88.2 for Alu, LINE-1 and SAT-alpha, respectively) (p < 0.001).

Successful sustained weight loss decreases future risk. The relationship of being overweight to the risk for leukemia in the aggregate has been supported in several large cohort studies and two meta-analyses of cohort and case-control studies. One meta-analysis found an elevated risk for each of the four major subtypes of leukemia. A significant association between the risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and elevated BMI was supported by a meta-analysis of 13 cohort and nine case-control studies. The risk for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may be especially significant. A high BMI increases the risk for myeloma, as judged by a meta-analysis of 11 cohort and four case-control studies. The biological relationship of obesity to the risk for cancer (biological plausibility) is unresolved. The two major causal final pathways could be ""inductive"" or ""selective."" The metabolic, endocrinologic, immunologic, and inflammatory-like changes resulting from obesity may increase the cell mutation rate, dysregulate gene function, disturb DNA repair, or induce epigenetic changes, favoring the induction of neoplastic transformation (inductive). Alternatively, obesity may create an environment in which pre-existing clones that are dormant are permitted (selected) to emerge.","['Lichtman, Marshall A']",['Lichtman MA'],"['University of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, New York 14642-0001, USA. mal@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101007,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2010-0206 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0206 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2010;15(10):1083-101. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0206.

Among 525,982 men and women free of cancer at enrollment, we identified 1,129 incident CLL/SLL cases during 11.2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We found no associations between total fat, saturated fat, fiber, red meat, processed meat, fruit, or vegetable intake and risk of CLL/SLL. We noted a suggestive positive association between body mass index and CLL/SLL (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.36). CONCLUSION: We did not find any associations between food or nutrient intake and CLL/SLL.

Similarly, the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins determine lentiviral restriction in a primate host-species specific manner. For example rhesus TRIM5alpha (rhTRIM5alpha) can potently restrict HIV-1 infection while human TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha) only has a mild effect on SIVmac and HIV-1 infectivity (Lv1). Human TRIM5alpha is able to restrict MLV-N virus replication, but is ineffective against MLV-B or MLV-NB virus infection. Lv2 restriction of some HIV-2 viruses is seen in human cells. Like Lv1, Lv2 is a post-entry restriction factor, whose viral determinants have been mapped to the viral capsid (CA). Unlike Lv1, however, Lv2 is determined by envelope (Env) in addition to CA. Here we present evidence of a novel Env determined post entry restriction to infection in human cells of pseudotyped MLV-B and MLV-NB cores. RESULTS: We generated retroviral vectors pseudotyped with various gamma and lentiviral Envs on MLV-B and -NB CAs containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Flow cytometry was used to determine transduction efficiencies in NP2/CD4/CXCR4 (glioma cell line stably transduced with the HIV receptors) and HeLa/CD4 cell lines. The HeLa/CD4 cell line restricted both MLV CAs in an Env dependent manner, compared to NP2/CD4/CXCR4 cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT-PCR) analysis of reverse transcription (RT) transcripts demonstrates that this restriction occurs at a post entry and RT level. siRNA knockdown of huTRIM5alpha ruled out a direct role for this cellular component in mediating this restriction. We describe a previously unobserved Env determined restriction of MLV-B and MLV-NB CAs in HeLa/CD4 cells when pseudotyped with HIV-2 and RD114 Envs, but not gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV), HIV-1 or Amphotrophic (Ampho) Envs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data further demonstrate the variability of Env and CA mediated susceptibility to post entry host cell restriction. We discuss the relevance of these findings in light of the growing evidence supporting the complexities involved in innate host immunity to retroviral infection.","['Oliveira, Nidia M M', 'Trikha, Roochi', 'McKnight, Aine']","['Oliveira NM', 'Trikha R', 'McKnight A']","['HIV/AIDS Group, Centre for Immunology and Infectious Disease, Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, 4 Newark Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'HIV-2/chemistry/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Reassortant Viruses/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Zinc Fingers']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-81 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-81 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Oct 7;7:81. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-81.,['G117/547/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC2959036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoids, through their cognate nuclear receptors, exert potent effects on cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, and have significant promise for cancer therapy and chemoprevention. Differentiation therapy with ATRA has marked a major advance and become the first choice drug in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Conversions of 13-cis-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid to all-trans-retinoic acid is very rapid. Currently, two distinct families of retinoid responsive nuclear receptors have been identified and characterized: retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid receptors (RXRs), each of which include three isoforms, alpha,beta,and gamma. ATRA is being increasingly included in anti-tumour therapeutical schemes for the treatment of various tumoral diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, bladder cancer, neuroblastoma and has shown antiangiogenic effects in several systems, inhibiting proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and anti-inflammatory in rheumatoid arthritis. This review helps to understand in details about the ATRA and its role on cancer and it is predicted that modulating the activity of ATRA will soon provide novel prevention and treatment approaches for the cancer patients.","['Siddikuzzaman', 'Guruvayoorappan, C', 'Berlin Grace, V M']","['Siddikuzzaman', 'Guruvayoorappan C', 'Berlin Grace VM']","['Department of Biotechnology, School of Biotechnology & Health Sciences, Karunya University, Karunya Nagar, Coimbatore - 641 114, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101008,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",2010/10/12 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08923973.2010.521507 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2011 Jun;33(2):241-9. doi: 10.3109/08923973.2010.521507.

20929406,NLM,MEDLINE,20110307,20220114,1557-9077 (Electronic) 1050-7256 (Linking),20,11,2010 Nov,Thyroid dysfunction caused by second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia.,1209-14,10.1089/thy.2010.0251 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Thyroid dysfunction is a well-known adverse effect of first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), like sunitinib. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of second-generation TKIs on thyroid function. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the effect of the first-generation TKI imatinib and the second-generation TKI nilotinib and dasatinib on thyroid function tests in 73 Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) chronic myeloid leukemia patients. RESULTS: Overall, 33 of 73 (45%) had one or more thyroid function test abnormalities during follow-up. Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism were found in 18 of 73 (25%) and 21 of 73 (29%) cases after a median of 6 and 22 weeks, respectively. In most patients (29 of 39, 74%) thyroid dysfunction was transient without clinical symptoms. Therapy of hypo-/hyperthyroidism was required in three patients. Thyroid dysfunction never resulted in the discontinuation of TKI therapy. Under treatment with imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, thyroid abnormalities were detected in 25%, 55%, and 70%, respectively. Four of 55 patients (7%) treated with nilotinib had evidence for an autoimmune thyroiditis (antibody positive in 3 of 4 patients) with an episode of hyperthyroidism preceding hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid dysfunction is a common adverse event with second-generation TKI therapy in patients with Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Although the mechanism is still unclear, the high frequency of thyroid abnormalities, including autoimmune thyroiditis, warrants regular and long-term monitoring of thyroid function in these patients.","['Kim, Theo D', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Nogai, Hendrik', 'Grille, Peggy', 'Westermann, Jorg', 'Plockinger, Ursula', 'Braun, Doreen', 'Schweizer, Ulrich', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'le Coutre, Philipp']","['Kim TD', 'Schwarz M', 'Nogai H', 'Grille P', 'Westermann J', 'Plockinger U', 'Braun D', 'Schweizer U', 'Arnold R', 'Dorken B', 'le Coutre P']","['Clinic for Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. theo.kim@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101007,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thyroid Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Thyroid Function Tests', 'Thyroid Gland/*drug effects']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2010.0251 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2010 Nov;20(11):1209-14. doi: 10.1089/thy.2010.0251.

We undertook a study to ascertain whether any of these two retroviruses were present in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA of New York State subjects deemed at risk for PTLV infection. Samples were analyzed by PTLV-3 and PTLV-4 specific PCR assays from the following human and simian subject types: African-American medical clinic patients; HTLV EIA+, WB indeterminate blood donors; intravenous drug users; patients with leukemia, lymphoma, myelopathy, polymyositis, or AIDS; and African chimpanzees. None of the 1200 subjects was positive for HTLV-3 or 4. The data indicate that, at the time of sample collection, no evidence exists for the dissemination of HTLV-3 or 4 to New York State.

However, resistance is occasionally observed, mainly due to mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain. The T315I substitution confers complete resistance to all TKIs commonly used in clinical practice. To date, the hierarchical level of stem cells in which this mutation initially appears has not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of T315I mutated cells and to study the presence of potential additional mutations in progenitors and stem cells from a patient with CML. A comprehensive analysis of BCR-ABL(315I) mRNA expressing cells in mononuclear cells, in CD34+ cell populations, and in their primitive long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) derived progenitors was performed. We show that the T315I substitution arises in primitive Ph1 stem cells without altering their myeloid and erythroid terminal differentiation potential. Leukemic cells expressing a T315I mutated BCR-ABL display a progressive decline in LTC-IC assays as described for non-mutated CML cells at diagnosis. Finally, in our experiments, additional non-315 ABL mutations were identified in hematopoietic stem cell colonies. This observation is suggestive of genetic instability affecting CML progenitors.","['Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Sorel, Nathalie', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Bertrand, Angelina', 'Brizard, Francoise', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Chomel JC', 'Sorel N', 'Bonnet ML', 'Bertrand A', 'Brizard F', 'Roy L', 'Guilhot F', 'Turhan AG']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Oncologie Biologique, CHU de Poitiers, France. j.c.chomel@chu-poitiers.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Isoleucine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Threonine/genetics']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/10/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.520774 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Nov;51(11):2103-11. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.520774.

In this work we have investigated the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements and mutational status in 80 Uruguayan patients with CLL, and compared these results with those obtained in other geographic regions. Our results demonstrate that Uruguayan patients with CLL display an IGHV gene usage which resembles that observed in Mediterranean countries and exhibits certain differences compared with Brazilian and Asian series, as expected, considering the ethnic basis of the Uruguayan population.

While this is the case, BCR-ABL leukemic stem cells can persist despite TKI therapy, and efforts have intensified towards determining the molecular pathways that are critical for the maintenance of such cells. Recent studies indicate that aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a crucial role in the survival of the leukemic stem cell population. The Hh pathway displays crucial roles during embryonic development, tissue regeneration and repair in adults. Several mechanisms that lead to the aberrant activation of the Hh pathway have been identified in various cancers. Here we review in detail the discovery that Hh signaling governs the maintenance of the critical leukemia initiating cells or leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in BCR-ABL-induced CML as well as discuss investigations on the role of Hh signaling in normal hematopoeisis. As inhibitors that directly target the positive Hh signal transducer Smoothened (SMO) have entered clinical trials, these findings offer a unique opportunity to potentially target the LSC population that is not eliminated with ABL tyrosine kinase inhibition therapy in CML.","['Jagani, Zainab', 'Dorsch, Marion', 'Warmuth, Markus']","['Jagani Z', 'Dorsch M', 'Warmuth M']","['Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/cc.9.17.12945 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Sep 1;9(17):3449-56. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.17.12945.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, the deoxyribonucleoside analog 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) did not have a similar effect on survival in a large clinical trial. Both drugs are thought to exert their effects after incorporation into DNA by covalent binding of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). While 5-Aza-CdR is incorporated into only DNA, 5-Aza-CR is also incorporated into RNA. Here, we have analyzed whether this difference in nucleic acid incorporation may influence the capacities of these drugs to regulate the expression of mRNA and microRNAs (miRNA), which may potentially affect the activities of the drugs in patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A hematopoietic (HL-60; acute myeloid leukemia) and a solid (T24; transitional cell carcinoma) cancer cell line were treated with equitoxic doses of 5-Aza-CR and 5-Aza-CdR for 24 hrs, and the immediate (day 2) and lasting (day 8) effects on RNA expression examined. There was considerable overlap between the RNAs heritably upregulated by both drugs on day 8 but more RNAs were stably induced by the deoxy analog. Both drugs strongly induced expression of cancer testis antigens. On day 2 more RNAs were downregulated by 5-Aza-CR, particularly at higher doses. A remarkable downregulation of miRNAs and a significant upregulation of tRNA synthetases and other genes involved in amino acid metabolism was observed in T24 cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, this suggests that significant differences exist in the immediate action of the two drugs, however the dominant pattern of the lasting, and possible heritable changes, is overlapping.","['Qiu, Xiangning', 'Hother, Christoffer', 'Ralfkiaer, Ulrik M', 'Sogaard, Alexandra', 'Lu, Qianjin', 'Workman, Christopher T', 'Liang, Gangning', 'Jones, Peter A', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Qiu X', 'Hother C', 'Ralfkiaer UM', 'Sogaard A', 'Lu Q', 'Workman CT', 'Liang G', 'Jones PA', 'Gronbaek K']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100929,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Decitabine', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012994 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Sep 29;5(9). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012994.,"['R01 CA1378794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA82422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA082422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2947512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that Mnks can phosphorylate eIF4E. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a tumor suppressor, and it was previously suggested to regulate eIF4E phosphorylation. However, how PP2A regulates eIF4E phosphorylation has not been fully addressed. In this study, we have not only validated the role of PP2A in regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation but also demonstrated the mechanism underlying this process. Inhibition of PP2A using either okadaic acid or PP2A small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased eIF4E phosphorylation, which could be abolished by the presence of the Mnk inhibitor CGP57380 or deficiency of Mnk genes. Thus, Mnks are involved in PP2A-mediated regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation. Moreover, a dephosphorylation assay revealed that PP2A could directly dephosphorylate Mnk1 and eIF4E. m(7)GTP pull-down assay detected more eIF4G and phospho-eIF4E and less 4EBP-1 in PP2A siRNA-transfected cells than in control siRNA-transfected cells, indicating an increased cap binding of eIF4F complex. Accordingly, okadaic acid treatment or PP2A knockdown increased the levels of c-Myc and Mcl-1, which are proteins known to be regulated by a cap-dependent translation mechanism. Taken together, we conclude that PP2A negatively regulates eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF4F complex assembly through dephosphorylation of Mnk and eIF4E, thus suggesting a novel mechanism by which PP2A exerts its tumor-suppressive function.","['Li, Yikun', 'Yue, Ping', 'Deng, Xingming', 'Ueda, Takeshi', 'Fukunaga, Rikiro', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Sun, Shi-Yong']","['Li Y', 'Yue P', 'Deng X', 'Ueda T', 'Fukunaga R', 'Khuri FR', 'Sun SY']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Eif4ebp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mknk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mknk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F/genetics/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.10704 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2010 Oct;12(10):848-55. doi: 10.1593/neo.10704.,"['P01 CA116676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2950334,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical implication of CEBPA hypermethylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. To investigate the correlation between CEBPA hypermethylation and clinical features in AML, quantitative MassARRAY analyses for CEBPA methylation status were performed on a cohort of 193 patients. High CEBPA methylation group (CEBPA(high-meth), n=28) and low methylation group (CEBPA(low-meth), n=165) were defined by using two-way hierarchical clustering. With a median follow-up of 48 months, among the 125 patients receiving standard induction therapy, CEBPA(high-meth) was associated with better treatment response (complete remission rate 93.3% versus 73.6%, P=0.116). In patients with normal karyotype and without CEBPA and NPM1 mutations, the CEBPA(high-meth) had longer overall survival (OS) than the CEBPA(low-meth) (P=0.028). Multivariate analysis further supported that the CEBPA methylation was an independent prognostic factor for disease free-survival (hazard ratio=0.416; 95% confidence interval, 0.223-0.777, P=0.006) and OS (hazard ratio=0.406; 95% confidence interval, 0.166-0.996, P=0.050).

However, the role of autophagy in leukemia still remains largely unknown. Here we show that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the best characterized damage-associated molecular pattern, was released from leukemia cell lines after chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity and activated autophagy to protect against injury. Treatment with HMGB1-neutralizing antibodies increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy; whereas, exogenous HMGB1 rendered these cells more resistant to drug-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, exogenous HMGB1 increased autophagy as evaluated by increased expression of the autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, degradation of sequestosome 1 (p62) and autophagosome formation. Furthermore, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of either phosphoinositide 3-kinase-III or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase inhibited HMGB1-induced autophagy. Taken together, these results suggest that HMGB1 release after chemotherapy is a critical regulator of autophagy and a potential drug target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia.","['Liu, L', 'Yang, M', 'Kang, R', 'Wang, Z', 'Zhao, Y', 'Yu, Y', 'Xie, M', 'Yin, X', 'Livesey, K M', 'Lotze, M T', 'Tang, D', 'Cao, L']","['Liu L', 'Yang M', 'Kang R', 'Wang Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Yu Y', 'Xie M', 'Yin X', 'Livesey KM', 'Lotze MT', 'Tang D', 'Cao L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['*Autophagy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HMGB1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010225 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.225 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Jan;25(1):23-31. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.225.

Here, we examined its role in zebrafish hematopoiesis based on pharmacological inhibition and morpholino (MO) knockdown. Zebrafish embryos were treated with diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB, 1 mumol/l) between 0- and 48 hour-post-fertilization (hpf). MOs targeting aldhs were injected between 1 and 4-cell stage. The effects on hematopoiesis were evaluated at different stages. DEAB treatment between 0 and 18 hpf increased gene expression associated with HSPC (scl, lmo2), erythropoiesis (gata1, alpha- and beta-eHb) and myelopoiesis (spi1) as well as gfp(+) cells in dissociated Tg(gata1:gfp) embryos. The effects were ameliorated by all-trans retinoic acid (1 nmol/l). Definitive hematopoiesis and the erythromyeloid precursors were unaffected. In all, 14 out of 15 zebrafish aldhs were detectable by reverse transcription PCR in 18 hpf embryos, of which only aldh1a2 and aldh16a1 were expressed in sites pertinent to hematopoiesis. Molecular targeting by MOs was demonstrated for 15 aldhs, but none of them, even in combined aldh1a2 and aldh1a3 knockdown, recapitulated the hematopoietic expansion in DEAB-treated embryos. In conclusion, DEAB expands HSPC population during primitive hematopoiesis through inhibition of aldh and retinoic acid synthesis. The specific aldh isoform(s) remains to be determined.","['Ma, A C H', 'Chung, M I S', 'Liang, R', 'Leung, A Y H']","['Ma AC', 'Chung MI', 'Liang R', 'Leung AY']","['Division of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Zebrafish/*embryology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010206 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.206 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Dec;24(12):2090-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.206.

However, Fas expressing human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Since the implanting embryo secretes FasL, we examined whether Fas mediates non-apoptotic effects in human ESCs in vitro. ESCs were isolated from hysterectomy specimens, decidualized using progesterone and 17beta-estradiol and incubated with an activating anti-Fas antibody, recombinant FasL and a caspase-inhibitor. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin (IL)-11, -6, -8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and RANTES (Regulated on Activation Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted) were measured using ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. Viability of ESCs was determined using an MTT assay. Caspase-activity was measured by luminescent assays. Activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB was detected by in-cell western and transcription factor assays. LIF and IL-11 in undifferentiated and IL-8 in decidualized ESCs were up-regulated by non-apoptotic Fas-signaling. In contrast, IL-6, MCP-1 and RANTES were not regulated by Fas. Caspases were activated upon Fas-stimulation and the Fas-mediated effects on LIF, IL-11 and -8 were reversed by caspase-inhibition. The transcription factor NF-kappaB was not activated in ESCs after stimulation of Fas. These results suggest a differential regulatory role of caspase-dependent Fas-signaling at the feto-maternal interface during early implantation. Remarkably, this typical death machinery mediates non-apoptotic effects in the human endometrium rather than inducing apoptosis.","['Fluhr, Herbert', 'Wenig, Henriette', 'Spratte, Julia', 'Heidrich, Stephanie', 'Ehrhardt, Jens', 'Zygmunt, Marek']","['Fluhr H', 'Wenig H', 'Spratte J', 'Heidrich S', 'Ehrhardt J', 'Zygmunt M']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. herbert.fluhr@uni-greifswald.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101006,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*immunology/metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['gaq082 [pii]', '10.1093/molehr/gaq082 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2011 Feb;17(2):127-34. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gaq082.

In this study, we investigated the biological functions of Clld7 protein in inducible osteosarcoma cell lines. Clld7 induction inhibited cell growth, decreased cell viability, and increased gamma-H2AX staining under conditions of caspase inhibition, indicating activation of the DNA damage/repair pathway. Real-time PCR analysis in tumor cells and normal human epithelial cells revealed Clld7 target genes that regulate DNA repair responses.

SHRs pass signals from a steroid/hormone to the target genes by interacting with specific response element DNA sequences and various coregulatory proteins that consists of activators and/or corepressors. Disruptions in physiological functions of SHRs leads to several types of malignancies such as breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer among others. Steroids/hormones/SHRs and their coregulators have opened up a unique window for novel steroid-based targeted therapies for cancer. Thus, dysregulation of SHR signaling in cancers compared with normal tissues can be exploited to target drugs that prevent and treat human cancers. In recent years, hormonal therapy has made a major contribution to the treatment of several cancers including reduced recurrence rates and longer survival rates. Development of various steroid receptor modulators and their potential therapeutic efficacies has provided us a great opportunity to effectively manage diseases like cancer in future. In this review article, we have summarized up-to-date knowledge of the role of SHRs in the development and progression of cancers, and potential endocrine-based therapeutic approaches to tackle these diseases.","['Ahmad, Nihal', 'Kumar, Raj']","['Ahmad N', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/etiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Receptors, Androgen/physiology', 'Receptors, Progesterone/physiology', 'Receptors, Steroid/*physiology']",2010/10/12 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(10)00431-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2010.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2011 Jan 1;300(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2010.09.008.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Athymic nude mice implanted with BEL-7402 cells were given celecoxib and fluvastatin, either alone or in combination, and the effect of treatment on tumour growth was evaluated after 6 weeks. The combination of celecoxib and fluvastatin enhanced inhibition of tumour growth, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of tumour cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumour angiogenesis compared with either treatment alone. The combination of celecoxib and fluvastatin also increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1), decreased levels of p-Akt, myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin protein, but had no effect on Akt protein levels in tumours.

Conditioning with t-IV Bu/Flu reduced early toxicity including idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Additionally, the trajectory of early NRM (100 day: 16% vs. 3%, and1 year: 25% vs. 15% for Bu/Cy and t-IV Bu/Flu, respectively) favored t-IV Bu/Flu.

Pharmacokinetic targeting of intravenous busulfan in combination with fludarabine is associated with reduced conditioning regimen related toxicity compared to oral busulfan and cyclophosphamide.

Recently, we developed software Isodyn, which extends the methodology of kinetic modeling to the analysis of isotopic isomer distribution for the evaluation of cellular metabolic flux profile under relevant conditions. This tool can be applied to reveal the metabolic effect of proapoptotic drug edelfosine in leukemia Jurkat cell line, uncovering the mechanisms of induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. RESULTS: The study of 13C distribution of Jukat cells exposed to low edelfosine concentration, which induces apoptosis in </=5% of cells, revealed metabolic changes previous to the development of apoptotic program. Specifically, it was found that low dose of edelfosine stimulates the TCA cycle. These metabolic perturbations were coupled with an increase of nucleic acid synthesis de novo, which indicates acceleration of biosynthetic and reparative processes. The further increase of the TCA cycle fluxes, when higher doses of drug applied, eventually enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and trigger apoptotic program. CONCLUSION: The application of Isodyn to the analysis of mechanism of edelfosine-induced apoptosis revealed primary drug-induced metabolic changes, which are important for the subsequent initiation of apoptotic program. Initiation of such metabolic changes could be exploited in anticancer therapy.","['Selivanov, Vitaly A', 'Vizan, Pedro', 'Mollinedo, Faustino', 'Fan, Teresa W M', 'Lee, Paul W N', 'Cascante, Marta']","['Selivanov VA', 'Vizan P', 'Mollinedo F', 'Fan TW', 'Lee PW', 'Cascante M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, Institute of Biomedicine of University of Barcelona (IBUB) and IDIBAPS, Unit Associated with CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101006,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isotopes)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isotopes', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/02/16 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-4-135 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-4-135 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2010 Oct 6;4:135. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-4-135.,"['1R01CA101199-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA118434-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR00425-33/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AT003960-01/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2984393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large-scale screenings of multiple types of molecular aberrations (e.g., mutations, copy number variations, DNA methylations, gene expressions) become increasingly important in the prognosis and study of cancer. Consequently, a computational model integrating multiple types of information is essential for the analysis of the comprehensive data. RESULTS: We propose an integrated modeling framework to identify the statistical and putative causal relations of various molecular aberrations and gene expressions in cancer. To reduce spurious associations among the massive number of probed features, we sequentially applied three layers of logistic regression models with increasing complexity and uncertainty regarding the possible mechanisms connecting molecular aberrations and gene expressions. Layer 1 models associate gene expressions with the molecular aberrations on the same loci. Layer 2 models associate expressions with the aberrations on different loci but have known mechanistic links. Layer 3 models associate expressions with nonlocal aberrations which have unknown mechanistic links. We applied the layered models to the integrated datasets of NCI-60 cancer cell lines and validated the results with large-scale statistical analysis. Furthermore, we discovered/reaffirmed the following prominent links: (1) Protein expressions are generally consistent with mRNA expressions. (2) Several gene expressions are modulated by composite local aberrations. For instance, CDKN2A expressions are repressed by either frame-shift mutations or DNA methylations. (3) Amplification of chromosome 6q in leukemia elevates the expression of MYB, and the downstream targets of MYB on other chromosomes are up-regulated accordingly. (4) Amplification of chromosome 3p and hypo-methylation of PAX3 together elevate MITF expression in melanoma, which up-regulates the downstream targets of MITF. (5)Mutations of TP53 are negatively associated with its direct target genes. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis results on NCI-60 data justify the utility of the layered models for the incoming flow of cancer genomic data. Experimental validations on selected prominent links and application of the layered modeling framework to other integrated datasets will be carried out subsequently.","['Yeang, Chen-Hsiang']",['Yeang CH'],"['Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. chyeang@webmail.stat.sinica.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101006,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'DNA Methylation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'United States']",2010/10/12 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2010/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-495 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-495 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Oct 6;11:495. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-495.,,PMC2984587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High efficient surveying of whole genome DNA methylation has been aims of many researchers for long. Recently, the rapidly developed massively parallel DNA-sequencing technologies open the floodgates to vast volumes of sequence data, enabling a paradigm shift in profiling the whole genome methylation. Here, we describe a strategy, combining methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing with peak search to identify methylated regions on a whole-genome scale. Massively parallel methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing combined with methylation DNA immunoprecipitation was adopted to obtain methylated DNA sequence data from human leukemia cell line K562, and the methylated regions were identified by peak search based on Poison model. From our result, 140 958 non-overlapping methylated regions have been identified in the whole genome. Also, the credibility of result has been proved by its strong correlation with bisulfite-sequencing data (Pearson R(2)=0.92). It suggests that this method provides a reliable and high-throughput strategy for whole genome methylation identification.","['Yang, Yao', 'Wang, Wei', 'Li, Yanqiang', 'Tu, Jing', 'Bai, Yunfei', 'Xiao, Pengfeng', 'Zhang, Dingdong', 'Lu, Zuhong']","['Yang Y', 'Wang W', 'Li Y', 'Tu J', 'Bai Y', 'Xiao P', 'Zhang D', 'Lu Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,"['0 (Sulfites)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Sulfites']",2010/10/07 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/elps.201000326 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2010 Oct;31(21):3537-44. doi: 10.1002/elps.201000326.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive research within the last decade in cell culture and in rodents has revealed that curcumin can sensitize tumors to different chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, vincristine, melphalan, butyrate, cisplatin, celecoxib, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, etoposide, sulfinosine, thalidomide, and bortezomib. Chemosensitization has been observed in cancers of the breast, colon, pancreas, gastric, liver, blood, lung, prostate, bladder, cervix, ovary, head and neck, and brain and in multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Similar studies have also revealed that this agent can sensitize a variety of tumors to gamma radiation including glioma, neuroblastoma, cervical carcinoma, epidermal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. How curcumin acts as a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer has also been studied extensively. For example, it downregulates various growth regulatory pathways and specific genetic targets including genes for NF-kappaB, STAT3, COX2, Akt, antiapoptotic proteins, growth factor receptors, and multidrug-resistance proteins. Although it acts as a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer for tumors in some cases, curcumin has also been shown to protect normal organs such as liver, kidney, oral mucosa, and heart from chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced toxicity. The protective effects of curcumin appear to be mediated through its ability to induce the activation of NRF2 and induce the expression of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., hemeoxygenase-1, glutathione peroxidase, modulatory subunit of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, increase glutathione (a product of the modulatory subunit of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase), directly quench free radicals, and inhibit p300 HAT activity.

In this study, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements (V(H)D(H)J(H) region) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Point mutations of the D835/I836 in the activation loop (AL) domain of the second tyrosine kinase domain of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene and NRAS (neuroblastoma cell line) point mutations were also analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the V(H)D(H)J(H) region was performed, as well as, chromosomal aberrations were identified by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) in a 12.5-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Positive MRD was found in bone marrow samples obtained at various time points during and after treatment completion prior to relapse. Molecular analysis of the FLT3 gene mutations revealed an acquired a G --> T mutation at codon 835, which resulted to substitution of aspartate 835 for tyrosine (D835Y). Cytogenetic analysis with iFISH showed t(9;22) (q34;q11.2), with minor-BCR/ABL1 fusion gene in the majority of nuclei, while a subclone with duplication of the Philadelphia chromosome was observed. Triple signals of AML1 were detected in 80% of nuclei, which were compatible with trisomy of chromosome 21. BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, duplication of Philadelphia chromosome and persistence of MRD constitute inferior prognostic factors, while hyperdiploidy, trisomy of chromosome 21 and FLT3-AL mutations are related to better prognosis. The study of cytogenetic and molecular characteristics is essential in order to decide on the optimal treatment protocol in childhood leukemia.","['Katsibardi, Katerina', 'Braoudaki, Maria', 'Papadhimitriou, Stefanos I', 'Karamolegou, Kalliopi', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, Fotini']","['Katsibardi K', 'Braoudaki M', 'Papadhimitriou SI', 'Karamolegou K', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F']","[""Hematology/Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Thivon & Levadias, 11527 Goudi-Athens, Greece. katharinakats@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101007,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Duplication', 'Down Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/*genetics']",2010/10/07 06:00,2012/08/23 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9689-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28 Suppl 1:S501-4. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9689-7.

In our previous report, we have revealed that miR-196b was significantly down-regulated in both EB-3 cells as well as B-cell ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) patients as compared to their respective controls. We have unambiguously proven that miR-196b restoration in EB-3 cells leads to significant down-regulation of c-myc and its effector genes, i.e., human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), and qualifies for tumor suppressor function in B-cell ALL. Keeping in view these results, the present study was aimed at dissecting the role of miR-196b and other miRNAs present near/within the genomic regions involved in genetic translocations characteristic of ALL in T-cell ALL cell lines and patient samples. We have demonstrated significant down-regulation in the expression of miR-196b in MOLT-4 and T-cell ALL patients with respect to the respective control cells. Transfection experiments revealed that none of the six identified miRNAs were able to knock down the expression of c-myc gene. Interestingly, it was found that miR-196b loses its ability to down-regulate c-myc gene expression in T-cell ALL as a consequence of mutations in target 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the c-myc gene. Results of the present study revealed that miR-196b becomes non-functional in T-cell ALL as a consequence of mutations in 3'-UTR of c-myc gene in T-cell ALL cellular models.","['Bhatia, Suman', 'Kaul, Deepak', 'Varma, Neelam']","['Bhatia S', 'Kaul D', 'Varma N']","['Molecular Biology Unit, Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101006,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MIRN196 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2010/10/07 06:00,2011/04/09 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-010-0597-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2011 Jan;346(1-2):103-16. doi: 10.1007/s11010-010-0597-0.

Riccardin D had a significant antiproliferative effect on human leukemia cell lines HL-60, K562 and its multidrug resistant (MDR) counterpart K562/A02 cells, but showed no effect on the topoisomerase-II-deficient HL-60/MX2 cells, as measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The pBR322 DNA relaxation assay revealed that riccardin D selectively inhibited the activity of topoisomerase II (topo II). The suppression of topo II activity by riccardin D was stronger than that of etoposide, a known topo II inhibitor. After treatment with riccardin D, nuclear extracts of leukemia K562 and K562/A02 cells left the majority of pBR322 DNA in a supercoiled form. Further examination showed that riccardin D effectively induced HL-60, K562 and K562/A02 apoptosis as evidenced by externalization of phosphatidylserine and formation of DNA ladder fragments. The activation of cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) was also enhanced, as estimated by Western blot analysis. By contrast, riccardin D was unable to induce apoptosis in the topoisomerase-II-deficient HL-60/MX2 cells, indicating that the induction of apoptosis by riccardin D was due to the inhibition of topo II activity. In addition, riccardin D was able to significantly decrease P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in K562/A02 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that riccardin D is a novel DNA topo II inhibitor which can induce apoptosis of human leukemia cells and that it has therapeutic potential for both regular and MDR strains of leukemia cells.","['Xue, Xia', 'Qu, Xian-Jun', 'Gao, Zu-Hua', 'Sun, Cui-Cui', 'Liu, Hui-Ping', 'Zhao, Cui-Rong', 'Cheng, Yan-Na', 'Lou, Hong-Xiang']","['Xue X', 'Qu XJ', 'Gao ZH', 'Sun CC', 'Liu HP', 'Zhao CR', 'Cheng YN', 'Lou HX']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101006,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Phenyl Ethers)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (riccardin D)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phenyl Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2010/10/07 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9554-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Feb;30(1):212-22. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9554-8.

METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether combining the nucleoside analogue sapacitabine with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors could be an effective treatment. Synergy and mode-of-action analysis were studied in cultured cell lines and the efficacy of the combination was confirmed in a xenograft model. RESULTS: CNDAC (1-(2-C-cyano-2-deoxy-beta-D-arabino-pentofuranosyl)-cytosine), the active component of sapacitabine, synergised with vorinostat in cell lines derived from a range of tumour types. Synergy was not dependent on a specific sequence of drug administration and was also observed when CNDAC was combined with an alternative HDAC inhibitor, valproate. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis confirmed that the combination induced a significant increase in apoptosis. Mode-of-action analysis detected changes in Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, Noxa, Bid and Bim, which are all regulators of the apoptotic process. The sapacitabine/vorinostat combination demonstrated significant benefit compared with the single-agent treatments in an MV4-11 xenograft, in the absence of any observed toxicity. CONCLUSION: Sapacitabine and HDAC inhibitors are an effective drug combination that is worthy of clinical exploration.","['Green, S R', 'Choudhary, A K', 'Fleming, I N']","['Green SR', 'Choudhary AK', 'Fleming IN']","['Cyclacel Ltd., 1 James Lindsay Place, Dundee DD1 5JJ, UK. sgreen@cyclacel.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101005,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'W335P73C3L (sapacitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/10/07 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['6605922 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605922 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Oct 26;103(9):1391-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605922.

The efficacy of aflibercept alone and in combination with doxorubicin was evaluated in human VEGF-expressing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary cells xenotransplanted into immunodeficient mice. Aflibercept reduced primary VEGF/VEGFR-positive AML colony formation growth in vitro and inhibited AML xenograft growth up to 93% in association with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects, hypoxia, and VEGF sequestration in multiple models. High VEGF-A expression by AML cells promoted in vivo xenograft growth and aflibercept sensitivity. Aflibercept therapy slowed disease progression in two systemic human AML xenograft models and reduced peripheral leukemia disease in a primary relapsed AML model in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgammanull mice. Combination aflibercept and doxorubicin enhanced antitumor effects in local xenograft models. Sequential aflibercept followed by doxorubicin resulted in progressive anthracycline accumulation in marrow and extramedullary AML sites and resulted in 2-fold higher drug levels 24 hours after administration. In contrast, tissues (tumor, plasma, marrow) treated with chemotherapy only showed progressive drug clearance over time. Combination aflibercept and doxorubicin also resulted in vascular narrowing, decreased vessel number, and perivascular apoptosis. These data suggest that inefficient drug delivery by leukemia-associated vasculature may mediate chemoresistance and support further clinical evaluation of combination aflibercept and anthracycline therapy in refractory/relapsed AML patients.","['Lal, Deepika', 'Park, Jennifer A', 'Demock, Kellie', 'Marinaro, Joseph', 'Perez, Amanda M', 'Lin, Mei-Hui', 'Tian, Lili', 'Mashtare, Terry J', 'Murphy, Michael', 'Prey, Joshua', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Fetterly, Gerald J', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Lal D', 'Park JA', 'Demock K', 'Marinaro J', 'Perez AM', 'Lin MH', 'Tian L', 'Mashtare TJ', 'Murphy M', 'Prey J', 'Wetzler M', 'Fetterly GJ', 'Wang ES']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, and SUNY-UB, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101005,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '15C2VL427D (aflibercept)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2010/10/07 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0334 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0334 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Oct;9(10):2737-51. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0334.

To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological effects, C/EBPalpha-regulated genes were identified by microarray analysis in 32D-p210BCR/ABL cells. One of the genes whose expression was activated by C/EBPalpha in a DNA binding-dependent manner in BCR/ABL-expressing cells is the transcriptional repressor Gfi-1. We show here that C/EBPalpha interacts with a functional C/EBP binding site in the Gfi-1 5'-flanking region and enhances the promoter activity of Gfi-1. Moreover, in K562 cells, RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Gfi-1 expression partially rescued the proliferation-inhibitory but not the differentiation-inducing effect of C/EBPalpha. Ectopic expression of wild-type Gfi-1, but not of a transcriptional repressor mutant (Gfi-1P2A), inhibited proliferation and markedly suppressed colony formation but did not induce granulocytic differentiation of BCR/ABL-expressing cells. By contrast, Gfi-1 short hairpin RNA-tranduced CD34(+) chronic myeloid leukemia cells were markedly more clonogenic than the scramble-transduced counterpart. Together, these studies indicate that Gfi-1 is a direct target of C/EBPalpha required for its proliferation and survival-inhibitory effects in BCR/ABL-expressing cells.","['Lidonnici, Maria Rosa', 'Audia, Alessandra', 'Soliera, Angela Rachele', 'Prisco, Marco', 'Ferrari-Amorotti, Giovanna', 'Waldron, Todd', 'Donato, Nick', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Martinez, Robert V', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Lidonnici MR', 'Audia A', 'Soliera AR', 'Prisco M', 'Ferrari-Amorotti G', 'Waldron T', 'Donato N', 'Zhang Y', 'Martinez RV', 'Holyoake TL', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101005,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Inverted Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2010/10/07 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1667 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1667 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Oct 15;70(20):7949-59. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1667.

TES2 principally activates canonical NF-kappaB, which we confirm is NF-kappaB essential modifier (NEMO)-dependent and requires an intact ubiquitin binding in A20 binding inhibitor of NF-kappaB and NEMO (UBAN) domain. LMP1 TES2 activated NF-kappaB in Jurkat cell lines harboring NEMO truncated at 372 (A45) or NEMO with an in-frame deletion of 133-224 (2C), whereas TNFalpha, 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, human T-cell leukemia virus 1 Tax, and CD40 did not. In both A45 and 2C Jurkat cell lines, LMP1 TES2-mediated NF-kappaB activation was blocked by siRNAs to TNFalpha receptor-associated factor 6 and NEMO, by IkappaB kinase inhibitors, and by the IkappaBalpha superrepressor, indicating that the NEMO mutants function to support canonical NF-kappaB activation. Expression of A45 or 2C mutants in NEMO-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts reproduced the Jurkat phenotypes: LMP1 TES2 activated NF-kappaB in fibroblasts lacking NEMO amino acids 133-224 or 373-419, but TNFalpha and Tax did not. Further analysis indicated that TES2 did not activate NF-kappaB in cells expressing the double deletion mutant Delta133-224/Delta372-419.

Conversely, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), LRF inhibition causes aberrant p19ARF up-regulation resulting in proliferative defects and premature senescence. We have recently shown that LRF is controlled by microRNAs. Here we show that LRF acts on MEF proliferation and senescence/apoptosis by repressing miR-28 and miR-505, revealing a regulatory circuit where microRNAs (miRNAs) work both upstream and downstream of LRF. By analyzing miRNA expression profiles of MEF transfected with LRF-specific short interfering RNAs, we found that miR-28 and miR-505 are modulated by LRF. Both miRNAs are predicted to target alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2), a serine/arginine protein essential for cell viability. In vertebrates, loss or inactivation of ASF/SF2 may result in genomic instability and induce G(2) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We showed that miR-28 and miR-505 modulate ASF/SF2 by directly binding ASF/SF2 3'-UTR. Decrease in LRF causes a decrease in ASF/SF2, which depends on up-regulation of miR-28 and miR-505. Alteration of each of the members of the LRF/miR-28/miR-505/ASF/SF2 axis affects MEF proliferation and the number of senescent and apoptotic cells. Consistently, the axis is coordinately modulated as cell senescence increases with passages in MEF culture. In conclusion, we show that LRF-dependent miRNAs miR-28 and miR-505 control MEF proliferation and survival by targeting ASF/SF2 and suggest a central role of LRF-related miRNAs, in addition to the role of LRF-dependent p53 control, in cellular homeostasis.","['Verduci, Lorena', 'Simili, Marcella', 'Rizzo, Milena', 'Mercatanti, Alberto', 'Evangelista, Monica', 'Mariani, Laura', 'Rainaldi, Giuseppe', 'Pitto, Letizia']","['Verduci L', 'Simili M', 'Rizzo M', 'Mercatanti A', 'Evangelista M', 'Mariani L', 'Rainaldi G', 'Pitto L']","['Laboratory of Gene and Molecular Therapy, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, 56124 Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)', '0 (Zbtb7a protein, mouse)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", '*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cellular Senescence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2010/10/07 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)60651-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.114736 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Dec 10;285(50):39551-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.114736.

In analogy with gene expression profiling, we have previously proposed an original method to identify the immunophenotypic signature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) subsets with different prognosis, named surface-antigen expression profiling. According to this method, expression data for surface markers can be successfully analyzed by data mining tools identical to those employed in gene expression profiling studies, including unsupervised and supervised algorithms, with the aim to identify the immunophenotypic signature of CLL subsets with different prognosis. By employing an identical approach for investigating the reactivity of a wide panel of monoclonal antibodies provided by the ""Ninth International Workshop on Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens"", we were able to identify some of them (i.e. TCL1, CCR7, FCRL2, FCRL3, and CD150) as additional potential markers with prognostic relevance in CLL. These suggestions need to be confirmed: (i) in a new set of clinically characterized CLL cases; (ii) in combination with other prognostic markers in the context of comprehensive scoring systems for clinical outcome prediction.","['Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Cattarossi, Ilaria', 'Nanni, Paola', 'Zaina, Eva', 'Prato, Giuseppina', 'Gilestro, Milena', 'Marconi, Daniela', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Rossi, Francesca M', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi', 'Omede, Paola', 'Geuna, Massimo', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Zucchetto A', 'Cattarossi I', 'Nanni P', 'Zaina E', 'Prato G', 'Gilestro M', 'Marconi D', 'Bulian P', 'Rossi FM', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Omede P', 'Geuna M', 'Del Poeta G', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Hematology Research Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Via Franco Gallini 2, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101013,Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/immunology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation']",2010/10/07 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2478(10)00253-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2010.09.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2011 Jan 30;134(2):137-44. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2010.09.017.

However, only scant information exists on the effect of Candida colonization on serum levels of diagnostic biomarkers. This prospective surveillance study determined the extent of Candida colonization among pediatric cancer patients and its possible impact on serum levels of (1-3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG), Candida mannan and Candida DNA. METHODS: A total of 1075 swabs originating from oropharynx (n = 294), nostrils (n = 600), rectum (n = 28), groin (n = 50), ear (n = 54), and axilla (n = 49) of 63 pediatric cancer patients were cultured for the isolation of Candida spp. Patients yielding Candida spp. from any sites were considered as colonized. Serum samples were collected from patients at the time of first surveillance culture for detection of BDG by Fungitell kit and Candida mannan by Platelia Candida Ag. Candida DNA was detected by using panfungal primers and identification was carried out by using species-specific primers and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Seventy-five (7.6%) swab cultures from 35 (55.5%) patients yielded Candida spp. These isolates included C. albicans (n = 62), C. dubliniensis (n = 8), C. glabrata and C. tropicalis (n = 2 each) and C. krusei (n = 1). Eleven patients were colonized at three or more sites. Eight of 36 serum samples from 6 colonized patients yielded BDG values higher than the currently recommended cut-off value of >/=80 pg/ml. However, none of the serum samples yielded Candida mannan levels >/=0.5 ng/ml and PCR test for Candida DNA was also negative in all the serum samples of colonized patients. During the study period, only two colonized patients subsequently developed candidemia due to C. tropicalis. Besides positive blood cultures, C. tropicalis DNA, BDG and Candida mannan were also detected in serum samples of both the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that while mucosal colonization with Candida species in pediatric cancer patients is common, it does not give rise to diagnostically significant levels of Candida mannan or Candida DNA in serum specimens. However, BDG values may be higher than the cut-off value in some pediatric patients without clinical evidence of invasive Candida infection. The study suggests the utility of Candida mannan or Candida DNA in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, however, the BDG levels in pediatric cancer subjects should be interpreted with caution.","['Mokaddas, Eiman', 'Burhamah, Mona H A', 'Khan, Zia U', 'Ahmad, Suhail']","['Mokaddas E', 'Burhamah MH', 'Khan ZU', 'Ahmad S']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Safat, Kuwait. e.mokaddas@hsc.edu.kw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101006,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal Spacer)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Candida/classification/isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Fungal/*blood', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Mannans/*blood', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteoglycans', 'beta-Glucans/*blood']",2010/10/07 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-10-292 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-10-292 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2010 Oct 6;10:292. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-10-292.,,PMC2988795,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many years, the treatment of ET, PV, and PMF, the most frequently diagnosed Ph-negative MPNs, has been largely supportive. In recent years, that paradigm has been challenged because of the discovery of a recurrent point mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene (JAK2(V617F)). This mutation can be detected in the vast majority of patients with PV and approximately half of patients with ET or PMF and serves as both a diagnostic marker as well as representing a putative molecular target for drug development. Several putative targeted agents with significant in vitro JAK2 inhibitory activity and various degrees of JAK2 specificity are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Furthermore, other investigational non-tyrosine kinase inhibitor approaches such as immunomodulatory agents and pegylated interferon- have also shown promising results in MPNs.","['Agrawal, Meetu', 'Garg, Ravin J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso']","['Agrawal M', 'Garg RJ', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Verstovsek S', 'Quintas-Cardama A']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Unfortunately, there is currently no standard definition of intolerance to imatinib. Common Toxicity Criteria for grading adverse events, designed to identify acute toxicities, are often used to determine intolerance. However, because CML therapies are long-term, patient quality of life may provide a better measure of true intolerance. Several general methods of quantifying patient quality of life are in use for patients with CML, and a CML-specific variant of the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory is in development. An appropriate and consistent definition of intolerance will provide clinicians with an algorithm for managing their patients with severe or chronic adverse events during treatment with imatinib. As more long-term data become available for newer TKIs, the definition of intolerance in the context of CML treatment will continue to evolve to maximize the likelihood of durable responses and superior quality of life for patients.","['Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Mauro, Michael J']","['Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Cortes J', 'Mauro MJ']","['Malignant Hematology Division, H.

PROCEDURES: In vitro cytotoxicity testing employs a semi-automated fluorescence-based digital imaging cytotoxicity assay (DIMSCAN) that has a 4-log dynamic range of detection. Curve fitting of the fractional survival data of the cell lines in response to various concentrations of the agents was used to calculate relative IC(50) , absolute IC(50) , and Y(min) values. The panel of 23 pediatric cancer cell lines included leukemia (n = 6), lymphoma (n = 2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), brain tumors (n = 3), Ewing family of tumors (EFT, n = 4), and neuroblastoma (n = 4). The doubling times obtained using DIMSCAN were incorporated into data analyses to estimate the relationship between input cell numbers and final cell number. RESULTS: We report in vitro activity data for three drugs (vincristine, melphalan, and etoposide) that are commonly used for pediatric cancer and for the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, an agent that is currently under preclinical investigation for cancer. To date, the PPTP has completed in vitro testing of 39 investigational and approved agents for single drug activity and two investigational agents in combination with various ""standard"" chemotherapy drugs.

Preliminary results of a phase-II trial.,379-87,10.1007/s00277-010-1090-2 [doi],"Decitabine and azacitidine, two DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, are the current standard of treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are also being tested against MDS. Both drug classes synergize in their gene reactivating and anticancer activities. The combination of hydralazine and valproate (Transkrip(R)), a DNMT and HDAC inhibitor, respectively), has been developed as epigenetic therapy under the drug repositioning concept. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of hydralazine and valproate against MDS, an open phase-II study for previously treated patients with MDS was conducted. The hydralazine dose was given according with the acetylator phenotype, and valproate was dosed at 30 mg/kg/day. Response was graded with International Working Group criteria. Toxicity was evaluated by the Common Toxemia Criteria-National Cancer Institute version 3 scale. From November 2007 to January 2010, 12 patients were included. Median age+/-SD was 53+/-19.78 years (range, 23-79 years); median time from diagnosis to inclusion in the study was 7.9 months (range 2.6-36.1 months). Median of previous treatment was 2 (range, 1-6). Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia was diagnosed in ten cases, and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in two. Overall response was documented in six (50%) of 12 cases, including one CR, one PR, and four hematological improvements of the erythroid series. Two patients (16.6%) progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. Hemoglobin increased from 7.4 to 10.3 g/dL (in 13 weeks), neutrophils, from 1.1 to 2.0 (in 3 weeks), and platelets, from 66x10(9) to 72x10(9)/L (in 2 weeks).

As an alternative treatment approach besides allogeneic transplantation, intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) was investigated at that time with the rationale of debulking disease burden and mobilization and transplantation of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) stem cells. In the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as state-of-the-art therapy for CML, the concept of autoHSCT has attracted only little interest and long-term follow-up and outcome data after autoHSCT in CML patients is scarce. In this long-term analysis, we report on 21 CML patients, mobilized in early chronic phase and transplanted with largely Ph- grafts, who received IFNalpha as maintenance therapy. Imatinib mesylate was administered upon cytogenetic relapse or disease progression while on IFN-alpha. The 10-year survival was 61% and 11 patients (52%) were alive at a median follow-up of 12.5 years (range 0.3-13.8) with eight patients in complete hematologic remission (CHR) and three of eight in major molecular remission (MMR). While all patients in MMR and two of five patients in CHR received imatinib, it is noteworthy that three patients remaining in CHR only received IFN-alpha maintenance after autoHSCT. With the limitations of a small patient population, this is the longest follow-up analysis demonstrating that autoHSCT in CML is very efficient to debulk the disease, restore Ph-negative hematopoiesis, and is able to induce major and sustained molecular responses in the majority of patients with substantial long-term survival rates.","['Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Waller, Cornelius F']","['Hackanson B', 'Waller CF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101005,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1094-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Apr;90(4):395-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1094-y.

METHODS: Adolescent survivors of brain tumor and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 99) provided information about their smoking histories and their intentions to smoke in the future. Behavior rating scales were completed by survivors, parents, and teachers. RESULTS: Past experimentation with smoking and higher levels of self-reported aggression were associated with intentions to smoke in the future (OR = 4.18, 95% CI 1.02-17.04, and OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, respectively), while teacher-ratings of inattention in the classroom were negatively associated with intentions to smoke (OR = 0.94, 95% CI.88-.99), all p < .05. Experimentation with smoking was more likely among older survivors (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.16-2.66, p < .01) and those whose parents had divorced (OR = 4.40, 95% CI 1.21-16.06, p < .05). DISCUSSION: A concerning minority of adolescent survivors have clear intentions to smoke, a behavior that adds to their overall health risk. Smoking intentions and experimentation are important precursors to regular smoking. Prevention efforts are needed to interrupt the progression from intentions and experimentation to established smoking and nicotine dependence in this medically vulnerable population. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Assessment of an adolescent's history of parental divorce, past experimentation with smoking, and aggressive behavior will identify those survivors who are likely to consider smoking in the future. Screening for these characteristics will allow clinicians to be more vigilant in health promotion.","['Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Tyc, Vida L', 'Wilson, Stephanie J', 'Nelms, Jenna', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Kahalley LS', 'Tyc VL', 'Wilson SJ', 'Nelms J', 'Hudson MM', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Hinds PS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. lskahall@texaschildrens.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101005,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Aggression', 'Attention', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality/*psychology', 'Child', 'Divorce', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Intention', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*psychology', 'Smoking/*psychology', '*Survivors']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-010-0149-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2011 Jun;5(2):123-31. doi: 10.1007/s11764-010-0149-3.

Post-radiation sarcomas account for 0.5-5.5% of all sarcomas; and include extra skeletal osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma leiomyosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Reports on post radiotherapy malignant fibrous histiocytoma in cervical cancer patients are rare. CASE REPORT: We present a case of 45-years-old female diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix stage IIB; she underwent a radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Five years later, she presented with ulcerated nodular masses in right and left medial aspect of thigh. Cytological and histological diagnosis of the masses was malignant fibrous histiocytoma which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: Post-irradiation sarcoma must be considered in patients of carcinoma cervix treated with radiotherapy, when soft tissue mass is seen in the previously irradiated area. It should be differentiated from metastasis from primary tumor with the help of appropriate markers as it has a grave prognosis.","['Arora, Prerna', 'Wadhwa, Rachna', 'Khurana, Nita', 'Jain, Shyama', 'Hadke, N S']","['Arora P', 'Wadhwa R', 'Khurana N', 'Jain S', 'Hadke NS']","['Department of Pathology, Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospitals, New Delhi, 110003, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20101005,Germany,Arch Gynecol Obstet,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,8710213,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/therapy', 'Female', 'Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Skin Ulcer/etiology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Thigh', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*therapy']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00404-010-1699-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2011 Mar;283 Suppl 1:79-82. doi: 10.1007/s00404-010-1699-3.

Members of the Bcl-2 family regulate this pathway, with anti-apoptotic members counteracting the effects of pro-apoptotic members. We investigated the effect on Mcl-1 function of mutation at a conserved threonine 163 residue (T163) in its proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine rich (PEST) region. Under normal growth conditions, Mcl-1 half-life increased with alteration of T163 to glutamic acid, but decreased with mutation to alanine. However, both T163 mutants exhibited greater pro-survival effects compared with the wild type, which can be explained by an increased stability of the T163A mutant in cytokine-starved conditions. Both the mutant forms exhibited prolonged binding to pro-apoptotic Bim in cytokine-deprived cells. The extent to which Mcl-1 mutants were able to exert their anti-apoptotic effects correlated with their ability to associate with Bim. We further observed that primary bone marrow derived macrophages survived following cytokine withdrawal as long as Bim and Mcl-1 remained associated. In our study, we were unable to detect a role for GSK-3-mediated regulation of Mcl-1 expression. Based on these results we propose that upon cytokine withdrawal, survival of hemopoietic cells depends on association between Mcl-1 and Bim. Furthermore, alteration of T163 of Mcl-1 may change the protein such that its association with Bim is affected, resulting in prolonged association and increased survival.","['Jamil, Sarwat', 'Wang, Shih Wei', 'Bondy, Lise', 'Mojtabavi, Shadi', 'Duronio, Vincent']","['Jamil S', 'Wang SW', 'Bondy L', 'Mojtabavi S', 'Duronio V']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC V6H 3Z6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*deficiency', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['o10-004 [pii]', '10.1139/o10-004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2010 Oct;88(5):809-18. doi: 10.1139/o10-004.,['MOP-74481/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively investigated 70 patients with acute cutaneous GVHD after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation or donor lymphocyte infusion. Complete and partial responses with a median duration of 10 months were achieved in 49 (70%) and 17 (24.3%) patients, respectively. Overall, 47 (67.1%) patients were not treated with systemic steroids. Furthermore, immunosuppression could be tapered in 24 (34.3%) patients while they were receiving UVA-1 treatment. Responses were seen irrespective of age or type of conditioning. Treatment was very well tolerated. After a median follow-up of 18 (range 10-60) months, three patients developed epithelial skin neoplasia.

The objective of the study was to examine the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-4 gene on aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics at the genetic and molecular levels. METHODS: Aspirin-intolerant (AIA, n=103) and aspirin-tolerant asthmatics (n=270) were genotyped and functional promoter assays were performed. RESULTS: Of 15 SNPs tested, seven (-589T>C (rs2243250) in promoter, -33T>C (rs2070874) in the 5'-untranslated region, +4047A>G (rs2243266), +4144C>G (rs2243267), +4221C>A (rs2243268), +4367G>A (rs2243270), and +5090A>G (rs2243274) in introns) were significantly associated with AIA risk. The frequency of the rare allele (C) of -589T>C was higher in the AIA group than in the aspirin-tolerant asthmatic group (P=0.016), and a gene dose-dependent decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s was noted after an aspirin challenge (P=0.0009). Aspirin unregulated IL-4 mRNA production in Jurkat T and K562 leukemia cells. A reporter plasmid assay revealed that aspirin augmented IL-4 promoter transactivation with the -589T>C C and -33T>C C alleles, compared with that bearing the -589T>C T and -33T>C T alleles. Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed the formation of nuclear complexes with -33T>C and -589T>C allele-containing probes; this was augmented by aspirin. The complexes formed with the -33T>C and -589T>C probes were shifted by treatment with anti-CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins beta and anti-nuclear factor of activated T-cells antibodies, respectively, indicating the inclusion of these transcription factors. CONCLUSION: Aspirin may regulate IL4 expression in an allele-specific manner by altering the availability of transcription factors to the key regulatory elements in the IL4 promoter, leading to aspirin hypersensitivity.","['Kim, Byung Soo', 'Park, Se-Min', 'Uhm, Tae Gi', 'Kang, Jin Hyun', 'Park, Jong-Sook', 'Jang, An-Soo', 'Uh, Soo-Taek', 'Kim, Mi-Kyeong', 'Choi, Inseon S', 'Cho, Sang Heon', 'Hong, Cheon-Soo', 'Lee, Yong Won', 'Lee, Jae-Young', 'Choi, Byoung Whui', 'Park, Hae-Sim', 'Park, Byung Lae', 'Shin, Hyoung Doo', 'Chung, Il Yup', 'Park, Choon-Sik']","['Kim BS', 'Park SM', 'Uhm TG', 'Kang JH', 'Park JS', 'Jang AS', 'Uh ST', 'Kim MK', 'Choi IS', 'Cho SH', 'Hong CS', 'Lee YW', 'Lee JY', 'Choi BW', 'Park HS', 'Park BL', 'Shin HD', 'Chung IY', 'Park CS']","['Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, College of Science and Technology, Hanyang University, Sangrok Ku, Ansan, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Asthma/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Drug Tolerance/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283402155 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2010 Dec;20(12):748-58. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283402155.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many children with leukemia display behavioral and emotional problems. Promoting children's psychological development and quality of life during hospitalization is an important activity carried out by health professionals. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the experiences and feelings of Chinese children with leukemia in the hospital. METHOD: In-depth interviews were conducted with Chinese children with leukemia using a descriptive qualitative research method. The data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine children with leukemia were interviewed. Almost all children had negative experiences and feelings during the early stage of hospitalization, and there were 3 levels of adaptation that they displayed: inability to adapt to hospitalization, a sense of being compelled to accept hospitalization, and adaptation to hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Three factors are associated with children's psychological distress, including the duration of treatment, children's personality, and age. Children of a younger age, with more extrovert personalities and who were undergoing longer treatment courses, adapted to hospitalization more easily. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings provide information for health professionals to understand children's psychological status during hospitalization and help nurses to plan individualized psychological care for children.","['Han, Jing', 'Liu, Jun-E', 'Xiao, Qian', 'Zheng, Xiao-Lei', 'Ma, Yue-Hong', 'Ding, Yan-Ming']","['Han J', 'Liu JE', 'Xiao Q', 'Zheng XL', 'Ma YH', 'Ding YM']","['School of Nursing, Capital Medical University, Beijing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child Welfare/psychology', 'China', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emotions', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Psychology, Child', 'Psychometrics', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life/psychology', '*Stress, Psychological']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181efea47 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2011 Mar-Apr;34(2):134-41. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181efea47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, this DNA-modifying enzyme was detected in nonlymphoid cells within several inflamed tissues and strongly implicated in malignant transformation. This study examines whether a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway, often linked to inflammation, influences AID expression in activated B lymphocytes. In this paper, we report that dividing human B cells responding to surrogate C3d-coated Ag, IL-4, and BAFF express AID, as well as COX-2. A progressive increase in AID with each division was paralleled by a division-related increase in a COX-2-linked enzyme, microsomal PGE(2) synthase-1, and the PGE(2)R, EP2. Cells with the greatest expression of AID expressed the highest levels of EP2. Although COX-2 inhibitors diminished both AID expression and IgG class switching, exogenous PGE(2) and butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, augmented AID mRNA/protein and increased the numbers of IgG(+) progeny. Despite the latter, the proportion of IgG(+) cells within viable progeny generally declined with PGE(2) supplementation. This was not due to PGE(2)-promoted differentiation to plasma cells or to greater downstream switching. Rather, because phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated levels were increased in progeny of PGE(2)-supplemented cultures, it appears more likely that PGE(2) facilitates AID-dependent DNA double-strand breaks that block B cell cycle progression or promote activation-induced cell death, or both. Taken together, the results suggest that a PGE(2) feed-forward mechanism for augmenting COX-2 pathway proteins promotes progressively increased levels of AID mRNA, protein, and function.","['Lee, Hyunjoo', 'Trott, Joshua S', 'Haque, Shabirul', 'McCormick, Steven', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Mongini, Patricia K A']","['Lee H', 'Trott JS', 'Haque S', 'McCormick S', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Mongini PK']","['Laboratory of B Cell Biology, Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*biosynthesis', 'Dinoprostone/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",2010/10/06 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000574 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000574 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Nov 1;185(9):5300-14. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000574.

We have examined the role of PMVs in the terminal differentiation of monocytes. The myeloid-differentiating agents all-trans retinoic acid/PMA and histamine, the inflammatory mediator that inhibits promonocyte proliferation, induced an intracellular Ca(2+)-mediated PMV (as opposed to exosome) release from THP-1 promonocytes. These PMVs cause THP-1 cells to enter G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and induce terminal monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Use of the TGF-beta receptor antagonist SB-431542 and anti-TGF-beta1 Ab showed that this was due to TGF-beta1 carried on PMVs. Although TGF-beta1 levels have been shown to increase in cell culture supernatants during macrophage differentiation and dendritic cell maturation, the presence of TGF-beta1 in PMVs is yet to be reported. In this study, to our knowledge we show for the first time that TGF-beta1 is carried on the surface of PMVs, and we confirm the presence within PMVs of certain leaderless proteins, with reported roles in myeloid cell differentiation. Our in vitro findings support a model in which TGF-beta1-bearing PMVs, released from promonocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) or primary peripheral blood monocytes on exposure to sublytic complement or after treatment with a differentiation therapy agent, such as all-trans retinoic acid, significantly reduce proliferation of THP-1 cells. Such PMVs also induce the terminal differentiation of primary peripheral blood monocytes as well as THP-1 monocytes.","['Ansa-Addo, Ephraim A', 'Lange, Sigrun', 'Stratton, Dan', 'Antwi-Baffour, Samuel', 'Cestari, Igor', 'Ramirez, Marcel I', 'McCrossan, Maria V', 'Inal, Jameel M']","['Ansa-Addo EA', 'Lange S', 'Stratton D', 'Antwi-Baffour S', 'Cestari I', 'Ramirez MI', 'McCrossan MV', 'Inal JM']","['Cellular and Molecular Immunology Research Centre, School of Human Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, London Metropolitan University, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exocytosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism']",2010/10/06 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1001656 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1001656 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Nov 1;185(9):5236-46. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1001656.

However, its role in the genesis of these diseases remains elusive. We report a mouse bone marrow transplantation model harboring an oncogenic G12D mutation in the Nras locus. Approximately 95% of recipient mice develop a myeloproliferative disease resembling the myeloproliferative variant of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), with a prolonged latency and acquisition of multiple genetic alterations, including uniparental disomy of oncogenic Nras allele. Based on single-cell profiling of phospho-proteins, a novel population of CMML cells is identified to display aberrant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling in both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) pathways. This abnormal signaling is acquired during CMML development. Further study suggests that aberrant Ras/ERK signaling leads to expansion of granulocytic/monocytic precursors, which are highly responsive to GM-CSF. Hyperactivation of Stat5 in CMML cells is mainly through expansion of these precursors rather than up-regulation of surface expression of GM-CSF receptors. Our results provide insights into the aberrant cytokine signaling in oncogenic NRAS-associated myeloid diseases.","['Wang, Jinyong', 'Liu, Yangang', 'Li, Zeyang', 'Du, Juan', 'Ryu, Myung-Jeom', 'Taylor, Philip R', 'Fleming, Mark D', 'Young, Ken H', 'Pitot, Henry', 'Zhang, Jing']","['Wang J', 'Liu Y', 'Li Z', 'Du J', 'Ryu MJ', 'Taylor PR', 'Fleming MD', 'Young KH', 'Pitot H', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Genes, ras/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60888-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-281527 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):5991-6002. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-281527.

However, as their origin remains unidentified, we examined the formation mechanism, the stability, and the fate of secosterols in vitro and in vivo. About 40% of secosterol-A remained unchanged after 3 h incubation in the FBS-free medium, whereas 20% and 40% were converted to its aldehyde-oxidation product, 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-secocholestan-6-oic acid, and secosterol-B, respectively.

Screening of patient blood samples to determine drug response before commencement of treatment is needed. This project aimed to construct and evaluate a self-bioluminescent reporter strain of Escherichia coli for use as an Ara-C biosensor and to design an in vitro assay to predict Ara-C response in clinical samples. METHODS: We used transposition mutagenesis to create a cytidine deaminase (cdd)-deficient mutant of E. coli MG1655 that responded to Ara-C. The strain was transformed with the luxCDABE operon and used as a whole-cell biosensor for development an 8-h assay to determine Ara-C uptake and phosphorylation by leukemic cells. RESULTS: Intracellular concentrations of 0.025 mumol/L phosphorylated Ara-C were detected by significantly increased light output (P < 0.05) from the bacterial biosensor. Results using AML cell lines with known response to Ara-C showed close correlation between the 8-h assay and a 3-day cytotoxicity test for Ara-C cell killing. In retrospective tests with 24 clinical samples of bone marrow or peripheral blood, the biosensor-based assay predicted leukemic cell response to Ara-C within 8 h. CONCLUSIONS: The biosensor-based assay may offer a predictor for evaluating the sensitivity of leukemic cells to Ara-C before patients undergo chemotherapy and allow customized treatment of drug-sensitive patients with reduced Ara-C dose levels. The 8-h assay monitors intracellular Ara-CTP (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate) levels and, if fully validated, may be suitable for use in clinical settings.","['Alloush, Habib M', 'Anderson, Elizabeth', 'Martin, Ashley D', 'Ruddock, Mark W', 'Angell, Johanna E', 'Hill, Phil J', 'Mehta, Priyanka', 'Smith, M Ann', 'Smith, J Graham', 'Salisbury, Vyv C']","['Alloush HM', 'Anderson E', 'Martin AD', 'Ruddock MW', 'Angell JE', 'Hill PJ', 'Mehta P', 'Smith MA', 'Smith JG', 'Salisbury VC']","['Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Biosensing Techniques', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Escherichia coli/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mutation', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/genetics', 'Phosphorylation']",2010/10/06 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2010.145581 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2010.145581 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2010 Dec;56(12):1862-70. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2010.145581.

Some AN components are shown to induce apoptosis; however, we previously demonstrated that AN extract (ANE) and the 30-100kDa fraction of ANE (ANE 30-100K) induced autophagy-like responses, such as swollen cell morphology, empty cytoplasm, acidic vesicles, and LC3-II accumulation, in an oral cancer cell line, OECM-1. To further assess the responses of other cell types to ANE 30-100K, we used both normal and malignant cells as the targets of ANE 30-100K and found that normal oral fibroblasts (CMT415), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), Jurkat leukemia T cells, and esophageal carcinoma cells (CE81T/VGH) exhibited similar responses after ANE 30-100K challenge. ANE 30-100K drastically increased acidic vesicle-containing PBLs isolated from two independent donors (from 0.1% to 92.1% and 2.9% to 64.2%). Furthermore, both ANE- and ANE 30-100K-induced LC3-II accumulation in CMT415 and CE81T/VGH was further increased in the presence of the lysosomal protease inhibitors (pepstatin A, E64d, and leupeptin). On the other hand, ANE 30-100K also increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the ROS scavengers, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Tiron, inhibited ANE 30-100K-induced cell death and LC3-II accumulation. Collectively, these results suggest the existence of an autophagy-inducing AN ingredient (AIAI) in ANE 30-100K, which renders ANE as an autophagic flux inducer through ROS in both normal and malignant cells.","['Lin, Mei-Huei', 'Hsieh, Wan-Fang', 'Chiang, Wei-Fan', 'Hong, Wen-Zhai', 'Hsu, Yu-Rung', 'Cheng, Yon-Chi', 'Chen, Tai-Chi', 'Hsu, Kai-Cheng', 'Lin, Pin-Yan', 'Liu, Shyun-Yeu', 'Liu, Young-Chau']","['Lin MH', 'Hsieh WF', 'Chiang WF', 'Hong WZ', 'Hsu YR', 'Cheng YC', 'Chen TC', 'Hsu KC', 'Lin PY', 'Liu SY', 'Liu YC']","['Department of Biotechnology, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oral Oncol,Oral oncology,9709118,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Areca/*chemistry', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1368-8375(10)00233-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.oraloncology.2010.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Oncol. 2010 Nov;46(11):822-8. doi: 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2010.08.002.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The malignant B-cells of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are prime examples of this premise, having been shown to generate a variety of ways of suppressing T-cell anti-tumour immune responses and these are summarized here. These mechanisms range from impairment of antigen presentation by the tumour cells themselves, to suppression of the immune microenvironment by contact dependent pathways and alterations in the cytokine milieu. By understanding these defects, novel targeted therapies can be developed with the aim of restoring T-cell function. Indeed, some of the recent advances in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia have been demonstrated to have profound immunomodulatory effects, repairing these defects in T-cell function.","['Riches, John C', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Gribben, John G']","['Riches JC', 'Ramsay AG', 'Gribben JG']","['Institute of Cancer, Barts and The London School of Medicine, Charterhouse Square, London, United Kingdom. j.c.riches@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101027,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/surgery/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(10)00084-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2010 Dec;20(6):431-8. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.09.006.

Here we show that ISA is a potent inhibitor of protein translation, and induces apoptosis accompanied with activation of the stress-activated protein kinases via the mitochondrial pathway in human leukemia Jurkat cells. ISA potently inhibited protein translation, and induced a slow but prolonged activation of the stress-activated protein kinases, JNK and p38, at between 1h and 6h after treatment. In Bcl-x(L)-transfected cells, the activation of JNK and p38 by ISA was shortened. The same results were obtained in the cells treated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting that the prolonged activation of JNK and p38 by ISA is mediated by reactive oxygen species generated from mitochondria. ISA strongly induced apoptosis, which was partially suppressed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125, but not by the p38 inhibitor SB202190. Apoptosis induction by ISA was partially reduced, but not suppressed by SP600125 in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells. These results suggest that ISA activates stress-activated kinases by a mitochondria-mediated mechanism, and that activation of JNK is required for caspase-8-dependent apoptosis.","['Chinen, Takumi', 'Nagumo, Yoko', 'Watanabe, Tsubasa', 'Imaizumi, Takamichi', 'Shibuya, Masatoshi', 'Kataoka, Takao', 'Kanoh, Naoki', 'Iwabuchi, Yoshiharu', 'Usui, Takeo']","['Chinen T', 'Nagumo Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Imaizumi T', 'Shibuya M', 'Kataoka T', 'Kanoh N', 'Iwabuchi Y', 'Usui T']","['Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai, Tsukuba 305-8572, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (psymberin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/*physiology', 'Coumarins', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2010/10/06 06:00,2010/12/18 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(10)01705-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.09.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2010 Dec 15;199(3):341-6. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.09.017.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHODS: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare linked database, we conducted an exploratory study comparing autoimmune conditions in 418 HCL cases (aged >/=65 years) and 160,086 controls. RESULTS: Overall, the proportion with autoimmune conditions was similar between HCL cases and controls (n = 79 (18.9%) and n = 29,284 (18.3%), respectively). Before diagnosis/selection, there was no overall difference in the prevalence of autoimmune conditions in HCL cases (n = 37, 8.9%) compared with controls (n = 14,085, 8.8%), p = 0.969. However, compared with controls, HCL cases more frequently had sarcoidosis (OR 9.6, 95%CI 2.4-39.5), Sjogren syndrome (OR 6.1, 95%CI 2.0-19.3) and erythema nodosum (OR 37, 95%CI 4.9-284) before diagnosis. Autoimmune conditions were also more common in HCL cases than controls around the time of diagnosis/selection (p < 0.001) but not subsequently. CONCLUSIONS: The findings do not support an overall relationship between autoimmune conditions and HCL, although the association with some autoimmune conditions prior to HCL diagnosis may warrant further investigation. Our findings also suggest that autoimmune conditions in HCL patients may be detected around the time of diagnosis.","['Anderson, Lesley A', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Anderson LA', 'Engels EA']","[""Cancer Epidemiology and Health Services Research Group, Centre for Public Health, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK. l.anderson@qub.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101004,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Male']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-3-35 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-3-35 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2010 Oct 4;3:35. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-3-35.,,PMC2958876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, nearly 100 different chromosome bands have been described in rearrangements involving 11q23 and 64 fusion genes have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level. In this work we present the identification of a novel MLL fusion partner in a pediatric patient with de novo biphenotypic acute leukemia. METHODS: Cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular studies (RT-PCR and LDI-PCR), and bioinformatic sequence analysis were used to characterize the CT45A2 gene as novel MLL fusion partner in pediatric acute leukemia. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization of bone marrow G-banded metaphases demonstrated a cryptic insertion of 11q23 in Xq26.3 involving the MLL gene. Breakpoint fusion analysis revealed that a DNA fragment of 653 kb from 11q23, containing MLL exons 1-9 in addition to 16 other 11q23 genes, was inserted into the upstream region of the CT45A2 gene located at Xq26.3. In addition, a deletion at Xq26.3 encompassing the 3' region of the DDX26B gene (exons 9-16) and the entire CT45A1 gene was identified. RNA analysis revealed the presence of a novel MLL-CT45A2 fusion transcript in which the first 9 exons of the MLL gene were fused in-frame to exon 2 of the CT45A2 gene, resulting in a spliced MLL fusion transcript with an intact open reading frame. The resulting chimeric transcript predicts a fusion protein where the N-terminus of MLL is fused to the entire open reading frame of CT45A2. Finally, we demonstrate that all breakpoint regions are rich in long repetitive motifs, namely LINE/L1 and SINE/Alu sequences, but all breakpoints were exclusively identified outside these repetitive DNA sequences. CONCLUSION: We have identified CT45A2 as a novel spliced MLL fusion partner in a pediatric patient with de novo biphenotypic acute leukemia, as a result of a cryptic insertion of 11q23 in Xq26.3. Since CT45A2 is the first Cancer/Testis antigen family gene found fused with MLL in acute leukemia, future studies addressing its biologic relevance for leukemogenesis are warranted.","['Cerveira, Nuno', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Santos, Joana', 'Torres, Lurdes', 'Lisboa, Susana', 'Pinheiro, Manuela', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Correia, Cecilia', 'Norton, Lucilia', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Teixeira, Manuel R']","['Cerveira N', 'Meyer C', 'Santos J', 'Torres L', 'Lisboa S', 'Pinheiro M', 'Bizarro S', 'Correia C', 'Norton L', 'Marschalek R', 'Teixeira MR']","['Department of Genetics of the Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100929,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CT45A1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/ultrastructure', 'Exons', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-518 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-518 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Sep 29;10:518. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-518.,,PMC2956734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objectives were to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in critically ill AML patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AML admitted to ICU at the University of Alberta Hospital between January 1st 2002 and June 30th 2008. Each case was matched by age, sex, and illness severity (ICU only) to two control groups: hospitalized AML controls, and non-AML ICU controls. Data were extracted on demographics, course of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 45 AML patients with available data were admitted to ICU. Mean (SD) age was 54.8 (13.1) years and 28.9% were female. Primary diagnoses were sepsis (32.6%) and respiratory failure (37.3%). Mean (SD) APACHE II score was 30.3 (10.3), SOFA score 12.6 (4.0) with 62.2% receiving mechanical ventilation, 55.6% vasoactive therapy, and 26.7% renal replacement therapy. Crude in-hospital, 90-day and 1-year mortality was 44.4%, 51.1% and 71.1%, respectively. AML cases had significantly higher adjusted-hazards of death (HR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.38-3.60, p = 0.001) compared to both non-AML ICU controls (HR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.11-2.58, p = 0.02) and hospitalized AML controls (OR 1.0, reference variable). Factors associated with ICU mortality by univariate analysis included older age, AML subtype, higher baseline SOFA score, no change or an increase in early SOFA score, shock, vasoactive therapy and mechanical ventilation. Active chemotherapy in ICU was associated with lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: AML patients may represent a minority of all critically ill admissions; however, are not uncommonly supported in ICU. These AML patients are characterized by high illness severity, multi-organ dysfunction, and high treatment intensity and have a higher risk of death when compared with matched hospitalized AML or non-AML ICU controls. The absence of early improvement in organ failure may be a useful predictor for mortality for AML patients admitted to ICU.","['Roze des Ordons, Amanda L', 'Chan, Kris', 'Mirza, Imran', 'Townsend, Derek R', 'Bagshaw, Sean M']","['Roze des Ordons AL', 'Chan K', 'Mirza I', 'Townsend DR', 'Bagshaw SM']","['Division of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G2B7 Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-516 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-516 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Sep 28;10:516. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-516.,,PMC2955611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, we identified all incident cases of AML admitted to UK hospitals between 1998 and 2007. We calculated the number of bone marrow transplantations undertaken in AML patients, stratifying our results by gender, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, degree of socioeconomic deprivation and co-morbidity. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for bone marrow transplantation, adjusting for gender, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, degree of socioeconomic deprivation and co-morbidity score. RESULTS: We identified a total of 23 910 incident cases of AML over this 10-year time period, of whom 1 140 (4.8%) underwent BMT. Bone marrow transplantation declined with increasing socioeconomic deprivation (p for trend < 0.001) such that people in the most deprived socioeconomic quintile were 40% less likely to have a transplant than those in the most advantaged group (Odds Ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.73), even after adjusting for gender, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis and co-morbidity. CONCLUSION: This large cohort study demonstrates that AML patients from lower socioeconomic classes are less likely to undergo bone marrow transplantation than their better off counter-parts.","['Bhayat, Fatima', 'Das-Gupta, Emma', 'Hubbard, Richard']","['Bhayat F', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Hubbard R']","['Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.

These studies have been conducted in European populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of ALL. To explore the impact of these variants on ALL risk in the Thai population, we genotyped 190 cases of ALL and 182 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), rs7089424 and rs10821938 (10q21.2), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Consistent with findings in European populations, rs4132601 genotype was significantly associated with risk of ALL (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-2.44; p = 0.04), and rs10821938 genotype was significantly associated with B-cell precursor ALL (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.97; p = 0.03). There were, however, differences in allele frequencies in SNPs observed between Thai and Caucasian populations (e.g. IKZF1, rs4132601; risk allele frequency [RAF] ratio of 0.36 for Thai/Caucasian). These differences, combined with differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between populations or differences in effect size between populations, may contribute to racial differences in ALL incidence.","['Vijayakrishnan, Jayaram', 'Sherborne, Amy L', 'Sawangpanich, Ruchchadol', 'Hongeng, Suradej', 'Houlston, Richard S', 'Pakakasama, Samart']","['Vijayakrishnan J', 'Sherborne AL', 'Sawangpanich R', 'Hongeng S', 'Houlston RS', 'Pakakasama S']","['Section of Cancer Genetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asians/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Whites/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/06 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/10/06 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.511356 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Oct;51(10):1870-4. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.511356.,['C1298/A8362/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this case report, we describe an unusually high number of CD5+ B-cells (B1a cells) following transplant. METHODS: B1a cells identified during routine follow-up by immunophenotypic analysis in a middle-aged man who had a haploidentical stem cell transplant for acute myeloid leukemia were compared with a reference set of post-transplant samples. RESULTS: Increased but polyclonal B1a cells were identified with 100% donor chimerism. CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates that a high absolute number of B1a cells may be seen post-transplant and should not be confused with an atypical CD5+ lymphoproliferative disorder. Furthermore, the population of polyclonal CD5+ B lymphocytes from the patient's donor is prominent 7 months post-transplant. This suggests that the maintenance of CD5+ B1 cells prior to conversion to adult-type CD5(-) B2 cells is not hindered by the recipient adult stromal environment.","['Hillard, Robert A', 'Lekakis, Lazaros J', 'Pulliam, Joseph F']","['Hillard RA', 'Lekakis LJ', 'Pulliam JF']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Chandler Medical Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA. rahill5@email.uky.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20101001,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Activated KIT kinase is therefore a promising molecular target for the treatment of many malignancies harboring KIT activation. Here we examined the potency of a novel KIT inhibitor KI-328 against different types of mutant KIT kinases recurrently identified in AML. KI-328 shows selective potency against KIT kinase for the in vitro kinase assay, and inhibits the growth of wild-type (Wt)- and mutant-KIT-expressing cells, while it has little potency against D816V-KIT. Comparable analysis of several potent KIT inhibitors regarding growth inhibitory effects on a variety of mutant-KIT-expressing cells revealed that multi-kinase inhibitors have the same potency against D816V-KIT as other mutant KITs; however, the predominant potency against D816V-KIT was observed in heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibitors suppress the growth of D816V-KIT-expressing cells at the concentration at which the growth of other mutant-KIT-expressing cells is not affected. These results collectively indicated that potent KIT inhibitors have different potency against the type of mutant KIT kinases. Therefore, KIT inhibitors are required to validate potency against several types of mutant KIT kinases for the clinical development.","['Tsujimura, Akane', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Shiotsu, Yukimasa', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Mori, Yumiko', 'Ishida, Hiroshi', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Tsujimura A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Shiotsu Y', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Mori Y', 'Ishida H', 'Toki T', 'Ito E', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101005,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (KI 328)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carbamates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0692-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Nov;92(4):624-33. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0692-8.

We have screened the antitumoural activity of a panel of sulphated EPSs produced by a newly discovered species of halophilic bacteria. We found that the novel halophilic bacterium Halomonas stenophila strain B100 produced a heteropolysaccharide that, when oversulphated, exerted antitumoural activity on T cell lines deriving from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Only tumour cells were susceptible to apoptosis induced by the sulphated EPS (B100S), whilst primary T cells were resistant. Moreover, freshly isolated primary cells from the blood of patients with ALL were also susceptible to B100S-induced apoptosis. The newly discovered B100S is therefore the first bacterial EPS that has been demonstrated to exert a potent and selective pro-apoptotic effect on T leukaemia cells, and thus, we propose that the search for new antineoplastic drugs should include the screening of other bacterial EPSs, particularly those isolated from halophiles.","['Ruiz-Ruiz, Carmen', 'Srivastava, Girish K', 'Carranza, Diana', 'Mata, Juan A', 'Llamas, Inmaculada', 'Santamaria, Manuel', 'Quesada, Emilia', 'Molina, Ignacio J']","['Ruiz-Ruiz C', 'Srivastava GK', 'Carranza D', 'Mata JA', 'Llamas I', 'Santamaria M', 'Quesada E', 'Molina IJ']","['Institute of Biopathology and Regenerative Medicine, Centre for Biomedical Research, University of Granada Health-Sciences Technology Park, Avda. del Conocimiento s/n, 18100, Armilla-Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101003,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Halomonas/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Chloride/*metabolism', 'Soil Microbiology']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00253-010-2886-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 Jan;89(2):345-55. doi: 10.1007/s00253-010-2886-7.

It was shown that NFkB activation in MM tumors results mainly from extrinsic signaling by APRIL and BAFF ligands that stimulate receptors on normal plasma cells as well as on pre-malignant monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM tumors. However, the mutations that occur during MM progression and that constitutively activate NFkB would be expected to decrease dependence of tumor cells on the bone marrow microenvironment. These mutations can activate the classical or alternative NFkB pathways selectively, but usually both pathways are activated in MM. Significantly, activation of either NFkB pathway leads to a similar response of MM cell lines. This frequent activation of the alternative pathway distinguishes MM from other B-cell tumors, which more frequently have mutations that are predicted to activate only the classical NFkB pathway. Given the strong dependence of MGUS and MM tumors on NFkB pathway activation, inhibition by a combination of targeting extrinsic signaling plus both NFkB pathways appears to be an attractive therapeutic approach in MM tumors.","['Demchenko, Yulia N', 'Kuehl, W Michael']","['Demchenko YN', 'Kuehl WM']","['Genetics Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['109 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.109 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2010 May;1(1):59-68. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.109.,"['ZIA BC010910-02/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA SC006581-26/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2947827,,,,,,['NIHMS220641'],['NOTNLM'],"['Multiple myeloma', 'NFkB', 'cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'drug resistance', 'leukemia', 'mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed pyrosequencing to quantify the methylation level of HOXA5 genes in the bone marrow samples obtained from 50 patients with AML and 19 normal controls. The methylation percentage of HOXA5 in AML patients (median=65.4%, interquartile range=35.9-72.3%) was higher than that of HOXA5 in control patients (median=43.1%, interquartile range=36.7-49.6%, Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.012). The patients of the AML group who had a high methylation percentage (>70%) had a good prognosis with a 3-yr overall survival (OS) of 82.5%, whereas the patients with a low methylation percentage (</=70%) showed a 3-yr OS of 40.5% (P=0.048). Cox proportional hazards regression showed that the methylation percentages of HOXA5 were independently associated with the 3-yr OS of AML patients, regardless of their karyotypes. We propose that the quantification of HOXA5 methylation by pyrosequencing may be useful for predicting short-term prognosis in AML. However, the limitations of our study are the small sample size and its preliminary nature. Thus, a larger study should be performed to clearly determine the relationships among HOXA5 methylation levels, cytogenetics, and prognosis in AML patients.","['Kim, Shine Young', 'Hwang, Sang-Hyun', 'Song, Eun Joo', 'Shin, Ho Jin', 'Jung, Joo Seop', 'Lee, Eun Yup']","['Kim SY', 'Hwang SH', 'Song EJ', 'Shin HJ', 'Jung JS', 'Lee EY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'ROC Curve', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Rate']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['201010469 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.5.469 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Oct;30(5):469-73. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.5.469.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes cytarabine, especially in high-risk patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that a genetic variation of dCK and CDA genes may influence the risk of cytarabine-related toxicities and early response to treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included children diagnosed with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) stage III and IV. The patients received a modified St Jude Total Therapy Study XV protocol. Cytarabine was used during induction remission (low-dose cytarabine) and reinduction II (high-dose cytarabine) phases. Genotyping of dCK-360C>G and -201C>t and CDA 79A>C and 208G>A was performed. Minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of the induction phase was measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Ninety-four children with ALL (n=90) and LL (n=4) were analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 5.8 years (range, 0.4-15 years). All four SNPs showed predominant wild type alleles. There was no CDA-208A allele in our population. Children with dCK-360G allele were at risk of mucositis after receiving low-dose cytarabine (OR=3.7; 95%CI, 1.2--11.3). neither dCK nor CDA polymorphisms affected the MRD status at the end of the induction phase. CONCLUSION: The dCK-360G allele was found to increase the risk of mucositis after exposure to low-dose cytarabine in childhood ALL therapy.","['Banklau, Chumphorn', 'Jindadamrongwech, Sumalee', 'Sawangpanich, Ruchchadol', 'Apibal, Suntaree', 'Hongeng, Suradej', 'Paisooksantivatana, Karan', 'Pakakasama, Samart']","['Banklau C', 'Jindadamrongwech S', 'Sawangpanich R', 'Apibal S', 'Hongeng S', 'Paisooksantivatana K', 'Pakakasama S']","['Department of Pathology and Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. rasam@mahidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mucositis/chemically induced', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.5144/1658-3876.2010.103 [pii]', '10.1016/s1658-3876(10)50019-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2010;3(3):103-8. doi: 10.1016/s1658-3876(10)50019-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although administration of exogenous cytokines such as IL-2 can promote T cell survival, such strategies have many nonspecific activities and are often associated with toxicity. We show here that abrogating expression of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (Cbl-b), a negative regulator of lymphocyte activation, in tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells expanded ex vivo increased the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of disseminated leukemia in mice. Mechanistically, Cbl-b abrogation bypassed the requirement for exogenous IL-2 administration for tumor eradication in vivo. In addition, CD8(+) T cells lacking Cbl-b demonstrated a lower threshold for activation, better survival following target recognition and stimulation, and enhanced proliferative responses as a result of both IL-2-dependent and -independent pathways. Importantly, siRNA knockdown of Cbl-b in human CD8(+)CD28- effector T cell clones similarly restored IL-2 production and proliferation following target recognition independent of exogenous IL-2, enhanced IFN-gamma production, and increased target avidity. Thus, abrogating Cbl-b expression in effector T cells may improve the efficacy of adoptive therapy of some human malignancies.","['Stromnes, Ingunn M', 'Blattman, Joseph N', 'Tan, Xiaoxia', 'Jeevanjee, Sara', 'Gu, Hua', 'Greenberg, Philip D']","['Stromnes IM', 'Blattman JN', 'Tan X', 'Jeevanjee S', 'Gu H', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-6425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cblb protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology']",2010/10/05 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['41991 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI41991 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Oct;120(10):3722-34. doi: 10.1172/JCI41991.

During granulopoiesis, miR-34a targets E2F3 and blocks myeloid cell proliferation. Analysis of AML samples with CEBPA mutations revealed a lower expression of miR-34a and elevated levels of E2F3 as well as E2F1, a transcriptional target of E2F3. Manipulation of miR-34a reprograms granulocytic differentiation of AML blast cells with CEBPA mutations.

The discovery of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I specific inhibitory receptors (including the allotype-specific killer immunoglobulin-like receptors), and of various activating receptors and their ligands, provided the basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of NK-cell activation and function, mainly resulting from the balance between activating and inhibitory signals. In an allogeneic setting, such as T cell-depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, NK cells may express inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors that are not engaged by any of the HLA class I alleles present on allogeneic cells. Such ""alloreactive"" NK cells greatly contribute both to eradication of leukemia blasts escaping the preparative regimen and to clearance of residual host dendritic cells and T lymphocytes (thus preventing graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection, respectively). Improved prevention of graft-versus-host disease might be achieved by redirecting to lymph nodes adoptively transferred, alloreactive NK cells by inducing CCR7-uptake in vitro. Recent studies suggested that, after immune-suppressive therapy, alloreactive NK cells from an HLA-haploidentical donor may prevent leukemia recurrence also in patients who have not received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pende, Daniela', 'Marcenaro, Emanuela', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Alessandro']","['Moretta L', 'Locatelli F', 'Pende D', 'Marcenaro E', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta A']","['Giannina Gaslini Institute, Genova-Quarto, Italy. lorenzomoretta@ospedale-gaslini.ge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20101001,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Models, Immunological', 'Receptors, CCR7/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR/*immunology/metabolism']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)59655-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-264085 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 20;117(3):764-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-264085.

However, despite the activity of this agent, PTL also induces cellular protective responses that likely function to reduce its overall cytotoxicity. Thus, we sought to identify pharmacologic agents that enhance the antileukemic potential of PTL. Toward this goal, we used the gene expression signature of PTL to identify compounds that inhibit cytoprotective responses by performing chemical genomic screening of the Connectivity Map database. This screen identified compounds acting along the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. Compared with single agent treatment, exposure of AML cells to the combination of PTL and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors significantly decreased viability of AML cells and reduced tumor burden in vitro and in murine xenotransplantation models. Taken together, our data show that rational drug combinations can be identified using chemical genomic screening strategies and that inhibition of cytoprotective functions can enhance the eradication of primary human AML cells.","['Hassane, Duane C', 'Sen, Siddhartha', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', 'Rossi, Randall M', 'Corbett, Cheryl A', 'Balys, Marlene', 'Wei, Liping', 'Crooks, Peter A', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Hassane DC', 'Sen S', 'Minhajuddin M', 'Rossi RM', 'Corbett CA', 'Balys M', 'Wei L', 'Crooks PA', 'Guzman ML', 'Jordan CT']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA. dhassane@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101001,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', '624KN6GM2T (temsirolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60887-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-278044 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):5983-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-278044.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The type and extent of antileukemic interactions between cytarabine and VPA in clinically relevant pediatric AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts from children with AML were determined by MTT assays and standard isobologram analyses. The effects of cytarabine and VPA on apoptosis and cell cycle distributions were determined by flow cytometry analysis and caspase enzymatic assays. The effects of the two agents on DNA damage and Bcl-2 family proteins were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: We showed synergistic antileukemic activities between cytarabine and VPA in four pediatric AML cell lines and nine diagnostic AML blast samples. t(8;21) AML blasts were significantly more sensitive to VPA and showed far greater sensitivities to combined cytarabine and VPA than non-t(8;21) AML cases. Cytarabine and VPA cooperatively induced DNA double-strand breaks, reflected in induction of gammaH2AX and apoptosis, accompanied by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Further, VPA induced Bim expression and short hairpin RNA knockdown of Bim resulted in significantly decreased apoptosis induced by cytarabine and by cytarabine plus VPA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish global synergistic antileukemic activity of combined VPA and cytarabine in pediatric AML and provide compelling evidence to support the use of VPA in the treatment of children with this deadly disease.","['Xie, Chengzhi', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Xu, Xuelian', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Buck, Steven A', 'Stout, Mark L', 'Yu, Qun', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Xie C', 'Edwards H', 'Xu X', 'Zhou H', 'Buck SA', 'Stout ML', 'Yu Q', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Matherly LH', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 110 E.

Here, we provide new data reinforcing the importance of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis mediated by Fas in T-cell lymphoma development and about the functional significance of polymorphisms located at intracellular and extracellular domains of Fas and FasL. Using DNA recombinant technology, we generate chimerical Fas and FasL proteins by combination of protein regions derived from the two strains and demonstrate that any Fas-FasL interaction involving chimerical proteins drive cell apoptosis to a significant lower extent than the wild-type SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J Fas-FasL systems. In addition, we report new polymorphisms in the coding sequence of Fadd and demonstrate that the interaction between Fas and Fadd is significantly stronger if Fas and Fadd are of SEG/Pas origin compared with the C57BL/6J system. Altogether, these results suggest a model in which functional polymorphisms at the three genes collaborate on the global ability of the Fas/FasL system to induce apoptosis. A complete analysis of these three genes in the pathway appears to be a sine qua non condition to accurately predict the effectiveness of the Fas system and to estimate susceptibility to T-cell lymphoma.","['Villa-Morales, Maria', 'Gonzalez-Gugel, Elena', 'Shahbazi, Marta N', 'Santos, Javier', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, Jose']","['Villa-Morales M', 'Gonzalez-Gugel E', 'Shahbazi MN', 'Santos J', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J']","['Area de Biologia Celular e Inmunologia, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Nicolas Cabrera 1, 28049-Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101001,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*genetics/physiology', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/physiology']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq201 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq201 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Dec;31(12):2165-71. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq201.

METHODS: This case-control study included children aged 0-14 years diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL, n = 711) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 116) from 1995 to 2008. Controls were randomly selected from the California birth registry and individually matched to cases with respect to date of birth, sex, Hispanic ethnicity and maternal race. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to assess whether ALL or AML was associated with self-reported child's X-rays after birth (post-natal), including number of X-rays, region of the body X-rayed and age at first X-ray, as well as maternal X-rays before and during pregnancy (preconception and prenatal). RESULTS: After excluding X-rays in the year prior to diagnosis (reference date for matched controls), risk of ALL was elevated in children exposed to three or more post-natal X-rays [odds ratio (OR) = 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.79]. For B-cell ALL specifically, any exposure (one or more X-rays) conferred increased risk (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.86). Region of the body exposed was not an independent risk factor in multivariable analyses. No associations were observed between number of post-natal X-rays and AML (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.22) or T-cell ALL (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.59-1.19). Prevalence of exposure to prenatal and preconception X-rays was low, and no associations with ALL or AML were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that exposure to post-natal diagnostic X-rays is associated with increased risk of childhood ALL, specifically B-cell ALL, but not AML or T-cell ALL. Given the imprecise measures of self-reported X-ray exposure, the results of this analysis should be interpreted with caution and warrant further investigation.","['Bartley, Karen', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Ducore, Jonathan', 'Buffler, Patricia']","['Bartley K', 'Metayer C', 'Selvin S', 'Ducore J', 'Buffler P']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. kbartley@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101001,England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['dyq162 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyq162 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2010 Dec;39(6):1628-37. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyq162.

It is however not known whether ICSI has additional effects on the transcriptome of mouse blastocysts. METHODS: We compared gene expression and development of mouse blastocysts produced by ICSI and cultured in Whitten's medium (ICSI(WM)) or KSOM medium with amino acids (ICSI(KSOMaa)) with control blastocysts flushed out of the uterus on post coital Day 3.5 (in vivo). In addition, we compared gene expression in embryos generated by IVF or ICSI using WM. Global pattern of gene expression was assessed using the Affymetrix 430 2.0 chip. RESULTS: Blastocysts from ICSI fertilization have a reduction in the number of trophoblastic and inner cell mass cells compared with embryos generated in vivo. Approximately 1000 genes are differentially expressed between ICSI blastocyst and in vivo blastocysts; proliferation, apoptosis and morphogenetic pathways are the most common pathways altered after IVC. Unexpectedly, expression of only 41 genes was significantly different between embryo cultured in suboptimal conditions (WM) or optimal conditions (KSOM(aa)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that fertilization by ICSI may play a more important role in shaping the transcriptome of the developing mouse embryo than the culture media used.","['Giritharan, G', 'Li, M W', 'Di Sebastiano, F', 'Esteban, F J', 'Horcajadas, J A', 'Lloyd, K C K', 'Donjacour, A', 'Maltepe, E', 'Rinaudo, P F']","['Giritharan G', 'Li MW', 'Di Sebastiano F', 'Esteban FJ', 'Horcajadas JA', 'Lloyd KC', 'Donjacour A', 'Maltepe E', 'Rinaudo PF']","['Department of Obstetric, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101001,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Smarca1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 6)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Embryonic Development', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone Deacetylase 6', 'Histone Deacetylases/biosynthesis', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis', 'Protein Array Analysis', '*Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['deq266 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/deq266 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2010 Dec;25(12):3012-24. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deq266.

METHODS: Publications in English were searched in MEDLINE (1966-31 December 2009) and from the reference list of identified publications. Extraction of relative risk (RR) estimates was performed independently by 2 authors using predefined inclusion criteria. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for exposure time windows, residential exposure location, biocide category and type of leukaemia. RESULTS: RR estimates were extracted from 13 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2009. Statistically significant associations with childhood leukaemia were observed when combining all studies (mRR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.37-2.21). Exposure during and after pregnancy was positively associated with childhood leukaemia, with the strongest risk for exposure during pregnancy (mRR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.92-2.50). Other stratifications showed the greatest risk estimates for indoor exposure (mRR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.45-2.09), for exposure to insecticides (mRR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.33-2.26) as well as for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) (mRR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.53-3.45). Outdoor exposure and exposure of children to herbicides (after pregnancy) were not significantly associated with childhood leukaemia (mRR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.97-1.52; mRR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.76-1.76, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the assumption that residential pesticide exposure may be a contributing risk factor for childhood leukaemia but available data were too scarce for causality ascertainment. It may be opportune to consider preventive actions, including educational measures, to decrease the use of pesticides for residential purposes and particularly the use of indoor insecticides during pregnancy.","['Van Maele-Fabry, Genevieve', 'Lantin, Anne-Catherine', 'Hoet, Perrine', 'Lison, Dominique']","['Van Maele-Fabry G', 'Lantin AC', 'Hoet P', 'Lison D']","['Universite catholique de Louvain, Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Brussels, Belgium. genevieve.vanmaele@uclouvain.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,Netherlands,Environ Int,Environment international,7807270,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Air Pollution/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'MEDLINE', '*Pesticides/toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Assessment']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0160-4120(10)00166-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.envint.2010.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Int. 2011 Jan;37(1):280-91. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2010.08.016.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Treatment-naive, physically fit patients (aged 30-81 years) with CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2) per day) for the first 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without rituximab (375 mg/m(2) on day 0 of first course, and 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of second to sixth courses) in 190 centres in 11 countries. Investigators and patients were not masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00281918. FINDINGS: 408 patients were assigned to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy group) and 409 to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy group); all patients were analysed. At 3 years after randomisation, 65% of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were free of progression compared with 45% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0.56 [95% CI 0.46-0.69], p<0.0001); 87% were alive versus 83%, respectively (0.67 [0.48-0.92]; p=0.01). Chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (136 [34%] of 404 vs 83 [21%] of 396; p<0.0001) and leucocytopenia (97 [24%] vs 48 [12%]; p<0.0001). Other side-effects, including severe infections, were not increased. There were eight (2%) treatment-related deaths in the chemoimmunotherapy group compared with ten (3%) in the chemotherapy group. INTERPRETATION: Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Moreover, the results suggest that the choice of a specific first-line treatment changes the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

The CEBPA mutations are heterogeneous, including missense/nonsense base exchanges, frameshift mutations, and insertions/deletions being distributed throughout the gene. One of the genetic alterations within CEBPA (c.1175_1180dup; p.P194_H195dup) was later suggested to represent an inherited polymorphism. As this is not a simple single nucleotide polymorphism, but a six-base pair insertion that leads to a two amino acid elongation of the protein, functional implications cannot be excluded. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1135 AML patients from selected cytogenetic subgroups for CEBPA mutations. RESULTS: Besides acquired CEBPA mutation in 76 cases (6.7%), we detected the p.P194_H195dup polymorphism in 61 of 1135 AML cases (5.4%). In healthy controls, p.P194_H195dup was detected in a comparable frequency (10 of 187; 5.3%) and therefore is unlikely to be predisposing for AML. More detailed analysis (taking French-American-British classification subtype, cytogenetics, and etiology into account) showed no preference for the p.P194_H195dup for any subgroup. Prognosis of the AML with p.P194_H195dup was comparable with AML without CEBPAmut. In this primary cohort, we never detected coincidence of the p.P194_H195dup and a CEBPA mutation in the same AML patient. Validation of these results was performed in an independent cohort of 1131 AML cases: There were 67 CEBPA mutations (5.9%) and 55 p.P194_H195dup (4.9%). The p.P194_H195dup was again associated with unmutated CEBPA alleles. CONCLUSIONS: These results further confirm that the p.P194_H195dup is a polymorphism and illustrate the difficulties that can arise in the differentiation of genetic polymorphisms from malignancy-inducing alterations.","['Schnittger, Susanne', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Eder, Christiane', 'Lohse, Peter', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schnittger S', 'Bacher U', 'Eder C', 'Lohse P', 'Haferlach C', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.

METHODS: Twenty-seven nonalcoholic steatosis (NAST), 24 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 71 HCV, and 29 patients with histological normal liver (NL) were studied. Real-time PCR, the TUNEL assay, and Western blots were used to assess insulin-signaling molecules, hepatocyte apoptosis, antiapoptotic mediators, active caspase 3, and type I collagen in liver biopsies. HCV core-transfected human hepatocytes were used as an in vitro model. RESULTS: In NAFLD patients, hepatic levels of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1, IRS2 2, the p85alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85alpha), phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt), phosphorylated forkhead box-containing protein O subfamily-1 (FoxO), and phosphorylated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) as well as the antiapoptotic mediators B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia protein-1 (Mcl-1) were significantly lower in NASH than in NAST and NL. Furthermore, hepatocyte apoptosis and increased active caspase 3 were only present in NASH. In HCV patients, hepatic insulin signaling was markedly impaired, regardless of viral genotype and the presence of steatosis paralleled with enhanced apoptosis. In cultured human hepatocytes, HCV core protein decreased pAkt and increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). This effect was more pronounced in lipid-loaded hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic insulin signaling is impaired in NASH and HCV patients, and downregulation of insulin-sensitive targets is associated with increased apoptosis and fibrogenesis in both conditions. JNK might be a target for HCV-induced insulin resistance.","['Garcia-Monzon, Carmelo', 'Lo Iacono, Oreste', 'Mayoral, Rafael', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Agueda', 'Miquilena-Colina, Maria E', 'Lozano-Rodriguez, Tamara', 'Garcia-Pozo, Leonor', 'Vargas-Castrillon, Javier', 'Casado, Marta', 'Bosca, Lisardo', 'Valverde, Angela M', 'Martin-Sanz, Paloma']","['Garcia-Monzon C', 'Lo Iacono O', 'Mayoral R', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez A', 'Miquilena-Colina ME', 'Lozano-Rodriguez T', 'Garcia-Pozo L', 'Vargas-Castrillon J', 'Casado M', 'Bosca L', 'Valverde AM', 'Martin-Sanz P']","['Liver Research Unit, Hospital Universitario Santa Cristina, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100827,Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (IRS1 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen Type I/genetics', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Fatty Liver/complications/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/complications/genetics/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Hepatocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/genetics', 'Insulin Resistance/*physiology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver Cirrhosis/etiology/genetics/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-8278(10)00711-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2010.06.021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2011 Jan;54(1):142-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2010.06.021.

The methods investigated were fluorescent Western blotting and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) for detection of non-enriched and immunoaffinity enriched pTyr protein patterns. The same anti-phosphotyrosine specific antibody, 4G10, was used for both approaches. The results from fluorescent Western blotting of total proteins and from enriched CyDye DIGE pre-labeled pTyr proteins showed similar down regulation of phosphorylation upon treating of cells from a cancer model system (K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells) with imatinib. This treatment introduced a known perturbation of phosphorylation that enabled testing of these new approaches to analyze variations in tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Enrichment of pTyr proteins was found highly advantageous for the outcome.

To address this normal human bone marrow-, umbilical cord blood-, and mobilized peripheral blood-derived cells as well as 16 selected human leukemic cell lines were phenotyped for CXCR7 expression. The expression of CXCR7 in hematopoietic cell lines was analyzed at transcriptional level. The biologic significance of CXCR7 expression was subsequently tested in signal transduction studies as well as in in vitro proliferation and chemotactic assays. We noted that CXCR7 is expressed at very low levels (approximately 3-6%) in normal human CD34(+) cells isolated from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and mobilized peripheral blood. More importantly, when we employed I-TAC, which activates CXCR7, but not CXCR4, we did not observe any chemotactic responsiveness in human clonogenic progenitors. As expected, I-TAC also did not affect clonogenic growth of human CD34(+) cells. In contrast, functional CXCR7, whose expression is regulated in an NF-kappaBeta-dependent manner, as we report here, is highly expressed in several human myeloid malignant cell lines. I-TAC-induced activation of CXCR7 in human hematopoietic cell lines leads to phosphorylation of MAPKp42/44 and AKT, and enhanced cell adhesion and slightly cell migration. In conclusion, CXCR7 is expressed at very low level on normal human HSPCs and does not play a direct role in their proliferation or slightly cell migration; however, in contrast, it is involved in trafficking/adhesion of human leukemic cells.","['Tarnowski, Maciej', 'Liu, Rui', 'Wysoczynski, Marcin', 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Kucia, Magda', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Tarnowski M', 'Liu R', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (ACKR3 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL11 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL11)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL11/pharmacology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2010/10/05 06:00,2010/12/21 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01531.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Dec;85(6):472-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01531.x.,"['P20RR018733/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106281-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is well known that VK2 induces differentiation and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, little is known about its effect on normal hematopoietic progenitors. The effects of VK2 on primary myeloid and erythroid progenitors were examined. Mobilized CD34-positive cells from peripheral blood were used for the examination of myeloid lineage cells, and erythroid progenitors purified from peripheral blood were used for erythroid lineage cells. VK2 upregulated the expressions of myeloid markers CD11b and CD14, and increased the mRNA expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) and PU.1 in myeloid progenitors. In erythroid progenitors, VK2 did not show a significant effect on differentiation. However, VK2 exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect on erythroid progenitors under erythropoietin depletion. This anti-apoptotic effect was restricted to normal erythroid progenitors and was not shown in erythroleukemic cell line AS-E2. Steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR), which was recently identified as a receptor of VK2, was expressed on myeloid progenitors, and the SXR agonist rifampicin (RIF) also upregulated CD11b and CD14 expressions on myeloid progenitors. These results indicate that SXR is involved in the effect of VK2 on myeloid progenitors. The major effect of VK2 on myeloid progenitors was promoting differentiation, whereas its anti-apoptotic effect seemed to be dominant in erythroid progenitors. Although the detailed mechanism of VK2's effect on differentiation or apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors remains unknown, the effect of VK2 therapy in patients with MDS could be partly explained by these mechanisms.","['Sada, Eriko', 'Abe, Yasunobu', 'Ohba, Rie', 'Tachikawa, Yoshimichi', 'Nagasawa, Eriko', 'Shiratsuchi, Motoaki', 'Takayanagi, Ryoichi']","['Sada E', 'Abe Y', 'Ohba R', 'Tachikawa Y', 'Nagasawa E', 'Shiratsuchi M', 'Takayanagi R']","['Department of Medicine and Bioregulatory Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vitamins)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Vitamin K 2/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vitamins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2010/10/05 06:00,2010/12/21 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01530.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Dec;85(6):538-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01530.x.,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, the appearance ranges from papulosquamous to purpuric. Histopathologically, these reactions simulate a wide variety of lymphoma subtypes; the most frequently reported examples resemble mycosis fungoides. We report a 61-year-old female who developed a purpuric eruption prior to engraftment of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for stage IV mantle cell lymphoma. Skin biopsies showed a superficial perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of large, immature-appearing mononuclear cells associated with spongiosis, papillary dermal edema and erythrocyte extravasation. The cells were immunoreactive for T-cell markers and lacked B-cell marker expression, excluding recurrence of the underlying mantle cell lymphoma as a diagnostic possibility. The cutaneous eruption was temporally linked to levofloxacin administration and resolved after discontinuation of this medication. This is the first report of a lymphomatoid hypersensitivity reaction associated with fluoroquinolone use. The histopathologic features presented in this paper underscore the potential for misdiagnosis of such lesions as lymphoma or acute myeloid leukemia, particularly in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for underlying lymphoma or leukemia.

To further understand the antileukemic activity of indomethacin we have used untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic analysis to characterize the responses of KG1a and K562 cell lines in both normal culture conditions and in hypoxia, which better represents the tumor environment in vivo. Hypoxia induced dramatic metabolic changes in untreated KG1a and K562, including adaptation of both phospholipid and glycolytic metabolism. Despite these changes, both cell lines sustained relatively unaltered mitochondrial respiration. The administration of indomethacin induced similar metabolic responses regardless of the oxygen level in the environment. Notable exceptions included metabolites associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis and choline phospholipid metabolism. Collectively, these results suggest that leukemia cells have the inherent ability to tolerate changes in oxygen tension while maintaining an unaltered mitochondrial respiration. However, the administration of indomethacin significantly increased oxidative stress in both KG1a and K562, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, regardless of the oxygenation conditions. These findings emphasize the particular pertinence of the tricarboxylic acid cycle to the survival of cancer cells and may explain why some antileukemic drugs have been discovered and developed successfully despite the use of culture conditions that do not reflect the hypoxic environment of cancer cells in vivo.","['Lodi, Alessia', 'Tiziani, Stefano', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Gunther, Ulrich L', 'Bunce, Christopher M', 'Viant, Mark R']","['Lodi A', 'Tiziani S', 'Khanim FL', 'Drayson MT', 'Gunther UL', 'Bunce CM', 'Viant MR']","['The Henry Wellcome Building for Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy, School of Cancer Sciences, Medical School, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101018,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Citric Acid Cycle/*drug effects', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb900300j [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2011 Feb 18;6(2):169-75. doi: 10.1021/cb900300j.

Most remarkably, {(1R,2R,4R)-4-methyl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine}oxalatoplatinum(II), comprising an equatorial methyl substituent at position 4 of the cyclohexane ring, was as potent as oxaliplatin in vitro but distinctly more effective in the L1210 model in vivo at the optimal dose. The advantage observed in the in vivo situation was mainly based on a more favorable therapeutic index.

A combination of these cells is given the name minimal residual disease (MRD). Multicolor flow cytometry has recently attracted considerable interest as the most promising method for measuring the content of residual tumor blasts. This technique is based on the detection of the so-called leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP), i.e., a tumor-specific combination of the expression of membrane and cytoplasmic markers. Flow cytometry may be successfully used to monitor MRD in 90-95% cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in 80-85% of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia. The sensitivity of flow cytometry, which is real for routine flow techniques, is a possibility of identifying one cell among 10(4)-10(5) cells. Multicolor flow cytometry (that involves the simultaneous analysis of the expression of a few markers) is the most reasonable tool for MRD monitoring. The monoclonal antibody panels recommended by different groups of investigators for MRD monitoring in B-lineage ALL include antibodies to the pan-B-cell antigen CD19, markers of different stages of differentiation of B-lineage precursors of CD10, CD34, and CD20 and leukemia-associated markers different for each panel, such as CD22, CD38, CD58, CD45, TdT, CD13, CD33. The hyperexpression of CD10, CD34, CD19, TdT, the decreased expression of CD38, CD45, CD22, CD19, the simultaneous expression of markers of different stages of differentiation of B lymphocytes, such as CD10 and CD20, and the lymphoblast coexpression of myeloid markers of CD13, CD33, CDS15 are the most frequently described immunophenotype aberrations in B-lineage ALL. The selection of combinations of markers for MRD monitoring in children with T-ALL is based on the simultaneous expression of combinations of the antigens characteristic for early stages of differentiation of normal T lymphocytes, namely TdT and cytoplasmic CD3. Some authors consider the use of CD99 versus TdT to be most appropriate. There is recent evidence that MRD-positive patients have a higher cumulative risk for recurrences as compared with those without residual blasts. Moreover, the longer the tumor cells are retained during therapy, the worse the prognosis is. Thus, for choice of the adequate intensity of antitumor therapy, it is necessary to qualitatively and quantitatively assess MRD by multicolor flow cytometry at different stages of therapy.","['Popov, A M', 'Verzhbitskaia, T Iu', 'Tsaur, G A', 'Shorikov, E V', ""Savel'ev, L I"", 'Tsvirenko, S V', 'Fechina, L G']","['Popov AM', 'Verzhbitskaia TIu', 'Tsaur GA', 'Shorikov EV', ""Savel'ev LI"", 'Tsvirenko SV', 'Fechina LG']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Klin Lab Diagn,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,9432021,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2010/10/05 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Klin Lab Diagn. 2010 Aug;(8):36-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon alpha (IFN alpha) is efficacious in CML likely due to its immunomodulatory properties, and is synergistic in vitro with imatinib and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). METHODS: A study was undertaken to determine whether adding pegylated (PEG) IFN alpha-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib may improve the complete molecular response rate in patients with CML in chronic phase. Ninety-four patients were treated with imatinib 800 mg/d for the first 6 months, then randomly assigned to continue high-dose imatinib alone (n = 49) or in combination with PEG IFN alpha-2b 0.5 mug/kg/wk and GM-CSF 125 mg/m(2) 3x weekly (n = 45). RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 54 months (range, 7-70 months). There were no differences in the rates of complete cytogenetic response (87% vs 90%; P = 1.0), or of major (77% vs 77%; P = 1.0) or complete (11% vs 13%; P = 1.0) molecular response (on the international scale) at 12 months between the 2 arms, or at any time during the study. Adverse events led to PEG IFN alpha-2b discontinuation in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of PEG IFN alpha-2b and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib therapy does not improve significantly the cytogenetic or molecular response rates compared with high-dose imatinib alone. The high dropout rate in the PEG IFN alpha-2b arm may have compromised its potential immunomodulatory benefit.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Jones, Dan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Koller, Charles', 'Hiteshew, Jody', 'Shan, Jenny', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Jones D', 'Ravandi F', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Koller C', 'Hiteshew J', 'Shan J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

However, there is no systematic method to identify the attributes of a protective CD8(+) T cell response. Here, we combine theory and experiment to identify and quantify the contribution of all HLA class I alleles to host protection against infection with a given pathogen. In 432 HTLV-1-infected individuals we show that individuals with HLA class I alleles that strongly bind the HTLV-1 protein HBZ had a lower proviral load and were more likely to be asymptomatic. We also show that in general, across all HTLV-1 proteins, CD8(+) T cell effectiveness is strongly determined by protein specificity and produce a ranked list of the proteins targeted by the most effective CD8(+) T cell response through to the least effective CD8(+) T cell response. We conclude that CD8(+) T cells play an important role in the control of HTLV-1 and that CD8(+) cells specific to HBZ, not the immunodominant protein Tax, are the most effective. We suggest that HBZ plays a central role in HTLV-1 persistence. This approach is applicable to all pathogens, even where data are sparse, to identify simultaneously the HLA Class I alleles and the epitopes responsible for a protective CD8(+) T cell response.","['Macnamara, Aidan', 'Rowan, Aileen', 'Hilburn, Silva', 'Kadolsky, Ulrich', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Suemori, Koichiro', 'Yasukawa, Masaki', 'Taylor, Graham', 'Bangham, Charles R M', 'Asquith, Becca']","['Macnamara A', 'Rowan A', 'Hilburn S', 'Kadolsky U', 'Fujiwara H', 'Suemori K', 'Yasukawa M', 'Taylor G', 'Bangham CR', 'Asquith B']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Software', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1001117 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2010 Sep 23;6(9):e1001117. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001117.,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0601072/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT078326/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC2944806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report provides an approach to management that may be applicable in those cases where thrombocytopenia or other clinical imperatives preclude delaying treatment till after pregnancy. Conclusion. Hairy cell leukemia is a clonal B-Cell malignancy, for which there is very limited experience worldwide for its management when it occurs during pregnancy. Laparoscopic splenectomy should be considered as a therapeutic option, even with a significantly enlarged spleen, in order to avoid the risks of fetal exposure to chemotherapeutic agents.

This means highly sensitive and specific techniques are increasingly needed to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) in CLL patients. Quantitative MRD levels can be used as prognostic markers, where total MRD eradication is associated with prolonged survival. Nowadays, PCR and flow cytometry techniques used to detect MRD in CLL patients can generate reliable and quantitative results with the highest sensitivity. MRD Flow is based on four-color flow cytometry using specific antibody combinations. For allele specific oligonucleotide real-time quantification (ASO RQ) PCR individual primers are designed to detect a specific immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) rearrangement in each patient clone. Five comprehensive studies investigated and compared the sensitivity and specificity of both methods. Groups of patients receiving different therapies were analyzed at different time points to generate quantitative MRD levels and MRD kinetics. All studies confirmed that both methods generate equivalent results with regard to sensitivity and MRD quantification, although each method has advantages and disadvantages in the daily routine of a standard hematological laboratory. Here, we review these investigations and compare their results in the light of modern therapies.","['Uhrmacher, Sabrina', 'Erdfelder, Felix', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Uhrmacher S', 'Erdfelder F', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100920,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2010/10/05 06:00,2010/10/05 06:01,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2010/272517 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2010;2010. doi: 10.1155/2010/272517.

Moreover, the prognosis of G-CSF-producing gastric cancer has been extremely poor. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old man presented with fatigue and body weight loss. Laboratory testing showed pronounced leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 34900x106/L). Bone marrow aspiration biopsy excluded leukemia and metastatic leukemoid reaction. G-CSF-producing cancer was suspected as the cause of the abnormally elevated serum G-CSF level (293 pg/ml). Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed type 3 gastric cancer, and the biopsy specimens were histologically proven to include moderately to well differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive expression of G-CSF. Abdominal computed tomography showed a lymph node lesion and multiple hepatic metastatic lesions. This patient was diagnosed as having stage IV gastric cancer that produced G-CSF. We treated the patient with 3 chemotherapy regimens, and he survived for almost 2 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of a G-CSF-producing tumor should be investigated in patients who present with severe leukocytosis in the absence of infection. This unusual gastric cancer should be treated as soon as possible after diagnosis.","['Mori, Hiroki', 'Shibuya, Tomoyoshi', 'Osada, Taro', 'Kodani, Tomohiro', 'Higashihara, Yoshie', 'Serizawa, Nobuko', 'Kato, Junko', 'Nagahara, Akihito', 'Ogihara, Tatsuo', 'Watanabe, Sumio']","['Mori H', 'Shibuya T', 'Osada T', 'Kodani T', 'Higashihara Y', 'Serizawa N', 'Kato J', 'Nagahara A', 'Ogihara T', 'Watanabe S']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. hmori@juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukocytosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/secondary', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Stomach Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['881183 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2010 Oct;16(10):CS119-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hematopoietic cells were of mixed lineage, but one type, often erythroid, predominated. Cellular atypia was present in all mice with hematoproliferative change, and dysplasia was present in five of eight examined. Hematoproliferative neoplasia was characterized by similar cytologic features but also resulted in displacement/disruption of normal splenic architecture and increased numbers of unidentified blast cells. One case was differentiated toward myeloid proliferation, suggesting granulocytic leukemia. Affected mice had other neoplasms, such as lymphoma and anemia.

Our results showed that a mutation of C/EBPalpha in one allele was observed in AML after myelodysplastic syndrome, while the 2 alleles are mutated in de novo AML. Unlike an N-terminal frame-shift mutant (C/EBPalpha-N(m))-transduced cells, a C-terminal mutant (C/EBPalpha-C(m))-transduced cells alone induced AML with leukopenia in mice 4-12 months after bone marrow transplantation. Coexpression of both mutants induced AML with marked leukocytosis with shorter latencies. Interestingly, C/EBPalpha-C(m) collaborated with an Flt3-activating mutant Flt3-ITD in inducing AML. Moreover, C/EBPalpha-C(m) strongly blocked myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells, suggesting its class II mutation-like role in leukemogenesis. Although C/EBPalpha-C(m) failed to inhibit transcriptional activity of wild-type C/EBPalpha, it suppressed the synergistic effect between C/EBPalpha and PU.1. On the other hand, C/EBPalpha-N(m) inhibited C/EBPalpha activation in the absence of PU.1, despite low expression levels of p30 protein generated by C/EBPalpha-N(m). Thus, 2 types of C/EBPalpha mutations are implicated in leukemo-genesis, involving different and cooperating molecular mechanisms.","['Kato, Naoko', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Togami, Katsuhiro', 'Nakahara, Fumio', 'Oki, Toshihiko', 'Enomoto, Yutaka', 'Fukuchi, Yumi', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Kato N', 'Kitaura J', 'Doki N', 'Komeno Y', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Togami K', 'Nakahara F', 'Oki T', 'Enomoto Y', 'Fukuchi Y', 'Nakajima H', 'Harada Y', 'Harada H', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100930,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60158-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-270181 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 6;117(1):221-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-270181.

N-Acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme acetylates dipyrone, resulting in a detoxified metabolite. We performed genotyping to identify the distribution of NAT2 polymorphisms in duo samples from mothers and children previously investigated in a case-controlled study of IL. METHODS: Samples from 132 IL, 131 age-matched controls, mothers of cases (n = 86), and mothers of controls (n = 36) were analyzed. PCR-RFLP assays were used to determine the NAT2 variants 191G>A, 282C>T, 341T>C, 481C>T, 590G>A, 803A>G, and 857G>A. The test for case-control differences in the distribution of genotypes was based on chi(2) statistics. Unconditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between maternal exposure to dipyrone during the index pregnancy, IL, and NAT2 phenotypes. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) are given with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: NAT2 slow-acetylation haplotypes were associated with IL (OR, 8.90; 95% CI, 1.71-86.7). An association between IL and NAT2 phenotype was observed in IL whether the mothers reported dipyrone exposures (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.88-10.7) or not (OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.75-10.5). The combination of NAT2 slow/slow (mother/child) phenotypes confers a higher risk of IL (OR, 30.0; 95% CI, 5.87-279.7). CONCLUSION: NAT2 slow-acetylation profiles are associated with IL regardless of maternal exposure to dipyrone during pregnancy. IMPACT: Further recommendations about medicine exposures during pregnancy should take into account that infants with the maternal NAT2 slow-acetylation genotypes might be particularly vulnerable to greater risk.","['Zanrosso, Crisiane Wais', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Goncalves, Bruno Alves de Aguiar', 'Faro, Alessandra', 'Koifman, Sergio', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Zanrosso CW', 'Emerenciano M', 'Goncalves BA', 'Faro A', 'Koifman S', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100930,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '6429L0L52Y (Dipyrone)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (NAT2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*adverse effects', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Dipyrone/*adverse effects', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/04/07 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-10-0508 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0508 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Dec;19(12):3037-43. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0508.

Recent findings indicate that GRN is regulated strongly by the microRNA miR-107, which functionally overlaps with miR-15, miR-16, and miR-195 due to a common 5' sequence critical for target specificity. In this study, we queried whether miR-107 and paralogs regulated GRN in human cancers. In cultured cells, anti-argonaute RNA coimmunoprecipitation with downstream microarray analyses indicates that GRN mRNA is directly targeted by numerous miR-15/107 miRNAs. We further tested this association in human tumors. MiR-15 and miR-16 are known to be downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using pre-existing microarray datasets, we found that GRN expression is higher in CLL relative to nonneoplastic lymphocytes (P < 0.00001). By contrast, other prospective miR-15/miR-16 targets in the dataset (BCL-2 and cyclin D1) were not upregulated in CLL. Unlike in CLL, GRN was not upregulated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) where miR-107 paralogs are not known to be dysregulated. Prior studies have shown that GRN is also upregulated, and miR-107 downregulated, in prostate carcinoma. Our results indicate that multiple members of the miR-107 gene group indeed repress GRN protein levels when transfected into prostate cancer cells. At least a dozen distinct types of cancer have the pattern of increased GRN and decreased miR-107 expression. These findings indicate for the first time that the mitogen and growth factor GRN is dysregulated via the miR-15/107 gene group in multiple human cancers, which may provide a potential common therapeutic target.","['Wang, Wang-Xia', 'Kyprianou, Natasha', 'Wang, Xiaowei', 'Nelson, Peter T']","['Wang WX', 'Kyprianou N', 'Wang X', 'Nelson PT']","['Department of Pathology and Division of Neuropathology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0230, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100930,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MIRN107 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Progranulins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Progranulins', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1684 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1684 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 15;70(22):9137-42. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1684.

Major efforts have thus been made to develop molecules targeting these activated pathways. The mTOR serine/threonine kinase belongs to two separate complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTORC1 pathway is rapamycin sensitive and controls protein translation through the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in most models. In AML, however, the translation process is deregulated and rapamycin resistant. Furthermore, the activity of PI3K/Akt and mTOR is closely related, as mTORC2 activates the oncogenic kinase Akt. We therefore tested, in this study, the antileukemic activity of the dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 compound (Novartis). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The activity of NVP-BEZ235 was tested in primary AML samples (n = 21) and human leukemic cell lines. The different signaling pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. The cap-dependent mRNA translation was studied by 7-methyl-GTP pull-down experiments, polysomal analysis, and [(3)H]leucine incorporation assays. The antileukemic activity of NVP-BEZ235 was tested by analyzing its effects on leukemic progenitor clonogenicity, blast cell proliferation, and survival. RESULTS: The NVP-BEZ235 compound was found to inhibit PI3K and mTORC1 signaling and also mTORC2 activity. Furthermore, NVP-BEZ235 fully inhibits the rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, resulting in a marked inhibition of protein translation in AML cells. Hence, NVP-BEZ235 reduces the proliferation rate and induces an important apoptotic response in AML cells without affecting normal CD34(+) survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show the antileukemic efficiency of the NVP-BEZ235 compound, which therefore represents a promising option for future AML therapies.","['Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Green, Alexa S', 'Vignon, Christine', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Neyret, Aymeric', 'Pannetier, Melanie', 'Willems, Lise', 'Park, Sophie', 'Macone, Alexandre', 'Maira, Sauveur-Michel', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Chapuis N', 'Tamburini J', 'Green AS', 'Vignon C', 'Bardet V', 'Neyret A', 'Pannetier M', 'Willems L', 'Park S', 'Macone A', 'Maira SM', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Herault O', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D']","[""Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS (UMR8104)/INSERM U1016; Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Cochin, AP-HP, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100930,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CRTC2 protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA Caps)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Caps/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-1102 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1102 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 15;16(22):5424-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1102.

In this study, the enhanced cytotoxicity was investigated in the proliferating human AML clonogenic cells by combining FT-L-DOX with ATRA. Also, pharmacokinetic properties by pretreatment of ATRA were evaluated using FR-targeted liposomal calcein (FT-L-Calcein). Pharmacokinetic study showed that the area under the concentration curve (AUC) of FT-L-Calcein was decreased and total clearance was increased by pretreatment with ATRA. Meanwhile, the volume of distribution was significantly increased by pretreatment of ATRA. Moreover, calcein level in the liver, spleen and kidney was increased following intravenous administration of FT-L-Calcein by pretreatment of ATRA. In vitro cytotoxicity of FT-L-DOX was higher than that of CON-L-DOX and was increased by pretreatment with ATRA. Colony formation in AML cells was lower due to treatment with FT-L-DOX compared with CON-L-DOX and colony formation further decreased upon pretreatment with ATRA. Moreover, FT-L-DOX was more toxic to AML clonogenic cells than to AML blast cells. The results demonstrate that the efficiency of FR-mediated targeting of FT-L-DOX was preferentially enhanced by ATRA induced FR-beta upregulation in AML clonogenic cells.","['Li, Hong', 'Lu, Yanhui', 'Piao, Longzhu', 'Wu, Jun', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Ratnam, Manohar', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Li H', 'Lu Y', 'Piao L', 'Wu J', 'Liu S', 'Marcucci G', 'Ratnam M', 'Lee RJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100929,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Folate Receptor 2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Fluoresceins/pharmacokinetics', 'Folate Receptor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/10/05 06:00,2011/03/10 06:00,['2010/10/02 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(10)00720-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2010.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2010 Dec 15;402(1-2):57-63. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2010.09.019.

Homeostasis in this system requires equilibrium between the self-renewal of the stem cells and their capacity of differentiation. Any failure on this equilibrium could lead to fatal consequences, such as the development of leukemia. Due to its rapid rate of renewal, hematopoietic tissue is a major target for antitumoral compounds and often becomes a dose limiting factor in the development of antineoplastics. Our aim was to develop an in vitro model for predicting the efficacy of antitumoral compounds on leukemic cells and their toxic effects on the healthy hematopoietic cells. The mouse myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3b was transduced with a lentiviral vector for expressing the green fluorescence protein. Mixed semisolid clonogenic cultures of transduced WEHI-3b and murine bone marrow cells were exposed to five pharmaceuticals: daunorubicin (positive control), atropine sulphate (negative control) and three in different stages of clinical development (trabectedin, Zalypsis((R)) and PM01183). Colonies of leukemic cells were distinguishable from healthy CFU-GM under fluorescence microscope. The sensitivity of leukemic cells to daunorubicin, trabectedin, Zalypsis((R)) and PM01183 was higher compared to healthy cells. The effect of a non-antitumoral compound, atropine sulphate, was the same on both populations. Our results show that this in vitro model is a valuable tool for studying the effect of antitumoral compounds in both tumoral and normal hematopoietic cells under the same toxic microenvironment and could safe time and facilitate the reduction of the number of animals used in preclinical development of pharmaceuticals.","['Valeri, Antonio', 'Alonso-Ferrero, Maria Eugenia', 'Cerrato, Laura', 'Martinez, Sandra', 'Bueren, Juan A', 'Albella, Beatriz']","['Valeri A', 'Alonso-Ferrero ME', 'Cerrato L', 'Martinez S', 'Bueren JA', 'Albella B']","['CIEMAT, Division of Hematopoiesis.

Some controversy surrounds the question, which of short-term response parameters at which time-point, including complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or major molecular response (MMR) at 6 or 12 months, is the best predictor for treatment outcomes. In this comprehensive analysis, we adopted landmark analysis method, time-dependent Cox's proportional hazard model, and receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) method to analyze time-to-response parameter as predictor of long-term outcomes in 187 chronic phase (CP) CML patients. Regardless of the methods of analysis, earlier achievement of short-term response such as CCyR or MMR could predict the higher probability of achieving better interim outcome (such as treatment failure or loss of response [LOR]). Similar to the findings from other studies, our ROC analysis provided cutoff time points for MMR (18-36 months) and CCyR (6-12 months) that were the best predictors for LOR or treatment failure, which can be an indirect evidence supporting the ELN recommendation. The patient who achieves short-term response rapidly will have a lower risk of losing response or failing after imatinib therapy in CML patients.","[""Kim, Dong Hwan ' Dennis '"", 'Sriharsha, Lakshmi', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Kim DH', 'Sriharsha L', 'Jung CW', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Radich JP', 'Lipton JH']","['Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. drkiim@medimail.co.kr']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",2010/10/01 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21850 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Nov;85(11):856-62. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21850.,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two types of LA that are caused by different mechanisms. Type A is more common, and is caused by the lack of oxygen (tissue hypoxia or hypoperfusion). In this case, impaired cellular respiration leads to lower pH level and at the same time the cells are forced to metabolize glucose anaerobically, which leads to increased production of lactate.

METHODS: Deaths among people living in the municipality of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, between 1998 and 2002 were selected and geocoded, according to selected causes. Over the period evaluated, there were 351 deaths due to liver cancer, 160 due to bladder cancer and 224 due to leukemia, among adults, 25 due to childhood leukemia and 299 due to congenital malformation, in areas close to landfill sites. Buffer zones of radius 2 km around the 15 sites delimited the areas exposed. Standardized mortality ratios for each outcome were analyzed in Bayesian spatial models. RESULTS: In a general manner, the highest values for the standardized mortality ratios were found in more central areas of the municipality, while the landfill sites were located in more peripheral areas. The standardized mortality ratios did not indicate any excess risk for people living in areas close to solid waste landfill sites in the municipality of Sao Paulo. For landfill sites in operation, there was a greater risk of bladder and liver cancer, and death due to congenital malformation, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: No increase in the risk of cancer or congenital malformations was found in areas in the vicinity of urban waste dumps in the municipality of Sao Paulo. The weak associations and the imprecision of the estimates obtained did not allow any causal relationship to be established.","['Gouveia, Nelson', 'Prado, Rogerio Ruscitto do']","['Gouveia N', 'Prado RR']","['Departamento de Medicina, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil. ngouveia@usp.br']","['eng', 'por']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100903,Brazil,Rev Saude Publica,Revista de saude publica,0135043,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Refuse Disposal/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-89102010005000029 [pii]', '10.1590/s0034-89102010005000029 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Saude Publica. 2010 Oct;44(5):859-66. doi: 10.1590/s0034-89102010005000029.

Previous results have shown that Z and F can be efficiently replicated opposite each other by the exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli (KF(-)), although both of them lack Watson-Crick H-bonding ability. We find that exonuclease-inactive T7 DNA polymerase (T7(-)), Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq), and HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) synthesize the nonnatural base pairs A-F, F-A, F-Z, and Z-F with high efficiency, similarly to KF(-). Steady-state kinetics were also measured for T7(-) and the efficiency of insertion is very similar to that of KF(-); interestingly, the replication selectivity with this pair is higher for T7(-) than KF(-), possibly due to a tighter active site. A second group comprised of calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha (Pol alpha) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) was able to replicate the A-F and F-A base pairs to some extent but not the F-Z and the Z-F base pairs. Most of the insertion was recovered when Z was replaced by the nucleoside Q (9-methyl-1-H-imidazo[(4,5)-b]pyridine), which is analogous to Z but possesses a minor groove acceptor nitrogen. This strongly supports the existence of an energetically important hydrogen-bonded interaction between the polymerase and the minor groove at the incipient base pair for these enzymes. A third group, formed by human DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT), failed to replicate the F-Z and Z-F base pairs. No insertion recovery was observed when Z was replaced by Q, possibly indicating that hydrogen bonds are needed at both the template and the triphosphate sites. The results point out the importance of DNA minor groove interactions at the incipient base pair for the activity of some polymerases, and demonstrate the variation in these interactions from enzyme to enzyme.","['Morales, Juan C', 'Kool, Eric T']","['Morales JC', 'Kool ET']","['Contribution from the Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,,,,2000/02/16 00:00,2000/02/16 00:01,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2000/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/16 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja993464+ [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2000 Feb 16;122(6):1001-1007. doi: 10.1021/ja993464+.,['R01 GM052956-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2946118,,,,,,['NIHMS157567'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survivin is highly expressed in embryos and in proliferating adult tissues, but it is not expressed in most differentiated cells. During tumorigenesis, however, survivin expression is dramatically upregulated. Although many studies have shown that survivin is required for cancer cells, the extent to which survivin contributes to the initiation of tumors is unknown. Here we show that transgenic mice that overexpress survivin in hematopoietic cells are at an increased risk of hematologic tumors. In examining how survivin might contribute to tumorigenesis, we observed that hematopoietic cells engineered to overexpress survivin are less susceptible to apoptosis. We conclude that survivin may promote tumorigenesis by imparting a survival advantage to cells that acquire additional genetic lesions.","['Small, S', 'Keerthivasan, G', 'Huang, Z', 'Gurbuxani, S', 'Crispino, J D']","['Small S', 'Keerthivasan G', 'Huang Z', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Crispino JD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Chicago, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Up-Regulation']",2010/10/01 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010198 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.198 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1920-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.198.

CLL cells can be transduced to express CD40 ligand (CD154) using a replication-defective adenovirus vector, thereby cross-linking CD40 on transduced and non-transduced, bystander CLL cells. In a previous study, patients received infusions of autologous CLL cells, transduced to express murine CD154 (mCD154), which induced anti-leukemic immune responses, but also anti-mCD154 antibodies. In this study, we report a phase I study, in which patients were infused with 1 x 10(8), 3 x 10(8) or 1 x 10(9) autologous CLL cells transduced ex vivo to express ISF35, a humanized, membrane-stable CD154. Infusions were well tolerated and consistently followed by reductions in blood lymphocyte counts and lymphadenopathy. After infusion, circulating CLL cells had enhanced or de novo expression of CD95, DR5, p73 and Bid, which enhanced their susceptibility to death-receptor-mediated or drug-induced apoptosis, including CLL cells with deletions at 17p13.1 (del(17p)). Two patients who had CLL with del(17p) had subsequent chemoimmunotherapy and responded well to treatment. In summary, infusions of autologous, ISF35-transduced CLL cells were well tolerated, had biological and clinical activity, and might enhance the susceptibility of CLL cells with del(17p) to chemoimmunotherapy.","['Wierda, W G', 'Castro, J E', 'Aguillon, R', 'Sampath, D', 'Jalayer, A', 'McMannis, J', 'Prussak, C E', 'Keating, M', 'Kipps, T J']","['Wierda WG', 'Castro JE', 'Aguillon R', 'Sampath D', 'Jalayer A', 'McMannis J', 'Prussak CE', 'Keating M', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Leukemia and CLL Research Consortium, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Sequence Deletion', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2010/10/01 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010191 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.191 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1893-900. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.191.

In this series of leukemia patients, 120 patients (70%) did not receive ATG ('no-ATG' group), whereas 51 patients received ATG ('ATG' group). With a median follow-up of 30.3 months, the cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD was 36% in the no-ATG group and 20% in the ATG group (P = 0.11). The cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was significantly lower in the ATG group as compared to the no-ATG group (4 vs 32%, respectively; P = 0.0017). In multivariate analysis, the absence of use of ATG was the strongest parameter associated with an increased risk of extensive chronic GVHD (relative risk) = 7.14, 95% CI: 1.7-33.3, P = 0.008). At 2 years, the probability of nonrelapse mortality, relapse, overall and leukemia-free survivals was not significantly different between the no-ATG and ATG groups. We conclude that the addition of ATG to GVHD prophylaxis resulted in decreased incidence of extensive chronic GVHD without an increase in relapse or nonrelapse mortality, and without compromising survival after myeloablative allo-SCT from HLA-MUD.","['Mohty, M', 'Labopin, M', 'Balere, M L', 'Socie, G', 'Milpied, N', 'Tabrizi, R', 'Ifrah, N', 'Hicheri, Y', 'Dhedin, N', 'Michallet, M', 'Buzyn, A', 'Cahn, J-Y', 'Bourhis, J-H', 'Blaise, D', 'Raffoux, C', 'Esperou, H', 'Yakoub-Agha, I']","['Mohty M', 'Labopin M', 'Balere ML', 'Socie G', 'Milpied N', 'Tabrizi R', 'Ifrah N', 'Hicheri Y', 'Dhedin N', 'Michallet M', 'Buzyn A', 'Cahn JY', 'Bourhis JH', 'Blaise D', 'Raffoux C', 'Esperou H', 'Yakoub-Agha I']","[""Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Hotel-Dieu, Universite de Nantes, CRCNA INSERM U892 and Centre d'Investigation Clinique, Nantes, France. mohamad.mohty@univ-nantes.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*surgery', 'Rabbits', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/10/01 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010200 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.200 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1867-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.200.

We have established a two-reaction real-time PCR assay permitting highly sensitive detection of more than 80 fungal pathogens, covering a large spectrum of moulds, yeasts and Zygomycetes. To assess the clinical potential of the assay, more than 600 consecutive specimens from 125 pediatric patients carrying a high risk of IFD were analyzed. An excellent correlation between PCR positivity and the presence of proven, probable or possible fungal infection according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria was demonstrated, as revealed by the sensitivity of the assay of 96% (95% CI: 82-99%). The negative predictive value of the panfungal PCR assay presented was 98% (95% CI: 90-100%), while the specificity and the positive predictive value were 77% (95% CI: 66-85%) and 62% (95% CI: 47-75%), respectively. The results indicate that molecular screening of patients during febrile neutropenic episodes by the assay presented could help prevent unnecessary toxicity resulting from empirical antifungal treatment in individuals who may not be at risk of imminent fungal disease.

The transplant procedure as performed today takes advantage of HSC trafficking; either egress of HSC from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, that is, mobilization, for acquisition of the hematopoietic graft, and/or trafficking of HSC from the peripheral blood to bone marrow niches in the recipient patient, that is HSC homing. Numerous studies, many of which are reviewed herein, have defined hematopoietic regulatory mechanisms mediated by the 20-carbon lipid family of eicosanoids, and recent evidence strongly supports a role for eicosanoids in regulation of hematopoietic trafficking, adding a new role whereby eicosanoids regulate hematopoiesis. Short-term exposure of HSC to the eicosanoid prostaglandin E(2) increases CXCR4 receptor expression, migration and in vivo homing of HSC. In contrast, cannabinoids reduce hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) CXCR4 expression and induce HPC mobilization when administered in vivo. Leukotrienes have been shown to alter CD34(+) cell adhesion, migration and regulate HSC proliferation, suggesting that eicosanoids have both opposing and complimentary roles in the regulation of hematopoiesis. As numerous FDA approved compounds regulate eicosanoid signaling or biosynthesis, the utility of eicosanoid-based therapeutic strategies to improve hematopoietic transplantation can be rapidly evaluated.","['Hoggatt, J', 'Pelus, L M']","['Hoggatt J', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20100930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Eicosanoids)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cannabinoids/pharmacology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/physiology', 'Eicosanoids/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukotrienes/physiology', 'Yin-Yang']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010216 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.216 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Dec;24(12):1993-2002. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.216.

It shows phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding molecules in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in SHOC2, p.S2G, has been identified as causative for a type of Noonan-like syndrome characterized by the presence of loose anagen hair. In order to understand the contribution of SHOC2 mutations to the clinical manifestations of Noonan syndrome and related disorders, we analyzed SHOC2 in 92 patients with Noonan syndrome and related disorders who did not exhibit PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/2, SOS1 or RAF1 mutations. We found the previously identified p.S2G mutation in eight of our patients. We developed a rapid detection system to identify the p.S2G mutation using melting curve analysis, which will be a useful tool to screen for the apparently common mutation. All the patients with the p.S2G mutation showed short stature, sparse hair and atopic skin. Six of the mutation-positive patients showed severe mental retardation and easily pluckable hair, and one showed leukocytosis. No SHOC2 mutations were identified in leukemia cells from 82 leukemia patients. These results suggest that clinical manifestations in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients partially overlap with those in patients with typical Noonan or CFC syndrome and show that easily pluckable/loose anagen hair is distinctive in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients.","['Komatsuzaki, Shoko', 'Aoki, Yoko', 'Niihori, Tetsuya', 'Okamoto, Nobuhiko', 'Hennekam, Raoul C M', 'Hopman, Saskia', 'Ohashi, Hirofumi', 'Mizuno, Seiji', 'Watanabe, Yoriko', 'Kamasaki, Hotaka', 'Kondo, Ikuko', 'Moriyama, Nobuko', 'Kurosawa, Kenji', 'Kawame, Hiroshi', 'Okuyama, Ryuhei', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Rikiishi, Takeshi', 'Tsuchiya, Shigeru', 'Kure, Shigeo', 'Matsubara, Yoichi']","['Komatsuzaki S', 'Aoki Y', 'Niihori T', 'Okamoto N', 'Hennekam RC', 'Hopman S', 'Ohashi H', 'Mizuno S', 'Watanabe Y', 'Kamasaki H', 'Kondo I', 'Moriyama N', 'Kurosawa K', 'Kawame H', 'Okuyama R', 'Imaizumi M', 'Rikiishi T', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Kure S', 'Matsubara Y']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100930,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SHOC2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Noonan Syndrome/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/03/26 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jhg2010116 [pii]', '10.1038/jhg.2010.116 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2010 Dec;55(12):801-9. doi: 10.1038/jhg.2010.116.

The complete remission rate is increased and survival time is prolonged in APL patients who receive chemotherapy plus ATRA, whereas ATRA syndrome and other ATRA-related adverse effects including pseudo tumor cerebri, headache, severe bone pain, mucosal and skin dryness, hypercholesterolemia, and cheilitis may be observed especially during induction phase of the treatment. In this paper, we report a 9-year-old girl with APL who developed pancarditis while receiving the APL-93 treatment protocol. In our patient, endocarditis and myocarditis were initially determined after ATRA treatment during the induction part of the protocol. All findings disappeared after ATRA was discontinued. When ATRA was readministered in the maintenance part of the treatment protocol, she developed pancarditis and severe pulmonary edema.

The patient received chemotherapy and a subsequent second unrelated allogeneic HSCT, and was free of the disease 3 years after the second HSCT. A molecular study revealed the same rearrangement pattern at IGK@ in both the first relapse and the later relapse, confirming the common origin of the leukemic blasts at different time points. However, a new Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement of TRD@ emerged at the later relapse. A subsequent, more sensitive examination revealed a minor subpopulation with rearrangements at both IGK@ and TRD@, even during the first relapse. This finding suggests that the minor clone, related to the major clone, was present at the first relapse, leading to the later recurrence, even though the major clone at the first relapse had been eradicated by the first allogeneic HSCT. Although a later relapse after allogeneic HSCT is a rare phenomenon, clinicians should keep in mind that later relapses can occur, even after allogeneic HSCT.","['Kato, Keisuke', 'Kobayashi, Chie', 'Kudo, Kazuko', 'Hara, Takashi', 'Masuko, Kyoko', 'Koike, Kazutoshi', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro']","['Kato K', 'Kobayashi C', 'Kudo K', 'Hara T', 'Masuko K', 'Koike K', 'Tsuchida M']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Ibaraki, Japan. k-katou@ibaraki-kodomo.com""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimera', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",2010/10/01 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e7585c [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Oct;32(7):e290-3. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e7585c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPMT is involved in the detoxification and activation of thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, and azathioprine. These drugs are used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 29 sequence variants have been identified so far in the TPMT gene. However, most of these variants are rare and not fully characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel TPMT sequence variant, originally found in a Swedish man of Italian origin. Sequencing of the variable number tandem repeats region of the TPMT promoter and exons III-X revealed a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 611, causing an amino acid substitution from isoleucine to threonine at amino acid 204, positioned in an alpha-helix, approximately 16 A from the active site. This new variant was found in the patient and in his son. Both had intermediate enzyme activity (8.1 U/ml packed red blood cells and 8.8 U/ml packed red blood cells, respectively) and neither carried other variants in the coding region of the gene. To be able to study this variant in more detail, the TPMT*28 variant was expressed in Escherichia coli, and an in-vitro characterization of the variant revealed that the protein was destabilized and showed a stronger tendency towards degradation at 37 degrees C than the wild-type protein. The individuals carrying the TPMT*28 variant had less TPMT protein and lower TPMT activity in both red and white blood cells compared with a wild-type control. CONCLUSIONS: We present a detailed in-vivo and in-vitro characterization of a novel TPMT sequence variant (TPMT*28) causing decreased TPMT activity. Individuals carrying TPMT*28 might have an increased risk for developing severe side effects if treated with conventional doses of thiopurines.","['Appell, Malin Lindqvist', 'Wennerstrand, Patricia', 'Peterson, Curt', 'Hertervig, Erik', 'Martensson, Lars-Goran']","['Appell ML', 'Wennerstrand P', 'Peterson C', 'Hertervig E', 'Martensson LG']","['Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden. malin.lindqvist.appell@liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283402ee4 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2010 Nov;20(11):700-7. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283402ee4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of constitutively active STAT3 has been shown to induce AML cell apoptosis. Our aim was to ascertain if sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, may also inhibit STAT3 signaling and, therefore, be efficacious for AML. We found that sorafenib inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in human AML cell line (HL60) cells. In addition, sorafenib exposure reduced constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in HL60 cells and repressed STAT3 DNA-binding activity and Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression. Similar results were obtained with the Src kinase inhibitor I, suggesting that sorafenib suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation by inhibiting Src-kinase activity. Furthermore, significant inhibition of Src kinase activity by sorafenib was observed in the kinase assay. In addition, Src could be co-immunoprecipitated with STAT3, and the phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly inhibited by sorafenib only in cell lines in which phosphorylated Src is highly expressed. Taken together, our study indicates that sorafenib blocks Src kinase-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and decreases the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, which are associated with increased apoptosis in HL60 cells. These findings provide a rationale for the treatment of human AML.","['Zhao, Wei', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Qu, Bingqian', 'Wu, Xingxin', 'Zhu, Xu', 'Meng, Fanyu', 'Gu, Yanhong', 'Shu, Yongqian', 'Shen, Yan', 'Sun, Yang', 'Xu, Qiang']","['Zhao W', 'Zhang T', 'Qu B', 'Wu X', 'Zhu X', 'Meng F', 'Gu Y', 'Shu Y', 'Shen Y', 'Sun Y', 'Xu Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32833f44fd [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2011 Jan;22(1):79-88. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32833f44fd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous synthesis and structure activity relationship studies of these natural products resulted in the identification of the pharmacophore represented by the structure of cluvenone. In the current study, we examined the anticancer activity of cluvenone and conducted gene expression profiling and pathway analyses. Cluvenone was found to induce apoptosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (EC(5)(0) = 0.25 mumol/L) and had potent growth-inhibitory activity against the NCI60 cell panel, including those that are multidrug-resistant, with a GI(5)(0) range of 0.1 to 2.7 mumol/L. Importantly, cluvenone was approximately 5-fold more potent against a primary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal donors, suggesting that it has significant tumor selectivity. Comparison of cluvenone's growth-inhibitory profile to those in the National Cancer Institute database revealed that compounds with a similar profile to cluvenone were mechanistically unlike known agents, but were associated with cell stress and survival signaling. Gene expression profiling studies determined that cluvenone induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NrF2 stress response pathways. Furthermore, cluvenone was found to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species formation. Lastly, the modulation in the expression of several genes associated with T cell and natural killer cell activation and function by cluvenone suggests a role as an immune-modulator. The current work highlights the potential of cluvenone as a chemotherapeutic agent and provides support for further investigation of these intriguing molecules with regard to mechanism and targets.","['Batova, Ayse', 'Altomare, Diego', 'Chantarasriwong, Oraphin', 'Ohlsen, Kari L', 'Creek, Kim E', 'Lin, You-Chin', 'Messersmith, Amy', 'Yu, Alice L', 'Yu, John', 'Theodorakis, Emmanuel A']","['Batova A', 'Altomare D', 'Chantarasriwong O', 'Ohlsen KL', 'Creek KE', 'Lin YC', 'Messersmith A', 'Yu AL', 'Yu J', 'Theodorakis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. abatova@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100929,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Xanthones)', '0 (cluvenone)', '9749WEV0CA (xanthone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Garcinia/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0517 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0517 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Nov;9(11):2869-78. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0517.

During lactation, the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor (STAT)-5A and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) synergize to induce milk protein expression and also act as survival factors. During involution, STAT3 activation mediates epithelial cell apoptosis and mammary gland remodeling. It has been shown that the administration of glucocorticoids at weaning prevents epithelial cell death, probably by extracellular matrix breakdown prevention. Our results show that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) modulates STAT5A and STAT3 signaling and inhibits apoptosis induction in postlactating mouse mammary glands, only when administered within the first 48 h upon cessation of suckling. DEX administration right after weaning delayed STAT5A inactivation and degradation, preserving gene expression of target genes as beta-casein (bcas) and prolactin induced protein (pip). Weaning-triggered GR down-regulation is also delayed by the hormone treatment. Moreover, DEX administration delayed STAT3 activation and translocation into epithelial cells nuclei. In particular, DEX treatment impaired the increment in gene expression of signal transducer subunit gp130, normally up-regulated from lactation to involution and responsible for STAT3 activation. Therefore, the data shown herein indicate that glucocorticoids are able to modulate early involution by controlling the strong cross talk that GR, STAT5, and STAT3 pathways maintains in the mammary epithelium.","['Bertucci, Paola Y', 'Quaglino, Ana', 'Pozzi, Andrea G', 'Kordon, Edith C', 'Pecci, Adali']","['Bertucci PY', 'Quaglino A', 'Pozzi AG', 'Kordon EC', 'Pecci A']","['Instituto de Fisiologia Biologia y Neurociencias-Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100929,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Lactation/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['en.2010-0517 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2010-0517 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2010 Dec;151(12):5730-40. doi: 10.1210/en.2010-0517.

Previously, we reported that vault RNA (vRNA) has the ability to recognize chemotherapeutic compounds, such as mitoxantrone, based on biophysical and biochemical analyses. In the present study, we show that human glioblastoma-, leukemia-, and osteocarcinoma-derived cell lines overexpress vRNA and exhibit higher resistance toward mitoxantrone. Interestingly, when vRNA expression was suppressed by RNA interference in these cells, the resistance progressively decreased. In agreement with these findings, overexpression of vRNA-1 caused resistance to mitoxantrone. These results suggest a role of vRNA in mitoxantrone resistance in malignant cells and justify further studies on the importance and application of noncoding RNAs in cancer chemotherapeutics.","['Gopinath, Subash C B', 'Wadhwa, Renu', 'Kumar, Penmetcha K R']","['Gopinath SC', 'Wadhwa R', 'Kumar PK']","['RNA Processing Group, Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba City 305-8566, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101008,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0242 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0242 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2010 Nov;8(11):1536-46. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0242.

OBJECTIVE: We performed meta-analyses of occupational cohort studies for five different lymphoma categories: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). DATA EXTRACTION: We assessed three study quality dimensions to evaluate the impact of study quality variations on meta-relative risks (mRRs): stratification by the year of start of follow-up, stratification by the strength of the reported acute myelogenous leukemia association, and stratification by the quality of benzene exposure assessment. DATA SYNTHESIS: mRRs for MM, ALL, and CLL increased with increasing study quality, regardless of the study quality dimension. mRRs for NHL also increased with increasing study quality, although this effect was less pronounced. We observed no association between occupational benzene exposure and HL. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis provides support for an association between occupational benzene exposure and risk of MM, ALL, and CLL. The evidence for an association with NHL is less clear, but this is likely complicated by the etiologic heterogeneity of this group of diseases. Further consideration of the association between benzene and NHL will require delineation of risks by NHL subtype.","['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Lan, Qing', 'Kromhout, Hans', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Lan Q', 'Kromhout H', 'Rothman N', 'Vermeulen R']","['Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100929,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene', 'Hodgkin Disease/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced', 'Multiple Myeloma/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1002318 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2011 Feb;119(2):159-67. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1002318.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, phase 3, nonrandomized trial to determine whether a 3-year estimated overall survival of more than 90% could be maintained with reductions in the duration of therapy and drug doses, using a tumor biology-based therapy assignment. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed, intermediate-risk neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification; these patients included infants (<365 days of age) who had stage 3 or 4 disease, children (>/=365 days of age) who had stage 3 tumors with favorable histopathological features, and infants who had stage 4S disease with a diploid DNA index or unfavorable histopathological features. Patients who had disease with favorable histopathological features and hyperdiploidy were assigned to four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with an incomplete response or either unfavorable feature were assigned to eight cycles. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2005, a total of 479 eligible patients were enrolled in this trial (270 patients with stage 3 disease, 178 with stage 4 disease, and 31 with stage 4S disease). A total of 323 patients had tumors with favorable biologic features, and 141 had tumors with unfavorable biologic features. Ploidy, but not histopathological features, was significantly predictive of the outcome. Severe adverse events without disease progression occurred in 10 patients (2.1%), including secondary leukemia (in 3 patients), death from infection (in 3 patients), and death at surgery (in 4 patients). The 3-year estimate (+/-SE) of overall survival for the entire group was 96+/-1%, with an overall survival rate of 98+/-1% among patients who had tumors with favorable biologic features and 93+/-2% among patients who had tumors with unfavorable biologic features. CONCLUSIONS: A very high rate of survival among patients with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma was achieved with a biologically based treatment assignment involving a substantially reduced duration of chemotherapy and reduced doses of chemotherapeutic agents as compared with the regimens used in earlier trials. These data provide support for further reduction in chemotherapy with more refined risk stratification.

Tissue-specific expression of Ets proteins and their ability to interact with other families of transcription factors contribute to their versatility. In this study, we investigated the regulation of Ets factors in primary human monocytes and macrophages, and their role in matrix metalloprotease (MMP) and cytokine production. The macrophage-activating Toll-like receptor ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced the expression of Ets family members epithelium-specific Ets factor 3 (ESE-3) and TEL-2 but rapidly suppressed Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1) expression. Modulation of FLI-1 expression using either RNA interference or forced expression identified a positive role for FLI-1 in contributing to LPS-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-10, and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Thus, the rapid downregulation of FLI-1 expression after LPS stimulation attenuates the induction of various MMPs and IL-10 under inflammatory conditions. In contrast, the expression of IL-6 and TNFalpha and the effects of interferon (IFN)gamma on LPS responses were not dependent on FLI-1. Our results define a novel FLI-1-mediated self-regulatory feedback loop that limits MMP expression and thus may attenuate extent of tissue destruction associated with inflammatory responses.","['Ho, Hao H', 'Ivashkiv, Lionel B']","['Ho HH', 'Ivashkiv LB']","['Arthritis and Tissue Degeneration Program, Department of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100929,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Down-Regulation/genetics', '*Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics']",2010/10/01 06:00,2011/06/16 06:00,['2010/10/01 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2010.0046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2010 Dec;30(12):893-900. doi: 10.1089/jir.2010.0046.

In our study, chimeric (c) divalent (cHD37) and tetravalent (cHD37-DcVV) anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were constructed, expressed and evaluated for their binding to human 19-positive (CD19(+)) tumor cell lines. They were also tested for proapoptotic activity and the ability to mediate effector functions. The antitumor activity of these MAbs was further tested in mice xenografted with the CD19(+) Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi or the pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, NALM-6. The cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs exhibited specific binding and comparable proapoptotic activity on CD19(+) tumor cell lines in vitro. In addition, the cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs were similar in their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). However, the tetravalent cHD37-DcVV MAb bound more avidly, had a slower dissociation rate, and did not internalize as well. It also had enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with human but not murine effector cells. The cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs exhibited comparable affinity for the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and similar pharmacokinetics (PKs) in mice. Moreover, all the HD37 constructs were similar in extending the survival of mice xenografted with Daudi or NALM-6 tumor cells. Therefore, the cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs have potent antitumor activity and should be further developed for use in humans. Although not evident in mice, due to its increased ability to mediate ADCC with human but not mouse effector cells, the cHD37-DcVV MAb should have superior therapeutic efficacy in humans.","['Liu, Xiao-Yun', 'Pop, Laurentiu M', 'Tsai, Lydia', 'Pop, Iliodora V', 'Vitetta, Ellen S']","['Liu XY', 'Pop LM', 'Tsai L', 'Pop IV', 'Vitetta ES']","['The Cancer Immunobiology Center, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Texas 75390-8576, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101116,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/chemistry/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25695 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Jul 15;129(2):497-506. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25695.

Considering the potential great medical and social relevance of this discovery, we investigated whether this finding could be confirmed in an independent group of Dutch sporadic PrCa cases. METHODS: We investigated the occurrence of XMRV in fresh-frozen PrCa specimens of 74 PrCa patients from The Netherlands. Total RNA and DNA were isolated, subjected to cDNA synthesis, and analyzed by real-time PCR targeting conserved XMRV sequences. RESULTS: Spiking experiments showed that we were able to detect at least 10 copies of XMRV sequences in 100,000 cells by real-time PCR, demonstrating high sensitivity of the assay. XMRV sequences were detected in 3 out of 74 (i.e., 4%) PrCa specimens. The number of XMRV containing cells was extremely low (1 in 600-7,000 cells). This was corroborated by the fact that XMRV could not be detected in consecutive tissue sections of the initial XMRV-positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: XMRV was rarely detected, and at extremely low levels, in sporadic PrCa samples from Dutch patients. When XMRV would play a causal role in prostate carcinogenesis, integration of the provirus could be expected to be present in, at least, a proportion of tumor cells. Therefore, our data do not support the claim that there is an association between XMRV infection and PrCa in Dutch PrCa patients.","['Verhaegh, Gerald W', 'de Jong, Arjan S', 'Smit, Frank P', 'Jannink, Sander A', 'Melchers, Willem J G', 'Schalken, Jack A']","['Verhaegh GW', 'de Jong AS', 'Smit FP', 'Jannink SA', 'Melchers WJ', 'Schalken JA']","['Department of Urology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100928,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*isolation & purification']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pros.21255 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2011 Mar 1;71(4):415-20. doi: 10.1002/pros.21255.

A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy-number variations (CNVs) of C8orf4 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. However, the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amount of clinical samples. The purpose of this study is to confirm the relationship between C8orf4 CNVs and hematological malignancies. In our study, we collected bone marrow samples from 515 hematological malignancies and 102 healthy controls. And the CNVs of C8orf4 were detected by real-time PCR. We found significant association between the copy-number deletions of C8orf4 and the risk of these hematological malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We also found that the expression of C8orf4 mRNA was relatively lower in the samples with 1 copy of DNA than those with 2 copies of DNA. The CNVs of C8orf4 were associated with the risk of hematological malignancies.","['Zhang, Jiahao', 'Gao, Yan', 'Zhao, Xiaosu', 'Guan, Ming', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wan, Jun', 'Yu, Bo']","['Zhang J', 'Gao Y', 'Zhao X', 'Guan M', 'Zhang W', 'Wan J', 'Yu B']","['Worldwide Medical Center, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100929,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TCIM protein, human)']",IM,"['*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics']",2010/09/30 06:00,2012/08/23 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9698-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28 Suppl 1:S647-52. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9698-6.

In the present work, we investigated genotoxic effect of BisGMA on human lymphocytes and human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM) cells. Our results indicate that BisGMA is genotoxic for human lymphocytes. The compound induced DNA damage evaluated by the alkaline, neutral, and pH 12.1 version of the comet assay. This damage included oxidative modifications of the DNA bases, as checked by DNA repair enzymes EndoIII and Fpg, alkali-labile sites and DNA double-strand breaks. BisGMA induced DNA-strand breaks in the isolated plasmid. Lymphocytes incubated with BisGMA at 1 mM were able to remove about 50% of DNA damage during 120-min repair incubation. The monomer at 1 mM evoked a delay of the cell cycle in the S phase in CCRF-CEM cells. The experiment with spin trap-DMPO demonstrated that BisGMA induced reactive oxygen species, which were able to damage DNA. BisGMA is able to induce a broad spectrum of DNA damage including severe DNA double-strand breaks, which can be responsible for a delay of the cell cycle in the S phase.","['Drozdz, Kinga', 'Wysokinski, Daniel', 'Krupa, Renata', 'Wozniak, Katarzyna']","['Drozdz K', 'Wysokinski D', 'Krupa R', 'Wozniak K']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100929,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '454I75YXY0 (Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Plasmids', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects']",2010/09/30 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-010-0593-x [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2011 Nov;85(11):1453-61. doi: 10.1007/s00204-010-0593-x.

Rationale, design, and methods].",647-51,10.1007/s00063-010-1105-8 [doi],"Non-modified human immunoglobulins (IgG) are standard of care for replacement therapy with primary (inherited) immunodeficiencies, and secondary immunodeficiencies due to multiple myeloma (MM) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Further, they have effectively been used as immunomodulation in neurological autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). A variety of IgG preparations for intravenous and subcutaneous use are available. In view of the broad range of indications, data on the utilization of the IgG preparations in everyday clinical care are of high clinical interest. Furthermore, data on the outcomes of IgG therapy outside the setting of controlled clinical trials are needed. Therefore, the SIGNS study (Assessment of Immunoglobulins in a Long-Term Non-Interventional Study) was set up as a non-interventional prospective open-label cohort study and was approved by the ethics committee. Led by an interdisciplinary steering board, hospital- and office-based investigators in 30-40 centers throughout Germany (neurologists, pediatricians, oncologists, other) will document approximately 300 patients, and will follow them for at least 2 years. Patients of both genders and any age are eligible if they have received, or are scheduled for, IgG therapy for primary or severe secondary immunodeficiency or neurological autoimmune diseases, and have provided written informed consent. No exclusion criteria have been defined in order to minimize selection bias. Long-term outcome data will be collected on patient characteristics in the various indications, drug utilization (e.g., treatment and dosing patterns), effectiveness (i.e., number of infections), tolerability, health-related quality of life, and economic variables (number of hospitalizations, sick-leave days, etc.) with the possibility to estimate direct costs. For the neurological autoimmune diseases, detailed data will be gathered, among others, on neurological function, muscular function, physical function (grip strength, INCAT disability scale, etc.) and stabilization or progression of symptoms over time. Data collection in SIGNS is performed using a secure internet site and an MySQL database. A number of quality measures are routinely performed including automated plausibility checks at data entry, queries, and on-site monitoring with source data verification. It is expected that SIGNS will contribute to optimization of therapy in this diverse patient population.","['Kirch, Wilhelm', 'Gold, Ralf', 'Hensel, Manfred', 'Fasshauer, Maria', 'Pittrow, David', 'Huscher, Dorte', 'Reiser, Marcel', 'Stangel, Martin', 'Baumann, Ulrich', 'Borte, Michael']","['Kirch W', 'Gold R', 'Hensel M', 'Fasshauer M', 'Pittrow D', 'Huscher D', 'Reiser M', 'Stangel M', 'Baumann U', 'Borte M']","['Institut fur Klinische Pharmakologie, Medizinische Fakultat, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

The 516G>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4 of CYP2B6 gene may change CYP2B6 enzyme activity and the gene expression in the liver. Carcinogens' failure to be degraded by CYP2B6 may cause DNA injury and cancer. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association between genotype or allele of CYP2B6 516G>T SNP and acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We recruited 300 patients including 164 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 96 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, including 17 cases of T-ALL and 79 cases of B-ALL), 40 cases of MDS, as well as 348 unrelated umbilical cord blood as the controls. Karyotype analysis and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine different recurrent genetic abnormalities in these cases. Genotype of CYP2B6 516G>T SNP was determined by allele-specific primers PCR, and confirmed by gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The GT and GT + TT genotype frequencies of c.516G>T SNP were higher in ALL (37.5% and 42.7%, respectively, P < 0.01), and AML (37.2% and 40.9%, respectively, P < 0.01) than in control (23.9% and 25.9%, respectively). In the subtypes of acute leukemias, the GT + TT genotype frequency was significantly higher in AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (41.7%, p < 0.05), in AML-NOS (40.6%, p < 0.01), in acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (48.3%, p < 0.01), and in T-ALL (70.6%, p < 0.01) as compared with those in the controls. The frequency of CYP2B6 516 T allele was higher in AML (22.3%, p < 0.01) and ALL (24.0%, p < 0.01) compared with cord blood (13.9%). In different types of acute leukemias, CYP2B6 516 T allele frequency was significantly higher in AML with AML1-ETO (19.2%, p < 0.05), AML-NOS (22.7%, p < 0.01), acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (25.9%, p < 0.01), and T-ALL (38.2%, p < 0.01). MDS was unrelated to the genotype and allele frequencies of c.516G>T SNP in CYP2B6. T allele of CYP2B6 516G>T SNP may be one of the risk factors predisposing to the pathogenesis of a majority of ALL and AML, but has no relationship with B-ALL and leukemia with or without chromosome abnormalities.","['Yuan, Zhong-hai', 'Liu, Qian', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Liu, Hong-xing', 'Zhao, Jun', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Yuan ZH', 'Liu Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu HX', 'Zhao J', 'Zhu P']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2B6 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/*genetics', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/03/31 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1085-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Mar;90(3):293-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1085-z.

Cells from a cohort of 25 CLL patients were incubated for 72 h with each of these three agents, at 3 concentrations, both with and without thalidomide. Cell viability was assessed using the Annexin V:FITC assay. Fludarabine was highly toxic to the cells, producing very high levels of cell death; however, thalidomide did not increase this effect. Cyclophosphamide combined with thalidomide showed a small, non-significant improvement in toxicity compared with monotherapy. Median cell death for 5 microM dexamethasone monotherapy and for combination with thalidomide was 15% [interquartile range (IQR) 0-38%] and 17% (IQR 0-54%), respectively (Wilcoxon Signed Rank analysis, p=0.034).

It also undergoes mutations in 60% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases with normal karyotype. The incidence and significance of NPM1 deletion in human leukemia have not been elucidated. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bone marrow samples from 145 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML were included in this study. Cytogenetically 43 cases had isolated 5q-, 84 cases had 5q- plus other changes and 18 cases had complex karyotype without 5q deletion. FISH and direct sequencing investigated the NPM1 gene. NPM1 deletion was an uncommon event in the ""5q- syndrome"" but occurred in over 40% of cases with high risk MDS/AML with complex karyotypes and 5q loss. It originated from large 5q chromosome deletions. Simultaneous exon 12 mutations were never found. NPM1 gene status was related to the pattern of complex cytogenetic aberrations. NPM1 haploinsufficiency was significantly associated with monosomies (p<0.001) and gross chromosomal rearrangements, i.e., markers, rings, and double minutes (p<0.001), while NPM1 disomy was associated with structural changes (p=0.013). Interestingly, in complex karyotypes with 5q- TP53 deletion and/or mutations are not specifically associated with NPM1 deletion. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: NPM1/5q35 deletion is a consistent event in MDS/AML with a 5q-/-5 in complex karyotypes. NPM1 deletion and NPM1 exon 12 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive and are associated with two distinct cytogenetic subsets of MDS and AML.","['La Starza, Roberta', 'Matteucci, Caterina', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Brandimarte, Lucia', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Crescenzi, Barbara', 'Nofrini, Valeria', 'Rosati, Roberto', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Santucci, Antonella', 'Berchicci, Laura', 'Arcioni, Francesco', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Martelli, Massimo Fabrizio', 'Sambani, Constantina', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['La Starza R', 'Matteucci C', 'Gorello P', 'Brandimarte L', 'Pierini V', 'Crescenzi B', 'Nofrini V', 'Rosati R', 'Gottardi E', 'Saglio G', 'Santucci A', 'Berchicci L', 'Arcioni F', 'Falini B', 'Martelli MF', 'Sambani C', 'Aventin A', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012855 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Sep 21;5(9):e12855. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012855.,,PMC2943467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we introduced a transendothelial route of delivery in order to increase tumor accumulation of virus particles (vp) beyond that resulting from convection-dependent extravasation alone. This was achieved by engineering an Ad encoding a syncytium-forming protein, gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) fusogenic membrane glycoprotein (FMG). The expression of GALV was regulated by a hybrid viral enhancer-human promoter construct comprising the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early enhancer and the minimal human endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase promoter (""eTie1""). Endothelial cell-selectivity of the resulting Ad-eTie1-GALV vector was demonstrated by measuring GALV mRNA transcript levels. Furthermore, Ad-eTie1-GALV selectively induced fusion between infected endothelial cells and uninfected epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, allowing transendothelial virus penetration. Heterofusion of infected endothelium to human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells, in mixed in vitro cultures or in murine xenograft models, permitted fusion-dependent transactivation of the replication-deficient Ad-eTie1-GALV, due to enabled access to viral E1 proteins derived from the HEK 293 cytoplasm. These data provide evidence to support our proposed use of GALV to promote Ad penetration through tumor-associated vasculature, an approach that may substantially improve the efficiency of systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses to disseminated tumors.","['Chen, Hannah H', 'Cawood, Ryan', 'El-Sherbini, Yasser', 'Purdie, Laura', 'Bazan-Peregrino, Miriam', 'Seymour, Leonard W', 'Carlisle, Robert C']","['Chen HH', 'Cawood R', 'El-Sherbini Y', 'Purdie L', 'Bazan-Peregrino M', 'Seymour LW', 'Carlisle RC']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (immediate-early proteins, cytomegalovirus)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Fusion/*methods', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism/virology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/genetics/metabolism', 'Giant Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/therapy/virology', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Virion', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32355-3 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2010.209 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2011 Jan;19(1):67-75. doi: 10.1038/mt.2010.209.

We present a pooled analysis based on primary data from studies on residential magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia published after 2000. METHODS: Seven studies with a total of 10,865 cases and 12,853 controls were included. The main analysis focused on 24-h magnetic field measurements or calculated fields in residences. RESULTS: In the combined results, risk increased with increase in exposure, but the estimates were imprecise. The odds ratios for exposure categories of 0.1-0.2 muT, 0.2-0.3 muT and >/=0.3 muT, compared with <0.1 muT, were 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.41), 1.16 (0.69-1.93) and 1.44 (0.88-2.36), respectively. Without the most influential study from Brazil, the odds ratios increased somewhat. An increasing trend was also suggested by a nonparametric analysis conducted using a generalised additive model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in line with previous pooled analyses showing an association between magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia. Overall, the association is weaker in the most recently conducted studies, but these studies are small and lack methodological improvements needed to resolve the apparent association. We conclude that recent studies on magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia do not alter the previous assessment that magnetic fields are possibly carcinogenic.","['Kheifets, L', 'Ahlbom, A', 'Crespi, C M', 'Draper, G', 'Hagihara, J', 'Lowenthal, R M', 'Mezei, G', 'Oksuzyan, S', 'Schuz, J', 'Swanson, J', 'Tittarelli, A', 'Vinceti, M', 'Wunsch Filho, V']","['Kheifets L', 'Ahlbom A', 'Crespi CM', 'Draper G', 'Hagihara J', 'Lowenthal RM', 'Mezei G', 'Oksuzyan S', 'Schuz J', 'Swanson J', 'Tittarelli A', 'Vinceti M', 'Wunsch Filho V']","['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA School of Public Health, 650 Charles Young Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. kheifets@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['6605838 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605838 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Sep 28;103(7):1128-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605838.,"['P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2965855,,,,,,,,,,['Br J Cancer. 2010 Sep 28;103(7):931-2.

METHODS: We report a national case-control study relating childhood cancer risk to the average magnetic field from high-voltage overhead power lines at the child's home address at birth during the year of birth, estimated using National Grid records. From the National Registry of Childhood Tumours, we obtained records of 28,968 children born in England and Wales during 1962-1995 and diagnosed in Britain under age 15. We selected controls from birth registers, matching individually by sex, period of birth, and birth registration district. No participation by cases or controls was required. RESULTS: The estimated relative risk for each 0.2 muT increase in magnetic field was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.57 to 2.32) for leukaemia, 0.80 (0.43-1.51) for CNS/brain tumours, and 1.34 (0.84-2.15) for other cancers. CONCLUSION: Although not statistically significant, the estimate for childhood leukaemia resembles results of comparable studies. Assuming causality, the estimated attributable risk is below one case per year. Magnetic-field exposure during the year of birth is unlikely to be the whole cause of the association with distance from overhead power lines that we previously reported.","['Kroll, M E', 'Swanson, J', 'Vincent, T J', 'Draper, G J']","['Kroll ME', 'Swanson J', 'Vincent TJ', 'Draper GJ']","['University of Oxford, Childhood Cancer Research Group, Richards Building, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LG, UK. mary.kroll@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'England', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Wales']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['6605795 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605795 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Sep 28;103(7):1122-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605795.,['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],PMC2965853,,,,,,,,,,['Br J Cancer. 2010 Sep 28;103(7):931-2.

RNA sequencing of leukemic myeloblasts or CD34(+) cells pooled from healthy donors showed that 472 miRNAs were expressed, including 7 novel miRNAs, some of which displayed differential expression. Sequencing of all known miRNA genes revealed several novel germline polymorphisms but no acquired mutations in the leukemia genome. Analysis of the sequence of the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of all coding genes identified a single somatic mutation in the 3'-UTR of TNFAIP2, a known target of the PML-RARalpha oncogene.

Occasionally, AID can target non-Ig genes and thereby promote GC B-cell lymphomagenesis. We recently showed that the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 kinase induces aberrant expression of AID in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoid chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis. To elucidate the biological significance of aberrant AID expression, we studied loss of AID function in a murine model of BCR-ABL1 ALL. Mice transplanted with BCR-ABL1-transduced AID(-/-) bone marrow had prolonged survival compared with mice transplanted with leukemia cells generated from AID(+/+) bone marrow. Consistent with a causative role of AID in genetic instability, AID(-/-) leukemia had a lower frequency of amplifications and deletions and a lower frequency of mutations in non-Ig genes, including Pax5 and Rhoh compared with AID(+/+) leukemias. AID(-/-) and AID(+/+) ALL cells showed a markedly distinct gene expression pattern, and AID(-/-) ALL cells failed to downregulate a number of tumor-suppressor genes including Rhoh, Cdkn1a (p21), and Blnk (SLP65). We conclude that AID accelerates clonal evolution in BCR-ABL1 ALL by enhancing genetic instability and aberrant somatic hypermutation, and by negative regulation of tumor-suppressor genes.","['Gruber, Tanja Andrea', 'Chang, Mi Sook', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Gruber TA', 'Chang MS', 'Sposto R', 'Muschen M']","['Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genes, abl', 'Genes, p53', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1438 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1438 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Oct 1;70(19):7411-20. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1438.

These observations lend compelling weight to the application of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in the therapy of T-ALL. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, an orally bioavailable imidazoquinoline derivative, which has entered clinical trials for solid tumors, on both T-ALL cell lines and patient samples. NVP-BEZ235 was cytotoxic to a panel of T-ALL cell lines as determined by MTT assays. NVP-BEZ235 treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blots showed a dose- and time-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and mTORC1 downstream targets in response to NVP-BEZ235. Remarkably, NVP-BEZ235 targeted the side population of both T-ALL cell lines and patient lymphoblasts, which might correspond to leukemia-initiating cells, and synergized with chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dexamethasone) currently used for treating T-ALL patients. NVP-BEZ235 reduced chemoresistance to vincristine induced in Jurkat cells by coculturing with MS-5 stromal cells, which mimic the bone marrow microenvironment. NVP-BEZ235 was cytotoxic to T-ALL patient lymphoblasts displaying pathway activation, where the drug dephosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, at variance with rapamycin. Taken together, our findings indicate that longitudinal inhibition at two nodes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network with NVP-BEZ235, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, may be an efficient treatment of those T-ALLs that have aberrant upregulation of this signaling pathway for their proliferation and survival.","['Chiarini, Francesca', 'Grimaldi, Cecilia', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Ognibene, Andrea', 'Battistelli, Michela', 'Falcieri, Elisabetta', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Pagliaro, Pasqualepaolo', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Chiarini F', 'Grimaldi C', 'Ricci F', 'Tazzari PL', 'Evangelisti C', 'Ognibene A', 'Battistelli M', 'Falcieri E', 'Melchionda F', 'Pession A', 'Pagliaro P', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Quinolines/*therapeutic use', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1814 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1814 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Oct 15;70(20):8097-107. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1814.

We have described a patient with thrombocytopenia and impaired agonist-induced platelet aggregation, secretion, and glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa activation, associated with a RUNX1 mutation. Platelet myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and transcript levels of its gene MYL9 were decreased. Myosin IIA and MLC phosphorylation are important in platelet responses to activation and regulate thrombopoiesis by a negative regulatory effect on premature proplatelet formation. We addressed the hypothesis that MYL9 is a transcriptional target of RUNX1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using megakaryocytic cells revealed RUNX1 binding to MYL9 promoter region -729/-542 basepairs (bp), which contains 4 RUNX1 sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed RUNX1 binding to each site. In transient ChIP assay, mutation of these sites abolished binding of RUNX1 to MYL9 promoter construct. In reporter gene assays, deletion of each RUNX1 site reduced activity. MYL9 expression was inhibited by RUNX1 short interfering RNA (siRNA) and enhanced by RUNX1 overexpression. RUNX1 siRNA decreased cell spreading on collagen and fibrinogen. Our results constitute the first evidence that the MYL9 gene is a direct target of RUNX1 and provide a mechanism for decreased platelet MYL9 expression, MLC phosphorylation, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction associated with RUNX1 mutations.","['Jalagadugula, Gauthami', 'Mao, Guangfen', 'Kaur, Gurpreet', 'Goldfinger, Lawrence E', 'Dhanasekaran, Danny N', 'Rao, A Koneti']","['Jalagadugula G', 'Mao G', 'Kaur G', 'Goldfinger LE', 'Dhanasekaran DN', 'Rao AK']","['Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100927,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myosin Light Chains/*genetics/metabolism', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Thrombocytopenia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60894-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-289850 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):6037-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-289850.

To evaluate the impact of recent improvements in chemotherapy and transplantation, we performed a similar analysis on patients treated in the following decade. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 610 patients with Ph-positive ALL treated between 1995 and 2005 without tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. The median follow-up duration was 6.3 years. RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 89% of patients. The 7-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were superior in the present cohort compared with the previous cohort (32.0% +/- 2.0% v 25.0% +/- 3.0, respectively, P = .007; and 44.9% +/- 2.2% v 36.0% +/- 3.0%, respectively, P = .017). Compared with chemotherapy alone, transplantation with matched related donors or unrelated donors in first remission (325 patients) showed an advantage with increasing follow-up, suggesting greater protection against late relapses (hazard ratio at 5 years, 0.37; P < .001). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis accounting for treatment (transplantation v no transplantation), age, leukocyte count, and early response had independent impact on treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcome of children and adolescents with Ph-positive ALL has improved with advances in transplantation and chemotherapy. Transplantations with matched related donors and unrelated donors were equivalent and offered better disease control compared with chemotherapy alone. Age, leukocyte count, and early treatment response were independent prognostic indicators. The results of this study will serve as a historical reference to evaluate the therapeutic impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the outcome of Ph-positive ALL.","['Arico, Maurizio', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Galimberti, Stefania', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Arico M', 'Schrappe M', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Conter V', 'Galimberti S', 'Manabe A', 'Saha V', 'Baruchel A', 'Vettenranta K', 'Horibe K', 'Benoit Y', 'Pieters R', 'Escherich G', 'Silverman LB', 'Pui CH', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A nested case-control design was used to select patients enrolled onto the MA.27 phase III trial comparing anastrozole with exemestane. Cases were matched to two controls and were defined as patients with grade 3 or 4 MS-AEs (according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) or those who discontinued treatment for any grade of MS-AE within the first 2 years. Genotyping was performed with the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. RESULTS: The GWAS included 293 cases and 585 controls. A total of 551,358 SNPs were analyzed, followed by imputation and fine mapping of a region of interest on chromosome 14. Four SNPs on chromosome 14 had the lowest P values (2.23E-06 to 6.67E-07). T-cell leukemia 1A (TCL1A) was the gene closest (926-7000 bp) to the four SNPs. Functional genomic studies revealed that one of these SNPs (rs11849538) created an estrogen response element and that TCL1A expression was estrogen dependent, was associated with the variant SNP genotypes in estradiol-treated lymphoblastoid cells transfected with estrogen receptor alpha and was directly related to interleukin 17 receptor A (IL17RA) expression. CONCLUSION: This GWAS identified SNPs associated with MS-AEs in women treated with AIs and with a gene (TCL1A) which, in turn, was related to a cytokine (IL17). These findings provide a focus for further research to identify patients at risk for MS-AEs and to explore the mechanisms for these adverse events.","['Ingle, James N', 'Schaid, Daniel J', 'Goss, Paul E', 'Liu, Mohan', 'Mushiroda, Taisei', 'Chapman, Judy-Anne W', 'Kubo, Michiaki', 'Jenkins, Gregory D', 'Batzler, Anthony', 'Shepherd, Lois', 'Pater, Joseph', 'Wang, Liewei', 'Ellis, Matthew J', 'Stearns, Vered', 'Rohrer, Daniel C', 'Goetz, Matthew P', 'Pritchard, Kathleen I', 'Flockhart, David A', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Weinshilboum, Richard M']","['Ingle JN', 'Schaid DJ', 'Goss PE', 'Liu M', 'Mushiroda T', 'Chapman JA', 'Kubo M', 'Jenkins GD', 'Batzler A', 'Shepherd L', 'Pater J', 'Wang L', 'Ellis MJ', 'Stearns V', 'Rohrer DC', 'Goetz MP', 'Pritchard KI', 'Flockhart DA', 'Nakamura Y', 'Weinshilboum RM']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. ingle.james@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100927,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (IL17RA protein, human)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-17)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Triazoles)', '2Z07MYW1AZ (Anastrozole)', 'NY22HMQ4BX (exemestane)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anastrozole', 'Androstadienes/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Aromatase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Estrogens/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Musculoskeletal System/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nitriles/adverse effects', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Postmenopause', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-17/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Triazoles/adverse effects']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/11/10 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.5064 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.5064 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Nov 1;28(31):4674-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.5064.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of the imaging histories of 150 pediatric oncology patients (30 each in 5 subgroups, that is, leukemia, lymphomas, brain tumors, neuroblastomas, and assorted solid tumors) for 5 years after diagnosis was performed. All procedures involving ionizing radiation were recorded, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine (NM) studies, fluoroscopy, and interventional procedures. CED estimates were calculated. RESULTS: Individual CED estimates ranged from <1 mSv to 642 mSv, with a median of 61 mSv. CT and NM were the greatest contributors; CT constituted 30% of procedures but 52% of the total CED, and NM constituted 20% and 46%, respectively. There was considerable variability between tumor subgroups. CED estimates were highest in the neuroblastoma (median: 213 mSv [range: 36-489 mSv]) and lymphoma (median: 191 mSv [range: 10-642 mSv]) groups and lowest in the leukemia group (median: 5 mSv [range: 0.2-57 mSv]).

Relative quantification mass spectrometry was employed to identify pathways affected by Tel/PDGFRbeta, an oncogene associated with myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN). Its effects on over 1800 proteins were quantified with high confidence. Of those up-regulated by Tel/PDGFRbeta several were involved in the interferon gamma (IFNgamma) response. To validate these observations we employed embryonic and myeloid stem cells models which revealed Tel/PDGFRbeta-induced STAT1 up-regulation and activation was responsible for modulating the interferon response. A STAT1 target highly up-regulated was ICSBP, a transcriptional regulator of myeloid and eosinophilic differentiation. ICSBP interacts with CBP/p300 and Ets transcription factors, to promote transcription of additional genes, including the Egr family, key regulators of myelopoiesis. These interferon responses were recapitulated using IFNgamma stimulation of stem cells. Thus Tel/PDGFRbeta induces aberrant IFN signaling and downstream targets, which may ultimately impact the hematopoietic transcriptional factor network to bias myelomonocytic differentiation in this MPN.","['Dobbin, E', 'Graham, C', 'Freeburn, R W', 'Unwin, R D', 'Griffiths, J R', 'Pierce, A', 'Whetton, A D', 'Wheadon, H']","['Dobbin E', 'Graham C', 'Freeburn RW', 'Unwin RD', 'Griffiths JR', 'Pierce A', 'Whetton AD', 'Wheadon H']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 0YN, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100826,England,Stem Cell Res,Stem cell research,101316957,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1873-5061(10)00093-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.scr.2010.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Res. 2010 Nov;5(3):226-43. doi: 10.1016/j.scr.2010.08.001.

Cases with the PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene can involve a diagnostic dilemma for the following reasons: (1) the fusion gene occurs very rarely, (2) the cases do not have a distinct myeloid or lymphoid morphology and cells often appear immature, (3) cases usually have a mixed T-cell and myeloid phenotype, and (4) cases often have a mixed clinical presentation (e.g., mediastinal mass in a patient with AML). A 27-year-old woman was diagnosed with AML with the PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene. The patient was treated on an AML regimen and achieved a complete remission. Although the reported treatment of these patients varies greatly, outcome remains very poor in the vast majority. Furthermore, central nervous system involvement at diagnosis and relapse are reported in pediatric populations. Routine acute leukemia fluorescence in situ hybridization panels do not include a probe for the PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene, and therefore diagnosis can be made only when karyotyping is available; that delay can result in initial misdiagnosis and mistreatment.

In 73 patients, the AML diagnosis was preceded by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML), in 31 patients by an antecedent hematologic disease, and in 57 patients by treatment with chemotherapy and/or irradiation (t-AML). Cytogenetic analysis was carried out in 93%, of which 61% had clonal chromosome aberrations. MDS-AML correlated to a normal karyotype (P < 0.001). t-AML correlated to abnormal clones with numerical and structural aberrations (P = 0.03), five or more unrelated aberrations (P = 0.03), marker chromosomes (P = 0.006), abnormal mitoses only (P = 0.01), female sex (P < 0.001), and -7 (P = 0.006). Centromeric breakage correlated to a complex karyotype (P = 0.01). The frequencies of aberrations in s-AML patients were compared with an age-matched group of de novo AML patients diagnosed in the same area and period. In this comparison, s-AML only correlated to -7 (P = 0.02).

Analysis of 16 additional diagnostic NK AML samples revealed no evidence of submicroscopic aberrations undetected by conventional cytogenetics in any case. These results favor evolution of NK AML leukemia cells with acquisition of novel genetic changes as the most common etiology of AK AML relapse as opposed to secondary leukemogenesis.

In the present study, we identified the CLCA2 gene as a novel fusion partner of RUNX1 in a case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(1;21)(p22;q22). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing revealed that the t(1;21) results in out-of-frame RUNX1-CLCA2 fusions. Alternative splicing generates at least six fusion transcripts, including a major transcript fusing RUNX1 exon 6 with CLCA2 exon 2. These out-of-frame fusions produce putative truncated RUNX1 isoforms retaining the DNA binding Runt domain but not the transcriptional regulatory domain of RUNX1. No mutations were found in the exons encoding the Runt and C-terminal domains of the nonrearranged RUNX1 gene. Similar to truncated RUNX1 isoforms previously described, these shortened products could act as dominant negative inhibitors of RUNX1-dependent transactivation. CLCA2 is a breast tumor suppressor gene that encodes a member of the calcium-activated chloride channel family and is involved for the first time in a chromosomal translocation. The RUNX1-CLCA2 fusion is another example of out-of-frame fusion generating truncated RUNX1 isoforms that represent a recurrent molecular mechanism in RUNX1-related leukemias.","['Giguere, Amelie', 'Hebert, Josee']","['Giguere A', 'Hebert J']","['Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank and Hematology-Oncology Division, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (CLCA2 protein, human)', '0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloride Channels/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/10/13 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00405-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.07.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Oct 15;202(2):94-100. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.07.116.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, frequent development of leukemia in large animals due to retrovirally transduced HoxB4 gene has been reported. To prevent tumorigenesis, we developed a nonintegrating and nonreplicating Sendai virus vector that did not contain the phosphoprotein gene (SeV/DeltaP), which enabled clearance of the vector and transgene shortly after transduction. We tested the SeV/DeltaP vector expressing the HoxB4 gene (SeV/DeltaP/HoxB4) for the ex vivo expansion of human cord blood CD34(+) cells (HSCs) using a sheep in utero transplantation assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human HSCs were ex vivo-expanded by transduction with SeV/DeltaP/HoxB4 vector and transplanted into the abdominal cavity of fetal sheep. The engraftment of human HSCs in the lambs was quantitatively evaluated by hematopoietic colony-forming unit assays. RESULTS: After transplantation, the HoxB4-transduced HSCs contributed to longer-period (up to 20 months) repopulation in sheep, and human hematopoietic progenitors were detected more frequently in the bone marrow of the HoxB4 group as compared with the control untreated group (p < 0.05). The expansion of human HSCs with the SeV/DeltaP/HoxB4 vector was comparable with previously reported retroviral vectors expressing HoxB4. The SeV/DeltaP/HoxB4 vector and the transgene were cleared from the recipient sheep and leukemia was not detected at 20 months post-transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The SeV/DeltaP vector would be suitable for transient expression of HoxB4 in human CD34(+) cells. In addition, the SeV/DeltaP vector is free of concern about transgene-related and insertional leukemogenesis and should be safer than retroviral vectors.","['Abe, Tomoyuki', 'Masuda, Shigeo', 'Ban, Hiroshi', 'Hayashi, Satoshi', 'Ueda, Yasuji', 'Inoue, Makoto', 'Hasegawa, Mamoru', 'Nagao, Yoshikazu', 'Hanazono, Yutaka']","['Abe T', 'Masuda S', 'Ban H', 'Hayashi S', 'Ueda Y', 'Inoue M', 'Hasegawa M', 'Nagao Y', 'Hanazono Y']","['Division of Biological Production Science, United Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100926,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Sendai virus/*genetics', 'Sheep', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00486-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Jan;39(1):47-54. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.007.

Imatinib, the most successful of molecular targeted therapies, has revolutionized treatment of patients with CML. Despite this achievement, CML is often not curable, largely due to the innate insensitivity of CML stem cells, particularly when in a quiescent state. This failure of not only imatinib but also the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) frequently leads to relapse upon drug discontinuation. Thus, any curative therapy must eliminate CML stem cells. A comprehensive understanding of the biological properties of CML stem cells and an elucidation of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways enabling these CML stem cells to self-renew, combined with insight into the regulation of apoptosis signaling and the mechanisms governing the interaction of CML stem cells with their bone marrow microenvironment, will facilitate the development of therapies for targeting these cells.

Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience a loss of response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation due to toxicity (intolerance). For patients who fail with standard-dose imatinib therapy, imatinib dose escalation is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients experiencing drug toxicity, and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the newer TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutational status. To optimize therapeutic benefit, clinicians should select treatment based on each patient's historical response, adverse-event tolerance level, and risk factors.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(10)00076-4 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2010 Oct;47(4):344-53. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.06.002.,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The discovery that BCR-ABL is reactivated at the time of resistance and the unveiling of point mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL as a major resistance mechanism have driven the development of second-generation TKIs. These agents are effective in a significant proportion of patients who fail to respond to imatinib. Clinical practice guidelines recommend using the BCR-ABL mutation genotype to aid selection of second-line treatment. Although kinase domain mutations are undoubtedly relevant to drug resistance, recent data suggest that additional resistance mechanisms must be operational in patients with and without kinase domain mutations. Clonal chromosomal evolution, BCR-ABL amplification, pharmacogenomic variations, or activation of signaling shortcuts have all been implicated in drug resistance, but their precise contributions to resistance remain to be determined. Additionally, lack of adherence to prescribed medication is likely to set the stage for resistance development. An area of intense research is primary resistance of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are thought to cause minimal residual disease to persist despite sustained treatment.

With the aim of improving the results of the standard imatinib 400 mg/d first-line therapy of CML, several trials have been started and are presently ongoing. The purpose of these trials is to test the efficacy of higher dosages of imatinib and of imatinib in combination with other agents, in particular with interferon alpha (IFN). In addition, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which are now available for treatment of patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, also have been tested for first-line treatment, in the setting of both single-center and multicenter studies. The results of these trials seem to indicate a superior efficacy of the more potent second-generation TKIs with respect to imatinib, particularly in terms of higher rates of complete cytogenetic responses (CCyR) and of major molecular responses (MMR), that, more importantly, also seem to lead to a decreased number of progressions of the disease. Although these results still need to be fully evaluated after a longer period of follow-up, the use of next-generation agents and modified imatinib-based strategies in the first-line therapy of CML is likely to become a key area of clinical research during the next few years.","['Fava, Carmen', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Fava C', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(10)00075-2 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2010 Oct;47(4):319-26. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.06.001.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The only well-documented therapy in the 19th century was use of arsenic in one or other form, which did undoubtedly reduce the leukocyte count but probably did little or nothing to prolong life. These early cases were probably examples of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (then called chronic granulocytic leukemia). In the 20th century important steps in unraveling the pathogenesis of CML were the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome in 1960, and of the (9;22) translocation in 1973. There followed definition of the breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 22 in 1984 and the demonstration of the BCR-ABL transcript in CML in 1985. In the first half of the 20th century patients were treated predominantly with radiotherapy, and later on with busulfan, hydroxycarbamide, or interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha). From 1980 onwards allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) became the treatment of choice for eligible patients. The era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) began in 1998 and today the use of the original TKI, imatinib, has replaced SCT as initial therapy for patients who present with CML in chronic phase.","['Goldman, John M']",['Goldman JM'],"['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK. jgoldman@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/history/therapeutic use', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*history/therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(10)00083-1 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2010 Oct;47(4):302-11. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.07.001.,,,['Copyright (c) 2010.

Although healthy individuals may be affected, the majority of patients diagnosed with zygomycosis have diabetes, malignancy, or have had solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. Unlike other filamentous fungi that tend to disseminate hematogenously to skin, cutaneous zygomycosis most commonly arises via direct inoculation. Cutaneous lesions of zygomycosis are characteristically hemorrhagic, ulcerated or necrotic plaques. Histology typically demonstrates angioinvasion with associated necrosis. CASE: We present a case of a neutropenic patient who presented with disseminated zygomycosis heralded by a clinically non-specific erythematous macule that showed non-specific, mild, inflammatory changes on histological examination. Tissue culture was performed at the time of initial evaluation and was consistent with zygomycosis. Rhizomucor was subsequently confirmed by PCR. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated zygomycosis, treatment was promptly initiated, and the patient recovered completely. Our case represents an atypical clinical and histological presentation of disseminated zygomycosis and highlights the value of performing tissue culture of non-distinctive cutaneous lesions, especially in the setting of severely immunocompromised states.","['Hocker, Thomas Lewis', 'Wada, David Akio', 'Bridges, Alina', 'el-Azhary, Rokea']","['Hocker TL', 'Wada DA', 'Bridges A', 'el-Azhary R']","['Mayo Clinic, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100915,United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,,IM,"['Dermatomycoses/*microbiology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Rhizomucor/*isolation & purification']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/01/13 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2010 Sep 15;16(9):3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to explore their contribution to impaired quality of life (QOL), beyond that of depression and anxiety, in a cancer cohort. METHOD: In a cross-sectional design, an ambulatory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort completed a psychological battery that included the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, the SF-36 Health Survey, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACT), the Looming Cognitive Style Questionnaire (LCSQ), and the Looming Cancer measure. RESULTS: The Looming Cancer measure correlated significantly with overall QOL (FACT-G, p = 0.005). This effect was largely due to the contribution of emotional QOL (Mental Component Score: SF-36, p = 0.001; FACT-emotional, p = 0.001) and functional QOL (FACT-functional, p = 0.001). Looming, unlike anxiety and depression, did not correlate with a worse physical QOL (Physical Component Score: SF-36, FACT-physical). Looming did not impact on social QOL. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that looming predicted 5.4% of the varience on the FACT-emotional, 5.1% on the Mental Component Score (SF-36), and 9.3% on the mental health subscale (SF-36), above and beyond the varience predicted by a constellation of psychosocial factors (including age, marital status, education, income) and the combined effect of depression and anxiety. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: LCS predicts worse emotional and functional QOL, above and beyond the contribution of anxiety, depression, and other psycho-social variables. This suggests that it makes a unique contribution to a worse QOL. Nevertheless, the looming construct still remains primarily a research tool in psycho-oncology at this time.","['Levin, Tomer T', 'Riskind, John', 'Li, Yuelin']","['Levin TT', 'Riskind J', 'Li Y']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA. levint@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,England,Palliat Support Care,Palliative & supportive care,101232529,,IM,"['Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychometrics/statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1478951510000325 [pii]', '10.1017/S1478951510000325 [doi]']",ppublish,Palliat Support Care. 2010 Dec;8(4):449-54. doi: 10.1017/S1478951510000325.

However, occupational and physical therapists work with critically-ill patients to create realistic and meaningful goals for improving comfort, mobility, socialization skills, and ability to care for oneself regardless of disease state and medical status. The following case report describes rehabilitation intervention with a young woman diagnosed with osteosarcoma and leukemia during the final stage of her life. METHOD: This case report highlights the use of patient-centered goals and the importance of close collaboration between the patient, occupational therapist, and physical therapists to achieve a higher quality of life. RESULTS: A collaborative effort by the occupational and physical therapists yielded positive outcomes as defined by the patient, patient family, and the medical staff in the critical care setting. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Palliative care patients may benefit from occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) intervention.

The causes and timing of the mutations are not currently known. We evaluated the prevalence and timing of origin of FLT3 mutations in a population series of childhood leukemia patients from Northern California. METHODS: We screened and sequenced FLT3 mutations (point mutations and internal tandem duplications, ITDs) among 517 childhood leukemia patients, and assessed whether these mutations occurred before or after birth using sensitive ""backtracking"" methods. RESULTS: We determined a mutation prevalence of 9 of 73 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs, 12%) and 9 of 441 acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs, 2%). Among AMLs, FLT3 mutations were more common in older patients, and among ALLs, FLT3 mutations were more common in patients with high hyperdiploidy (3.7%) than those without this cytogenetic feature (1.4%). Five FLT3 ITDs, one deletion mutation, and 3 point mutations were assessed for their presence in neonatal Guthrie spots using sensitive real-time PCR techniques, and no patients were found to harbor FLT3 mutations at birth. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3 mutations were not common in our population-based patient series in California, and patients who harbor FLT3 mutations most likely acquire them after they are born.","['Chang, Patrick', 'Kang, Michelle', 'Xiao, Anny', 'Chang, Jeffrey', 'Feusner, James', 'Buffler, Patricia', 'Wiemels, Joseph']","['Chang P', 'Kang M', 'Xiao A', 'Chang J', 'Feusner J', 'Buffler P', 'Wiemels J']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF, Helen Diller Cancer Research Building, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100927,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-513 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-513 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Sep 27;10:513. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-513.,"['R01 CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES0470/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2955609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently unclear whether these cells are identifiable in T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) of the thymus. The aim of this study was to identify asteroid B cells both in thymic and extrathymic tissue involved by T-ALL/LBL. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thymic, lymph node (LN) and bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMTB) samples from eight patients with T-ALL/LBL were reviewed. All had been investigated by immunohistochemistry and one by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The BMTB samples of two of eight T-ALL/LBLs and LN sample in one of them showed the presence of asteroid-shaped B cells with dendritic cytoplasmic processes. These B cells also expressed CD23 and the features were akin to the unique thymic asteroid B cells. Both patients had aggressive/resistant disease. Cytogenetic analysis in one showed a complex translocation involving the T cell receptor beta (TCRB) gene at 7q35 and a distal region of 9q known to harbour the NOTCH1 gene. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of T-ALL/LBL documenting the presence of an asteroid B cell-rich microenvironment at bone marrow and LN sites. In this small subset, T-ALL/LBL cells are possibly dependent upon asteroid B cells, and whether targeting of asteroid B cells with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in such cases will result in clinical benefit remains to be determined.","['Naresh, Kikkeri N', 'May, Philippa C', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Marks, Alexandra J', 'Macdonald, Donald', 'Kanfer, Ed']","['Naresh KN', 'May PC', 'Reid AG', 'Marks AJ', 'Macdonald D', 'Kanfer E']","['Departments of Histopathology and Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK. k.naresh@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100928,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/*pathology']",2010/09/30 06:00,2011/02/05 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03663.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2010 Oct;57(4):549-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03663.x.

Although VL has been quantified by in-house real-time quantifiable polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology, little is known about the harmonization among different VL assay systems. We evaluated intra- and inter-laboratory variability of VL measured at six laboratories using the same DNA samples seropositive for HTLV-1 in a two-step manner. The first study measured 60 samples by original in-house assays, finding that the median intra- and inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) was 44.9% (range, 25.4-71.8%) and 59.9% (34.2-93.4%), respectively. The inter-laboratory correlation coefficients ranged from 0.760 to 0.875, indicating that VL were measured with good precision in each laboratory, but inter-laboratory regression slopes differed from 0.399 to 2.206, indicating that VL were measured with a wide variation between laboratories. To examine the effect of standardization of reference materials (RM) on the VL variability, we performed a second study using only 20 samples by substituting RM for plasmid including the HTLV-1 pX region. The median inter-laboratory CV for raw pX copy number was reduced significantly from 66.9% to 35.7%, whereas the median CV for the internal control remained almost unchanged, resulting in no improvement in inter-laboratory CV for VL. This indicates that each in-house assay system worked well with good precision, but standardizing RM alone was insufficient for harmonization. The relevant choice of not only RM, but also internal control genes for data normalization is expected to be realistic to standardize HTLV-1 VL measurement.","['Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Satake, Masahiro', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Umeki, Kazumi', 'Kubota, Ryuji', 'Izumo, Shuji', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Kamihira S', 'Yamano Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Sasaki D', 'Satake M', 'Okayama A', 'Umeki K', 'Kubota R', 'Izumo S', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. kamihira@nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100928,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*standards', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Viral Load']",2010/09/30 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01720.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Nov;101(11):2361-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01720.x.

Lysis of NK sensitive target cells could be mediated independently of antigen stimulation and without requirement of peptide presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. NK cell activity and functions are controlled by a considerable number of cell surface receptors, which exist in both inhibitory and activating isoforms. There are several groups of NK cell surface receptors: 1) killer immunoglobulin like receptors-KIR, 2) C-type lectin receptors, 3) natural citotoxicity receptors-NCR and 4) Toll-like receptors-TLR. FUNCTIONS OF NK RECEPTORS: Defining the biology of NK cell surface receptors has contributed to the concept of the manner how NK cells selectively recognize and lyse tumor and virally infected cells while sparing normal cells. Further, identification of NK receptor ligands and their expression on the normal and transformed cells has led to the development of clinical approaches to manipulating receptor/ligand interactions that showed clinical benefit. NK cells are the first lymphocyte subset that reconstitute the peripheral blood following allogeneic HSCT and multiple roles for alloreactive donor NK cells have been demonstrated, in diminishing Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) through selective killing recipient dendritic cells, prevention of graft rejection by killing recipient T cells and participation in Graft vs. Leukaemia (GvL) effect through destruction of residual host tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Besides their role in HSCT, NK cell receptors have an important clinical relevance that reflects from the fact that they play a crucial role in the development of some diseases as well as in possibilities of managing all NK receptors through selective expansion and usage of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy.","['Vojvodic, Svetlana', 'Popovic, Stevan']","['Vojvodic S', 'Popovic S']","['Zavod za transfuziju krvi Vojvodine, Novi Sad. ssvu@Eunet.rs']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*physiology']",2010/09/29 06:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2010/09/29 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/mpns1002091v [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2010 Jan-Feb;63(1-2):91-7. doi: 10.2298/mpns1002091v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In patients with AL in remission receiving ATG in conditioning modes (Atgam 60 mg/kg or thymoglobulin 7.5 mg/kg), overall three-year survival was 60%.

To assess the prognostic impact of the two gene mutations in Chinese AML patients, we used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis to screen 76 AML patients with normal cytogenetics for mutations in FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) and exon 12 of the NPM1 gene. FLT3/ITD mutation was detected in 15 (19.7%) of 76 subjects, and NPM1 mutation in 20 (26.3%) subjects. Seven (9.2%) cases were positive for both FLT3/ITD and NPM1 mutations. Significantly more FLT3/ITD aberration was detected in subjects with French-American-British (FAB) M1 (42.8%). NPM1 mutation was frequently detected in subjects with M5 (47.1%) and infrequently in subjects with M2 (11.1%). FLT3 and NPM1 mutations were significantly associated with a higher white blood cell count in peripheral blood and a lower CD34 antigen expression, but not age, sex, or platelet count. Statistical analysis revealed that the FLT3/ITD-positive group had a lower complete remission (CR) rate (53.3% vs. 83.6%). Survival analysis showed that the FLT3/ITD-positive/NPM1 mutation-negative group had worse overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). The FLT3/ITD-positive/NPM1 mutation-positive group showed a trend towards favorable survival compared with the FLT3/ITD-positive/NPM1 mutation-negative group (P=0.069).

ABC values and the effect of technical variables on CD22 quantitation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FCL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and normal B cells were studied. METHODS: The QuantiBrite System(R) was used to determine the level of CD22 expression (mean antibody bound per cell, ABC) by malignant and normal B cells. The intra-assay variability, number of cells required for precision, effect of delayed processing as well as shipment of peripheral blood specimens (delayed processing and exposure to noncontrolled environments), and the effect of paraformaldehyde fixation on assay results were studied. RESULTS: The QuantiBRITE method of measuring CD22 ABC is precise (median CV 1.6%, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.3%) but a threshold of 250 malignant cells is required for reliable CD22 ABC values. Delayed processing and overnight shipment of specimens resulted in significantly different ABC values whereas fixation for up to 12 h had no significant effect. ABC measurements determined that CD22 expression is lower than normal in ALL, CLL, FCL, and MCL but higher than normal in HCL. CONCLUSIONS: CD22 expression was atypical in the hematolymphoid malignancies studied and may have diagnostic utility.

Unfortunately, the cell preparation of all commercial kits available includes cell washing known to cause cell loss which is most likely to affect apoptotic cells in particular. To address this, we developed a seven-color single-platform no-wash analysis technique and compared the results with those from an analogous procedure including cell washing. A five-color mAb cocktail was employed to address target cells by surface labeling, Yo-PRO-1(R) and DAPI were used to discriminate apoptotic and necrotic from viable cells. Cells were quantified on the basis of internal-standard fluorescent beads. Jurkat cells ACC 282 treated with camptothecin were employed to establish the staining procedure, which was then applied to blood cells collected by extracorporeal apheresis and treated with UV irradiation. Data evaluation showed that although each method by itself was highly reproducible (R(2) = 0.973), the numbers of apoptotic cells detected with the no-wash procedure were significantly higher than those obtained after cell washing (P = 6.6 E(-5), Wilcoxon Test). In addition, the observed differences increased with higher cell numbers (Bland and Altmann). We conclude that the described test is a feasible and reliable tool for apoptosis measurement and it provides results that are definitely closer to the truth than those obtained from kits that require cell washing.","['Stemberger, Julia', 'Witt, Volker', 'Printz, Dieter', 'Geyeregger, Rene', 'Fritsch, Gerhard']","['Stemberger J', 'Witt V', 'Printz D', 'Geyeregger R', 'Fritsch G']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Currently, only allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers a curative option in this setting and no preferred regimen has been established. The reported efficacy of second-line regimens is widely disparate, thus limiting informed clinical decision making. A retrospective review of 77 patients receiving therapy between 2001 and 2008 with relapsed, 42, and refractory, 35, AML was performed to determine overall response rate and survival following mitoxantrone (8 mg/m(2)/day), etoposide (100 mg/m(2)/day), and cytarabine (1,000 mg/m(2)/day) chemotherapy administered over 5 days. Among 77 patients (median age of 54 years and 64% intermediate risk karyotype) with median follow-up of 153 days, 18% achieved a complete response and 8% a morphologic leukemia-free state. Fifty-seven (74%) experienced treatment failure, 10 of whom achieved a remission after additional therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 6.8 months. Among patients achieving a response, 50% received consolidation with allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT (5%), or consolidation chemotherapy alone (45%). A nonsignificant trend in overall response (50%, 27%, and 23.8%) and median OS (8.3, 6.8, and 4.7 months) was observed by cytogenetic stratification into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk.

We searched for previous IGH gene rearranged B lymphocyte clones in healthy people who developed CLL and estimated the time for the clone to become clinically detectable. To this aim, we identified all incident cases of CLL diagnosed in a cohort of 15,055 healthy subjects aged 18-65 years enrolled in a prospective survey on thrombophilia. Seven CLL cases were identified at a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 18-89). The estimated incidence was 0.46 cases/10,000 person-years (CI: 0.17-1.00). A PCR was performed to detect IGH gene rearrangement at enrollment and at CLL diagnosis. Comparison was possible in six subjects. In five, the same IGH gene rearrangement and gene sequence were already present 39-89 months before CLL diagnosis. A mutated status was identified in four of five cases. The median age at diagnosis was 66.2 years, and all subjects were asymptomatic. Two patients expressing the IGHV1-69 gene with an unmutated status required treatment 16 and 40 months after diagnosis. The IGHV4 family genes were rearranged in the remaining cases, all showing a mutated status. No additional rearrangements or mutations in the rearranged gene were found during follow-up.

In this study, the long-term outcomes of HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) with mismatched related donor (MRD) and unrelated donor (URD) transplantation for CML in the first chronic phase (CML-CP1) using different graft vs. host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens according to donor source and the degree of HLA matching were compared. The data of 91 patients with CML-CP1 were analyzed with respect to GVHD, overall survival (OS), and transplant-related mortality (TRM). The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 25.5% in the MSD and 40.5% in the MRD/URD group (P = 0.133). The 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was not different between the MSD and the MRD/URD groups, while extensive chronic GVHD was different between the two groups (31.9% vs. 10.8%, P = 0.023). The 5-year cumulative relapse rate was not different between the MSD and the MRD/URD groups, while TRM was different between the two groups (6.6% vs. 26.3%, P = 0.010).

In the present paper, we describe and review the cytogenetic findings in peripheral lymphocytes from ALL survivors, and discuss aspects associated to the occurrence of increased chromosome rearrangements in this growing cohort.","['Brassesco, Maria Sol', 'Xavier, Danilo Jordao', 'Camparoto, Marjori Leiva', 'Montaldi, Ana Paula', ""de Godoy, Paulo Roberto D'Auria Vieira"", 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga', 'Sakamoto-Hojo, Elza Tiemi']","['Brassesco MS', 'Xavier DJ', 'Camparoto ML', 'Montaldi AP', 'de Godoy PR', 'Scrideli CA', 'Tone LG', 'Sakamoto-Hojo ET']","['Departamento de Puericultura e Pediatria, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, 14040-901 Sao Paulo, Brazil. solbrassesco@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100831,United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/230481 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2011;2011. doi: 10.1155/2011/230481.

METHODS: Survival data for patients with invasive cancer was obtained from the Hoag Hospital tumor registry for the successive periods 1986-1991 and for 1992-1999 for historical intramural comparisons; national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data for the same periods were used for contemporary and historical extramural comparisons. RESULTS: We observed survival improved significantly during 1992-1999 compared with 1986-1991 for all patients with invasive cancers (P < .0001), and specifically for cancers of the breast (P = .026), lung (P = .012), prostate (P < .0001), stomach (P = .006), pancreas (P = .0001), and oral cavity (P = .024), with strong trends for improved survival for leukemia (P = .051) and rectal cancer (P = .063). Relative 5-year survival rates increased from 63% during 1986-1991 to 71% during 1992-1999, and were higher for 22 of 24 tumor types during the more recent period (P < .0001). Compared with SEER data, Hoag relative survival for all patients with invasive cancer was 63% versus 58% during 1986-1991, and 71% versus 64% during 1992-1999. Survival for Hoag patients was better than SEER rates for only 50% of malignancies (12 of 24) during 1986-1991 compared with 87% (21 of 24) during 1992-1999 (P = .013). In the most common tumor types, there were substantial improvements in survival for patients with regional disease at diagnosis. Improved survival was associated with earlier diagnosis and increased use of systemic treatment and combined modality therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with invasive cancer who were treated at an integrated community cancer center had better survival compared with historical survival and patients from the SEER registry. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the accelerated dissemination of new information resulted in earlier adoption of improved screening, diagnostic, and multidisciplinary treatment approaches, leading to higher survival rates.","['Dillman, Robert O', 'Chico, Sherri D']","['Dillman RO', 'Chico SD']","['Hoag Cancer Center, Newport Beach, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,,,2005/09/01 00:00,2005/09/01 00:01,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2005/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2005/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1200/JOP.2005.1.3.84 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2005 Sep;1(3):84-92. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2005.1.3.84.,,PMC2794389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ectopic expression of MICA on tumor cells elicits anti-tumor responses, soluble MICA downregulates the activities of lymphocytes. In this study, we showed that recombinant, immobilized MICA (iMICA) molecules coated on plastic wells weakly promote peripheral NK cell activation, secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma and degranulation without inducing apoptosis. In addition, iMICA synergized with IL-15 and soluble 4-1BB ligand (s4-1BBL) to expand NK cells 25- to 42-fold in a 13-day culture, whereas NK cells stimulated only with IL-15 and s4-1BBL expanded 10- to 16-fold. In contrast to NK cells expanded by IL-15 and s4-1BBL stimulation, NK cells expanded long term in the presence of iMICA exhibited increased cytotoxicity against leukemia cells. These results suggest that large numbers of NK cells with high cytotoxicity can be generated by stimulation with IL-15 and s4-1BBL in the presence of iMICA and that these cells can be used for adoptive cancer immunotherapy.","['Gong, Weijuan', 'Xiao, Weiming', 'Qian, Li', 'Gong, Chunxiang', 'Hu, Maozhi', 'Pan, Xianyuan', 'Ji, Mingchun']","['Gong W', 'Xiao W', 'Qian L', 'Gong C', 'Hu M', 'Pan X', 'Ji M']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, PR China. wjgong@yzu.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100927,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Immobilized Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immobilized Proteins/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/metabolism', 'Solubility/drug effects']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/03/03 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['cmi201041 [pii]', '10.1038/cmi.2010.41 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2010 Nov;7(6):477-84. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2010.41.

Treatment of relapsed disease gives much lower response rates of short duration. We undertook this study of the protein deacetylase inhibitor Romidepsin in chemosensitive recurrent SCLC based on preclinical data that suggested this to be an active target. METHODS: Patients had recurrent chemosensitive SCLC (relapse >/=90 days since completion of platinum-based chemotherapy). Treatment was administered as weekly infusions of Romidepsin at 13 mg/m(2) for 3 of 4 weeks. We designed a two-stage phase II study targeting a response rate of 30% (<10% response would be uninteresting and >/=30% worthy of further study). RESULTS: Sixteen patients (10 male, 6 female) were accrued to the first stage of this study. Most (11 patients, 69%) presented with extensive-stage SCLC, and all had received prior chemotherapy, with 11 having received prior radiation. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was excellent with 0 in 6 patients (38%) and 1 in 10 patients. No objective responses were seen, and stable disease was the best response seen in 3 patients (19%). Toxicity was modest with 3 patients suffering grade 3 toxicity (lymphopenia, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, and hyponatremia) and one patient with grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months, and median overall survival was 6 months. CONCLUSION: Romidepsin given on a weekly schedule in patients with chemosensitive, recurrent SCLC was inactive and will not be pursued further in this setting.","['Otterson, Gregory A', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Pang, Herbert', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Otterson GA', 'Hodgson L', 'Pang H', 'Vokes EE']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. greg.otterson@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Depsipeptides/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181ec1713 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31813-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2010 Oct;5(10):1644-8. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181ec1713.,"['U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA059518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA114558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3782083,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,['NIHMS229798'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most cases, transient myeloproliferative disorders require no treatment, while acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia of Down's syndrome is characterised by an increased sensitivity to chemotherapy and its treatment should be adapted with a reduction in dose intensity. Both entities share specific mutations at exon 2 of the transcription factor GATA1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed biological features and GATA1 mutations in 4 patients with transient abnormal myelopoiesis (2) and acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (2) including one phenotypically normal trisomy 21 mosaicism. We found abnormal GATA1 mutated clones in each case, and a specific point mutation at exon 2 was detected in three cases. Given the heterogeneous phenotype of megakaryoblastic blasts and the low percentage of blasts at presentation, the recognition of GATA1 mutations was helpful for diagnosis. In addition, molecular remission was established in 2 patients after subsequent normal mutational GATA1 analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that GATA1 mutational study is a useful tool for the diagnosis and management of trisomy 21 associated myeloproliferative disorders.","['Fuster Soler, J L', 'Norton, A', 'Galera Minarro, A', 'Bermudez Cortes, M', 'Llinares Riestra, M E', 'Ortuno Giner, F']","['Fuster Soler JL', 'Norton A', 'Galera Minarro A', 'Bermudez Cortes M', 'Llinares Riestra ME', 'Ortuno Giner F']","['Unidad de Oncohematologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, El Palmar, Murcia, Spain. igonzalezv@salud.aragon.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20100925,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/*genetics']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/05/04 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2009/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(10)00374-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2010.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2011 Jan;74(1):31-7. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2010.08.012.

Recent evidence demonstrates a crucial role of LIF in neuroprotection and axonal regeneration as well as the prevention of demyelination.

A retrospective analysis.,875-84,10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.016 [doi],"For patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are unable to secure an acceptable HLA donor, the role of autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) has remained controversial. Its effectiveness remains unclear as, when analyzed on intention-to-treat strategies, a significant number do not undergo the procedure, whereas others seem to fail therapy from pretransplant recurrences. To improve our counseling to our patients on these 2 therapeutic options, we compared the outcome of patients in first remission of AML who actually underwent autologous or allogeneic transplantation. The choice for the type of graft was based on availability of HLA identical siblings. Patients received myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic or autologous cytokine mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. For prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), grafts were incubated ex vivo with anti-CD52 antibodies and patients were prescribed cyclosporin until day 90. Patients were stratified by clinical and laboratory factors as well as cytogenetic risk. The endpoints were treatment-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). The median presentation age for both transplant groups was 35 (14-60) years. Of the 112 consecutive patients achieving remission, autologous or allogeneic grafts were transplanted to 43 and 32 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in the presentation clinical features, laboratory parameters, marrow morphology, or proportion of low and intermediate cytogenetic risk for both transplant options. Treatment mortality as well as relapse rate was similar (14% and 15%; 39% and 27%, respectively). At a median of 1609 and 1819 posttransplant days, 56% and 63% in each group survived. In univariate analysis performance status, cytogenetic risk, morphologic features of dysplasia, blast count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significant factors for survival. Although for the entire group there was no difference in survival between both modalities, all patients with unfavorable cytogenetics receiving an autologous graft died of disease recurrence (3-year survival 35% versus 0%; P = .05). We conclude that patients with AML who have low or intermediate cytogenetic risk undergoing myeloablative conditioning followed by autologous or allogeneic T cell-depleted stem cell transplantation appeared to have similar outcome. However, those with unfavorable karyotype are unlikely to be cured with autologous grafts and are candidates for experimental modalities.","['Novitzky, Nicolas', 'Thomas, Valda', 'du Toit, Cecile', 'McDonald, Andrew']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomas V', 'du Toit C', 'McDonald A']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, Cape Town, South Africa. nicolas.novitzky@uct.ac.za']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100924,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', 'South Africa', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00396-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jun;17(6):875-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.016.

There are no data on ES after syngeneic HSCT. We retrospectively analyzed syngeneic HSCT outcomes and determined ES incidence, risk factors, and prognostic impact. Thirty-two adult patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 22-60) underwent syngeneic HSCT at our institution between July 1986 and April 2009, primarily for hematologic malignancies (65% lymphoid-including 15% plasma cell; 31% myeloid). The median duration of follow-up was 6.1 years (range: 3.7 months to 18.1 years). Five-year progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS) was 52% and 67%, respectively. Five-year overall cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 37.6% and 10.2%, respectively; with increased relapse incidence of 76.3% in myeloid disease (P = .002). Fifteen patients (47%) met diagnostic criteria for ES, 10 (67%) of whom received systemic steroids. Five-year PFS was 47% in patients with ES versus 56% in those without (P = .37). Five-year OS was 63% with ES versus 71% without (P = .80). Five-year cumulative incidence of NRM was 21% with ES versus 0% without (P = .06). Five-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 32% with ES and 44% without (P = .68). Older age (P = .05) and possibly total body irradiation-based conditioning (P = .09) were risk factors for developing ES. In multivariable Cox models only diagnosis (myeloid disease) impaired OS and PFS. In summary, we document a high incidence of ES after syngeneic HSCT. The trend of increased NRM after ES requires reevaluation in a larger syngeneic HSCT cohort.","['Koreth, John', 'Biernacki, Melinda', 'Aldridge, Julie', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd', 'Armand, Philippe', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J']","['Koreth J', 'Biernacki M', 'Aldridge J', 'Kim HT', 'Alyea EP 3rd', 'Armand P', 'Cutler C', 'Ho VT', 'Wu CJ', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. john_koreth@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100924,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Cohort Studies', 'Erythema/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Pulmonary Edema/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/06/04 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00393-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Mar;17(3):421-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.013.

This reaction, catalyzed by myeloperoxidase, requires chloride anion (Cl(-)) as a substrate. Thus, Cl(-) availability is a rate-limiting factor that affects neutrophil microbicidal function. Our previous research demonstrated that defective CFTR, a cAMP-activated chloride channel, present in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients leads to deficient chloride transport to neutrophil phagosomes and impaired bacterial killing. To confirm this finding, here we used RNA interference against this chloride channel to abate CFTR expression in the neutrophil-like cells derived from HL60 cells, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, with dimethyl sulfoxide. The resultant CFTR deficiency in the phagocytes compromised their bactericidal capability, thereby recapitulating the phenotype seen in CF patient cells. The results provide further evidence suggesting that CFTR plays an important role in phagocytic host defense.","['Bonvillain, Ryan W', 'Painter, Richard G', 'Adams, Daniel E', 'Viswanathan, Anand', 'Lanson, Nicholas A Jr', 'Wang, Guoshun']","['Bonvillain RW', 'Painter RG', 'Adams DE', 'Viswanathan A', 'Lanson NA Jr', 'Wang G']","['Department of Genetics, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100924,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (CFTR protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/*genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hypochlorous Acid/metabolism', 'Microbial Viability', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Phagocytes/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*physiology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(10)00557-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2010 Dec 15;49(12):1872-80. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.09.012.

In the human leukemia cell lines - RS4;11 and SEMK2-M1, both of which express MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL, we knocked down the expression of AF4-MLL using siRNA. Loss of AF4-MLL had no effect on the growth of either RS4;11 or SEMK2-M1 cells. Furthermore, in SEMK2-M1 cells there were no changes in cell cycle or apoptosis with loss of AF4-MLL. In contrast, knockdown of MLL-AF4 significantly inhibited growth of both RS4;11 and SEMK2-M1. Additionally, in SEMK2-M1 cells, loss of MLL-AF4 led to G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis.

These Epstein-Barr virus-B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are thought to be related to immune suppression induced by fludarabine/other chemotherapeutic regimens. As in other immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, these disorders demonstrate a heterogeneous histological spectrum that ranges from polymorphic to monomorphic to classical Hodgkin lymphoma-like lesions. We report a case of concurrent classical Hodgkin lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with fludarabine. Both classical Hodgkin lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma were positive for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA, whereas classical Hodgkin lymphoma was also positive for Epstein-Barr virus- latent membrane protein 1, suggesting a different viral latency.

Acquired immune tolerance to leukemic antigens further enables tumor cell expansion. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy interferes with the immunoregulatory system by targeting off-target kinases both in malignant and nonmalignant cells. The aim of this study was to analyze the immune cell function by phosphoprotein profiling in CML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from diagnostic phase and TKI-treated patients were analyzed by multicolor phosphoprotein flow cytometry enabling measurements at the single-cell level. Both unstimulated baseline activation status and cytokine-induced responses were evaluated. RESULTS: In diagnostic-phase and imatinib-treated patients, the baseline phosphoprotein activation status was similar to healthy controls. In dasatinib-treated patients, basal phosphoprotein levels were slightly decreased; in particular, the signal transduction and activator of transcription protein 3 pathway was affected in both myeloid and lymphoid cells. The activation responses to various cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in particular were significantly suppressed in untreated CML patients. During imatinib and dasatinib therapy, the aberrantly suppressed phosphorylation responses were normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine responses are hampered in untreated CML patients, which may have an effect on various immunological processes in vivo. Interestingly, during TKI treatment, phosphorylation responses were normal, suggesting that TKI treatment does not alter the reactivity of healthy immune effector cells. However, dasatinib treatment was associated with diminished basal activation of the immunosuppressive signal transduction and activator of transcription protein 3 signaling pathway, which could have clinical significance in reversing the lymphocyte anergy against tumor cells.","['Jalkanen, Sari E', 'Vakkila, Jukka', 'Kreutzman, Anna', 'Nieminen, Janne K', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Jalkanen SE', 'Vakkila J', 'Kreutzman A', 'Nieminen JK', 'Porkka K', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101012,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00414-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Jan;39(1):102-113.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.005.

As a result, patients are unlikely to be cured owing to the persistence of leukemic quiescent stem cells (QSC) capable of initiating relapse. Previously, we have reported that intracellular levels of imatinib in primary primitive CML cells (CD34+38(lo/(-))), are significantly lower than in CML progenitor cells (total CD34+) and leukemic cell lines. The aim of this study was to determine if potentially sub-therapeutic intracellular drug concentrations in persistent leukemic QSC may be overcome by targeted drug delivery using synthetic Low Density Lipoprotein (sLDL) particles. As a first step towards this goal, however, the extent of uptake of sLDL by leukemic cell lines and CML patient stem/progenitor cells was investigated. Results with non-drug loaded particles have shown an increased and preferential uptake of sLDL by Bcr-Abl positive cell lines in comparison to Bcr-Abl negative. Furthermore, CML CD34+ and primitive CD34+38(lo/(-)) cells accumulated significantly higher levels of sLDL when compared with non-CML CD34+ cells. Thus, drug-loading the sLDL nanoparticles could potentially enhance intracellular drug concentrations in primitive CML cells and thus aid their eradication.","['Zhou, Peixun', 'Hatziieremia, Sophia', 'Elliott, Moira A', 'Scobie, Linda', 'Crossan, Claire', 'Michie, Alison M', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Halbert, Gavin W', 'Jorgensen, Heather G']","['Zhou P', 'Hatziieremia S', 'Elliott MA', 'Scobie L', 'Crossan C', 'Michie AM', 'Holyoake TL', 'Halbert GW', 'Jorgensen HG']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, 1053 Great Western Road, Glasgow G120NY, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/03/26 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(10)00781-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2010 Dec 20;148(3):380-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.09.016.

Although sequencing efforts have uncovered transforming JAK1 mutations in acute leukaemia, they have also identified non-transforming JAK1 mutations. Thus with limited knowledge of the mechanisms of JAK1 activation by mutation, sequencing may not readily identify transforming mutations. Therefore we sought to further understand the repertoire of transforming mutations of JAK1. We identified seven randomly generated transforming JAK1 mutations, including V658L and a deletion of amino acids 629-630 in the pseudokinase domain, as well as L910P, F938S, P960S, K1026E and Y1035C within the kinase domain. These mutations led to differential signalling activation, but exhibited similar transforming abilities, in BaF3 cells. Interestingly, these properties did not always correlate with JAK1 activation-loop phosphorylation. We also identified a JAK1 mutant that did not require a functional FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain for transformation. Although we isolated a mutation of JAK1 at residue Val658, which is found mutated in acute leukaemia patients, most of the mutations we identified are within the kinase domain and have yet to be identified in patients. Interestingly, compared with cells expressing JAK1-V658F, cells expressing these mutants had higher STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) phosphorylation and were more sensitive to interferon-gamma-mediated growth inhibition. The differential STAT1 activation and interferon-sensitivity of JAK1 mutants may contribute to the determination of which specific JAK1 mutations ultimately contribute to disease and thus are identified in patients. Our characterization of these novel mutations contributes to a better understanding of mutational activation of JAK1.","['Gordon, Geoff M', 'Lambert, Que T', 'Daniel, Kenyon G', 'Reuther, Gary W']","['Gordon GM', 'Lambert QT', 'Daniel KG', 'Reuther GW']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (EPB41L4B protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/09/28 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20100774 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20100774 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2010 Dec 1;432(2):255-65. doi: 10.1042/BJ20100774.,['K01 CA098330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4739517,,,,,,['NIHMS755238'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In epidemiology studies of men in the styrene-butadiene rubber industry, leukemia mortality is associated with butadiene exposure, and this association is most pronounced for high-intensity BD exposures. Metabolism is an important determinant of BD carcinogenicity. BD is metabolized to several electrophilic intermediates, including epoxybutene (EB), diepoxybutane (DEB), and epoxybutane diol (EBD), which differ considerably in their genotoxic potency (DEB &gt;> EB > EBD). Important species differences exist with respect to the formation of reactive metabolites and their subsequent detoxification, which underlie observed species differences in sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of BD. The modes of action for human leukemia and for the observed solid tumors in rodents are both likely related to the genotoxic potencies for one or more of these metabolites. A number of factors related to metabolism can also contribute to nonlinearity in the dose-response relationship, including enzyme induction and inhibition, depletion of tissue glutathione, and saturation of oxidative metabolism.

These can be stimulating, leading to improved clearance of infections, or inhibiting, increasing susceptibility toward infectious agents. One in vivo observation in cadmium-exposed individuals is increased monocyte numbers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the impact of cadmium on monocyte differentiation in the HL-60 model cell line. Administered alone, cadmium had no effect. However, cadmium amplified the expression of monocyte surface markers CD11b and CD14 when differentiation was induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). Furthermore, differentiation with VD3 in the presence of cadmium augmented key monocyte functions: the capacities to perform phagocytosis and generate an oxidative burst. One important signaling pathway required for monocyte differentiation involves extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Notably, cadmium induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, U0126, which inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation by upstream MAPK/ERK kinases (MEK)1/2, reduced VD3-mediated differentiation and abrogated the effects of cadmium. In conclusion, cadmium can augment monocytic differentiation by activating ERK1/2 signaling, leading to increased generation of functional monocytes. These increased monocyte numbers could contribute to the impact of cadmium on the immune system owing to their role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of T-cells by antigen presentation.","['Ober-Blobaum, Julia L', 'Engelhardt, Gabriela', 'Hebel, Silke', 'Rink, Lothar', 'Haase, Hajo']","['Ober-Blobaum JL', 'Engelhardt G', 'Hebel S', 'Rink L', 'Haase H']","['Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Ions)', '0 (dihydroxy-vitamin D3)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['*Cadmium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ions', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', '*Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/BC.2010.135 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2010 Nov;391(11):1295-303. doi: 10.1515/BC.2010.135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we applied this C2-streptavidin delivery system to macrophages and other leukocytes. First, the effect of wild-type C2 toxin on different leukocyte cell lines was tested, indicating no differences in sensitivity. Next, the uptake and stability of the engineered C2-streptavidin was analyzed in macrophages and Jurkat T-cells, showing internalization into the cytosol of both cell types with similar kinetics. The transporter did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect and did not interfere with phagocytosis in primary human macrophages. The C2-streptavidin system promoted specific uptake of biotinylated fluorophores into the cytosol of macrophages as revealed by confocal microscopy. In addition, flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly enhanced uptake of biotinylated fluorescent tracers in Jurkat leukemia cells mediated by the C2-streptavidin transporter.

We used SILAC to measure how cellular treatment with the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib affects protein binding to a generic kinase inhibitor resin and further quantified site-specific phosphorylations on resin-retained proteins. Our integrated approach indicated additional imatinib target candidates, such as flavine adenine dinucleotide synthetase, as well as repressed phosphorylation events on downstream effectors not yet implicated in imatinib-regulated signaling. These included activity-regulating phosphorylations on the kinases Btk, Fer, and focal adhesion kinase, which may qualify them as alternative target candidates in Bcr-Abl-driven oncogenesis. Our approach is rather generic and may have various applications in kinase drug discovery.","['Breitkopf, Susanne B', 'Oppermann, Felix S', 'Keri, Gyorgy', 'Grammel, Markus', 'Daub, Henrik']","['Breitkopf SB', 'Oppermann FS', 'Keri G', 'Grammel M', 'Daub H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101019,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.2 (FMN adenylyltransferase)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Nucleotidyltransferases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/09/28 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr1008527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2010 Nov 5;9(11):6033-43. doi: 10.1021/pr1008527.

It was recently reported to affect the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In our studies on KIR2DS5 gene associations with human diseases, we compared the frequencies of this gene in patients and relevant controls. Typing for KIR2DS5 gene was performed by either individual or multiplex polymerase chain reactions which, when compared in the same samples, gave concordant results. We noted an apparently protective effect of KIR2DS5 gene presence in several clinical conditions, but not in others. Namely, this effect was observed in ankylosing spondylitis (p=0.003, odds ratio [OR]=0.47, confidence interval [CI]=0.28-0.79), endometriosis (p=0.03, OR=0.25, CI = 0.07-0.82) and acute rejection of kidney graft (p=0.0056, OR=0.44, CI=0.24-0.80), but not in non-small-cell lung carcinoma, rheumatoid arthritis, spontaneous abortion, or leukemia (all p>0.05). In addition, the simultaneous presence of KIR2DS5 gene and HLA-C C1 allotype exhibited an even stronger protective effect on ankylosing spondylitis (p=0.0003, OR=0.35, CI=0.19-0.65), whereas a lack of KIR2DS5 and the presence of the HLA-C C2 allotype was associated with ankylosing spondylitis (p=0.0017, OR=1.92, CI=1.28-2.89), whereas a lack of KIR2DS5 and presence of C1 allotype was associated with rheumatoid arthritis (p=0.005, OR=1.47, CI=1.13-1.92). The presence of both KIR2DS5 and C1 seemed to protect from acute kidney graft rejection (p=0.017, OR=0.47, CI=0.25-0.89), whereas lack of KIR2DS5 and presence of C2 seemed to favor rejection (p=0.0015, OR=2.13, CI=1.34-3.37). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that KIR2DS5 may protect from endometriosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and acute rejection of kidney graft.","['Nowak, Izabela', 'Majorczyk, Edyta', 'Wisniewski, Andrzej', 'Pawlik, Andrzej', 'Magott-Procelewska, Maria', 'Passowicz-Muszynska, Ewa', 'Malejczyk, Jacek', 'Ploski, Rafal', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Barcz, Ewa', 'Zon-Giebel, Aleksandra', 'Malinowski, Andrzej', 'Tchorzewski, Henryk', 'Chlebicki, Arkadiusz', 'Luszczek, Wioleta', 'Kurpisz, Maciej', 'Grybos, Marian', 'Wilczynski, Jacek', 'Wiland, Piotr', 'Senitzer, David', 'Sun, Ji-Yao', 'Jankowska, Renata', 'Klinger, Marian', 'Kusnierczyk, Piotr']","['Nowak I', 'Majorczyk E', 'Wisniewski A', 'Pawlik A', 'Magott-Procelewska M', 'Passowicz-Muszynska E', 'Malejczyk J', 'Ploski R', 'Giebel S', 'Barcz E', 'Zon-Giebel A', 'Malinowski A', 'Tchorzewski H', 'Chlebicki A', 'Luszczek W', 'Kurpisz M', 'Grybos M', 'Wilczynski J', 'Wiland P', 'Senitzer D', 'Sun JY', 'Jankowska R', 'Klinger M', 'Kusnierczyk P']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100826,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (KIR2DS5 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease/*genetics', 'Endometriosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Graft Rejection/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/25 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012381 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Aug 26;5(8):e12381. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012381.,,PMC2928722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate their role in regulating epithelial cell expression of fucosylated structures required for embryo attachment and implantation, fucosyltransferase enzymes Fut1, Fut2 (Enzyme Commission number [EC] 2.4.1.69), and Fut4 (EC 2.4.1.214) and Muc1 and Muc4 mRNAs were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR in uterine epithelial cells after laser capture microdissection in situ or after epithelial cell coculture with macrophages or macrophage-secreted factors. When uterine macrophage recruitment was impaired by mating with seminal plasma-deficient males, epithelial cell Fut2 expression on Day 3.5 postcoitus (pc) was reduced compared to intact-mated controls. Epithelial cell Fut2 was upregulated in vitro by coculture with macrophages or macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM). Macrophage-derived cytokines LIF, IL1B, and IL12 replicated the effect of MCM on Fut2 mRNA expression, and MCM-stimulated expression was inhibited by anti-LIF and anti-IL1B neutralizing antibodies. The effects of acute macrophage depletion on fucosylated structures detected with lectins Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA-1) and Lotus tetragonolobus purpureas (LTP), or LewisX immunoreactivity, were quantified in vivo in Cd11b-dtr transgenic mice. Depletion of macrophages caused a 30% reduction in luminal epithelial UEA-1 staining and a 67% reduction in LewisX staining in uterine tissues of mice hormonally treated to mimic early pregnancy. Together, these data demonstrate that uterine epithelial Fut2 mRNA expression and terminal fucosylation of embryo attachment ligands is regulated in preparation for implantation by factors including LIF and IL1B secreted from macrophages recruited during the inflammatory response to insemination.","['Jasper, Melinda J', 'Care, Alison S', 'Sullivan, Brad', 'Ingman, Wendy V', 'Aplin, John D', 'Robertson, Sarah A']","['Jasper MJ', 'Care AS', 'Sullivan B', 'Ingman WV', 'Aplin JD', 'Robertson SA']","['Research Centre for Reproductive Health, School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. melinda.jasper@adelaide.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.69 (galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endothelium/cytology', 'Epithelial Cells/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Uterus/cytology']",2010/09/25 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.110.085399 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.110.085399 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2011 Jan;84(1):179-88. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.110.085399.

Some core complex components also form subcomplexes for yet-to-be-elucidated functions. Here, we have analyzed the interaction between a cytoplasmic FA subcomplex and the leukemic nucleophosmin (NPMc). Exogenous NPMc was degraded rapidly in FA acute myeloid leukemia bone marrow cells. Knockdown of FANCA or FANCC in leukemic OCI/AML3 cells induced rapid degradation of endogenous NPMc. NPMc degradation was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway involving the IBR-type RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase IBRDC2, and genetic correction of FA-A or FA-C lymphoblasts prevented NPMc ubiquitination. Moreover, cytoplasmic FANCA and FANCC formed a cytoplasmic complex and interacted with NPMc. Using a patient-derived FANCC mutant and a nuclearized FANCC, we demonstrated that the cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex was essential for NPMc stability. Finally, depletion of FANCA and FANCC in NPMc-positive leukemic cells significantly increased inflammation and chemoresistance through NF-kappaB activation. Our findings not only reveal the molecular mechanism involving cytoplasmic retention of NPMc but also suggest cytoplasmic function of FANCA and FANCC in NPMc-related leukemogenesis.","['Du, Wei', 'Li, Jie', 'Sipple, Jared', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Du W', 'Li J', 'Sipple J', 'Chen J', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', 'Ubiquitination']",2010/09/25 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)46719-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.113209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Nov 26;285(48):37436-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.113209.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prep1 action on insulin glucoregulatory function has been analyzed in liver of Prep1-hypomorphic mice (Prep1(i/i)), which express 2-3% of Prep1 mRNA. RESULTS: Based on euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies and measurement of glycogen content, livers from Prep1(i/i) mice feature increased sensitivity to insulin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of both insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 was significantly enhanced in Prep1(i/i) livers accompanied by a specific downregulation of the SYP and SHP1 tyrosine phosphatases. Prep1 overexpression in HepG2 liver cells upregulated SYP and SHP1 and inhibited insulin-induced IR and IRS1/2 phosphorylation and was accompanied by reduced glycogen content. Consistently, overexpression of the Prep1 partner Pbx1, but not of p160MBP, mimicked Prep1 effects on tyrosine phosphorylations, glycogen content, and on SYP and SHP1 expression. In Prep1 overexpressing cells, antisense silencing of SHP1, but not that of SYP, rescued insulin-dependent IR phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation. Both Prep1 and Pbx1 bind SHP1 promoter at a site located between nucleotides -2,113 and -1,778. This fragment features enhancer activity and induces luciferase function by 7-, 6-, and 30-fold, respectively, in response to Prep1, Pbx1, or both. CONCLUSIONS: SHP1, a known silencer of insulin signal, is a transcriptional target of Prep1. In liver, transcriptional activation of SHP1 gene by Prep1 attenuates insulin signal transduction and reduces glucose storage.","['Oriente, Francesco', 'Iovino, Salvatore', 'Cabaro, Serena', 'Cassese, Angela', 'Longobardi, Elena', 'Miele, Claudia', 'Ungaro, Paola', 'Formisano, Pietro', 'Blasi, Francesco', 'Beguinot, Francesco']","['Oriente F', 'Iovino S', 'Cabaro S', 'Cassese A', 'Longobardi E', 'Miele C', 'Ungaro P', 'Formisano P', 'Blasi F', 'Beguinot F']","['Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare, Istituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20100923,United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triglycerides)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Dietary Fats/pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*physiology', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Triglycerides/metabolism']",2010/09/25 06:00,2011/02/26 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['db10-0860 [pii]', '10.2337/db10-0860 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2011 Jan;60(1):138-47. doi: 10.2337/db10-0860.

Here, we analyzed a role of C/EBPalpha and PU.1 in human acute leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and NB4, in association with a modified chromatin structure by histone deacetylase inhibitors, FK228, sodium phenyl butyrate and vitamin B3. We found that sodium phenyl butyrate alone and 6h-pretreatment with phenyl butyrate or FK228 before the induction of differentiation with all-trans-retinoic acid in the presence of vitamin B3 effectively accelerated and enhanced differentiation to granulocytes in HL-60 but not in NB4 cells as detected by NBT test and the expression of CD11b and CD114 (G-CSFR) using flow cytometric analysis. HDACIs induced a time- and dose-dependent accumulation of hyper-acetylated histone H4 in both cell lines with the delay in NB4 cells. Time-dependent different induction of HL-60 and NB4 cell differentiation was paralleled by the activation of C/EBPalpha and PU.1 binding to the G-CSFR and the HNE promoters in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed histone H4 acetylation in the G-CSF receptor promoter at the C/EBPalpha binding site in HL-60 but not in NB4 cells under the combined treatment. The results indicate that epigenetic events, such as histone acetylation, are involved in the activity modulation of the key transcription factors responsible for the induction of granulocytic differentiation in promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['Savickiene, Jurate', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Vistartaite, Giedre', 'Tunaitis, Virginijus', 'Magnusson, Karl-Eric', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta']","['Savickiene J', 'Treigyte G', 'Vistartaite G', 'Tunaitis V', 'Magnusson KE', 'Navakauskiene R']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Mokslininku 12, LT-08662, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2010/09/25 06:00,2011/03/29 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-4681(10)00077-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.diff.2010.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2011 Jan;81(1):57-67. doi: 10.1016/j.diff.2010.08.003.

Although clinical features and genomic abnormalities in CLL have been studied extensively, molecular mechanisms underlying disease development are still emerging. In the last few years, several important insights were reported in this area. MiR-15/16 targeting BCL2 and MCL1 and DLEU7 targeting TNF pathway were proposed as tumor suppressors at 13q14, a commonly deleted region in indolent CLL.

Over the past two decades substantial data have accumulated regarding the restricted immunoglobulin (IG) gene repertoire in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and its potential implications for antigenic drive in the disease development and progression. Herein we discuss how evidence first illustrated a link between certain B cell receptor (BCR) specificities and disease outcome and the subsequent large-scale IG analyses which revealed the extent of ""stereotyped"" BCRs in CLL. More recent studies on CLL antibody reactivity have gradually provided clues as to which antigens may be involved in the tumor development. Significantly, CLL monoclonal antibodies have been shown to resemble natural antibodies recognizing molecular motifs both on apoptotic cells (e.g. modified cytoskeletal proteins and oxidation-specific epitopes), as well as exogenous bacteria, indicating that CLL clones possibly arise from B cells which have dual function as scavengers of apoptotic debris, while also having the ability to bind conserved bacterial cell structures. Such revelations have led us to re-evaluate both the phenotypic and functional characteristics of the tumor B cells and the pathway by which CLL arises and develops.","['Rosen, Anders', 'Murray, Fiona', 'Evaldsson, Chamilly', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Rosen A', 'Murray F', 'Evaldsson C', 'Rosenquist R']","['Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.

In previous study, micromolar bisabololoxide A, one of main constituents in German chamomile, exerted cytotoxic action on rat thymocyte, a normal non-proliferative cell. This result prompted us to study the effect of bisabololoxide A on proliferative cancer cells and to seek the possibility of its use with 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer agent. In this study, the effect of micromolar bisabololoxide A on human leukemia K562 cells was cytometrically examined. Although the incubation of K562 cells with 10 muM bisabololoxide A for 72h did not significantly increase the percentage populations of dead cells and shrunken cells, the inhibitory action on the growth was obviously observed. It was not the case for the concentrations of less than 5 muM. The threshold concentration of bisabololoxide A to exert the cytotoxic action on K562 cells was ascertained to be 5-10 muM. Bisabololoxide A at 5-10 muM did not exert cytotoxic action on normal non-proliferative cells (rat thymocytes) in our previous study. Since the antiproliferative action of micromolar bisabololoxide A on cancerous cells was expected to be beneficial to cancer treatment, the modification of antiproliferative action of 5-fluorouracil (3-30 muM) by bisabololoxide A was studied. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and bisabololoxide further inhibited the growth of K562 cells although the additive inhibition of growth by bisabololoxide A became smaller as the concentration of 5-fluorouracil increased. Therefore, it is suggested that the simultaneous application of German chamomile containing bisabololoxide A may reduce the dose of 5-fluorouracil.","['Ogata-Ikeda, Ikuko', 'Seo, Hakaru', 'Kawanai, Takuya', 'Hashimoto, Erika', 'Oyama, Yasuo']","['Ogata-Ikeda I', 'Seo H', 'Kawanai T', 'Hashimoto E', 'Oyama Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sojo University, Kumamoto, Japan. iogata@ph.sojo-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100921,Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '22567-36-8 (bisabololoxide A)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Flowers/chemistry', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Matricaria/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2010/09/25 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(10)00261-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2010.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2011 Mar 15;18(5):362-5. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2010.08.007.

Such a function however is lost during malignant transformation and CLL cells are well known for their inability to process and present antigens to the T-cell arm of the immune system. Instead, malignant CLL cells elicit a vast array of immune regulatory mechanisms conducive to T-cell dysfunction and immunosuppression. Previously, we have shown that treatment of CLL cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine unleashed target antigen expression. Here we show for the first time that combining two epigenetic modifiers, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor LAQ824 effectively restores the immunogenicity of CLL cell lines as well as primary cells obtained from CLL patients. Indeed, such a combination induces the expression of novel and highly antigenic cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) and costimulatory molecules. These changes facilitate the formation of robust supramolecular activation complexes (SMAC) between CLL cells and responder T-cells leading to intracellular signaling, lytic granule mobilization, and polarization of functional and relevant T-cell responses. This cascade of T-cell activating events triggered by CLL cells with restored APC function, points to combined epigenetic modifier treatment as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for CLL patients.","['Dubovsky, Jason A', 'Wang, Daniel', 'Powers, John J', 'Berchmans, Emmanuel', 'Smith, Matthew A', 'Wright, Kenneth L', 'Sotomayor, Eduardo M', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier A']","['Dubovsky JA', 'Wang D', 'Powers JJ', 'Berchmans E', 'Smith MA', 'Wright KL', 'Sotomayor EM', 'Pinilla-Ibarz JA']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, Immunology, and Experimental Therapeutics, H.

Death receptor 3 (DR3), a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily that is expressed on T cells and macrophages, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes through interaction with its cognate ligand, TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A). In order to find out whether the TL1A-induced inflammatory activation of macrophages is associated with the up-regulation of betaig-h3 expression, the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was stimulated with either recombinant human TL1A- or DR3-specific monoclonal antibodies. Stimulation of DR3 up-regulated the intracellular levels as well as the secretion of betaig-h3. Utilization of various inhibitors and Western blot analysis revealed that activation of protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide kinase-3 (PI3K), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) is required for TL1A-induced betaig-h3 expression. PKC appears to be the upstream regulator of PI3K since the presence of PKC inhibitor blocked the phosphorylation of AKT without affecting ERK phosphorylation. On the other hand, suppression of either PI3K or ERK activity resulted in the suppression of IkappaB phosphorylation. These findings indicate that TL1A can regulate the inflammatory processes through modulation of the betaig-h3 expression through two separate pathways, one through PKC and PI3K and the other through ERK, which culminates at NF-kappaB activation.","['Lee, Seung-Hee', 'Kim, Eun-Ju', 'Suk, Kyoungho', 'Kim, In-San', 'Lee, Won-Ha']","['Lee SH', 'Kim EJ', 'Suk K', 'Kim IS', 'Lee WH']","['Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF25 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF15 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 15)', '148710-76-3 (betaIG-H3 protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 15/*pharmacology']",2010/09/25 06:00,2010/12/30 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0008-8749(10)00230-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellimm.2010.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2010;266(1):61-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2010.08.013.

Hyperleukocytosis was controlled by low doses of the cytotoxic drugs, no unexpected toxicity appeared and the increases in normal peripheral blood cell counts induced by ATRA+valproic acid+theophylline were maintained during therapy.

In search for novel treatment strategies, we identified the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a potential drug target based on its effects on cell growth and survival. We have shown previously that AICAR-induced AMPK activation also induced a compensatory survival mechanism via PI3K/Akt signaling. RESULTS: In the present study, we further investigated the downstream signaling induced by AMPK activation in ALL cells. We found that AICAR-induced AMPK activation resulted in up-regulation of P-Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) and decrease of P-mTOR (Ser2448) expression and downstream signaling. We determined that activation of P-Akt (Thr308) was mediated by AMPK-induced IGF-1R activation via phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser794. Inhibition of IGF-1R signaling using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor HNMPA(AM)3 resulted in significant decrease in P-IRS-1 (Ser794) and P-Akt (Thr308). Co-treatment of AICAR plus HNMPA(AM)3 prevented AMPK-induced up-regulation of P-Akt (Thr308) but did not alter the activation of P-Akt (Ser473). Inhibition of AMPK using compound-C resulted in decreased P-Akt expression at both residues, suggesting a central role for AMPK in Akt activation. In addition, inhibition of IGF-1R signaling in ALL cells resulted in cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Additional Western blots revealed that P-IGF-1R (Tyr1131) and P-IRS-1 (Ser794) levels were higher in NALM6 (Bp-ALL) than CEM (T-ALL), and found differences in IGF-1R signaling within Bp-ALL cell line models NALM6, REH (TEL-AML1, [t(12;21)]), and SupB15 (BCR-ABL, [t(9;22)]). In these models, higher sensitivity to IGF-1R inhibitors correlated with increased levels of IGF-1R expression. Combined therapy simultaneously targeting IGF-1R, AMPK, Akt, and mTOR pathways resulted in synergistic growth inhibition and cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that AMPK activates Akt through IGF-1R dependent and independent mechanisms. Co-targeting IGF-1R and related downstream metabolic and oncogenic signaling pathways represent a potential strategy for future translation into novel ALL therapies.","['Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Leclerc, Guy J', 'Fu, Guilian', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Leclerc GM', 'Leclerc GJ', 'Fu G', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, 1601 N,W, 12th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136 USA. jbarredo@med.miami.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100923,England,J Mol Signal,Journal of molecular signaling,101271526,,,,2010/09/25 06:00,2010/09/25 06:01,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/25 06:01 [medline]']","['1750-2187-5-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-2187-5-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Mol Signal. 2010 Sep 23;5:15. doi: 10.1186/1750-2187-5-15.,,PMC2955666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL1 gene is mainly expressed in myeloid cells whereas quantification of BCR-ABL1 is performed on the nucleated cell fraction of peripheral blood. Hence, leukocyte composition of the nucleated cell fraction may affect the result of BCR-ABL1 quantification. The aim of this study was to investigate if changes in leukocyte composition of peripheral blood had any effect on BCR-ABL1 transcript levels in CML patients. Six CML patients in complete cytogenetic remission (CCgR) performed a maximal physical exercise test. Blood samples were collected before exercise, at maximal exhaustion and after exercise. A biphasic increase in leukocyte count was observed and the relative proportion of granulocytes in peripheral blood changed significantly after exercise compared with baseline (p < 0.001). The BCR-ABL1 transcript level increased significantly following exercise, in nucleated cell fraction of peripheral blood (p < 0.05) but not in isolated granulocytes. In the nucleated cell fraction, the mean BCR-ABL1 transcript level was 3.3-fold (range 0.7-6.8) higher 180 min after exercise compared with baseline (p < 0.01). In conclusion, physical exercise induced significant increases in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels concomitant with changes in leukocyte content of peripheral blood. We therefore suggest that variations in leukocyte composition of peripheral blood, causing pre-analytic variations that affect BCR-ABL1 quantification, have to be accounted for. Consequently, small variations in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels should be interpreted cautiously in CML patients in CCgR.","['Jonsson, Sofia', 'Olsson, Bob', 'Jacobsson, Stefan', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Ricksten, Anne', 'Ekeland-Sjoberg, Kerstin', 'Wadenvik, Hans']","['Jonsson S', 'Olsson B', 'Jacobsson S', 'Palmqvist L', 'Ricksten A', 'Ekeland-Sjoberg K', 'Wadenvik H']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg, Sweden. sofi a.jonsson@vgregion.se']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/25 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00365513.2010.521981 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2011 Feb;71(1):7-11. doi: 10.3109/00365513.2010.521981.

Bone marrow specimen from 200 children at different stages of acute leukemia and from 21 children without leukemia were studied. The WT1 expression at diagnostic marrow specimen in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) was higher than control group, whereas WT1 expression in AML was higher than in ALL, and WT1 expression level in relapse in ALL increased more significantly than in AML. The WT1 expression level showed positive correlation with the hypodiploidy and BCR-ABL fusion gene in acute leukemia. A rapidly decrease of WT1 expression level predicted a good response to the induction therapy and low expression of WT1 correlates with remission status. This study suggested that WT1 expression levels in acute leukemia can potentially be a marker for evaluating therapeutic efficacy, correlating with monitoring minimal residue disease, and predicting hematological relapse in children acute leukemia.","['Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Gu, Wei-Ying', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Wang, Xu-Li', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'He, Hai-Long', 'Chai, Yi-Huan', 'Chen, Chien-Shing']","['Hu SY', 'Gu WY', 'Chen ZX', 'Wang XL', 'Cen JN', 'He HL', 'Chai YH', 'Chen CS']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou City, China. shaoyanhu67@126.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2010/09/25 06:00,2011/02/17 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880011003762994 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Nov;27(8):581-91. doi: 10.3109/08880011003762994.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mucositis is defined as ""inflammatory lesions of the oral and/or gastrointestinal tract caused by high-dose cancer therapies. Alimentary tract mucositis refers to the expression of mucosal injury across the continuum of oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, from the mouth to the anus"" (Peterson, Bensadoun, & Roila, 2008, p. ii122). Evidence demonstrates that oral mucositis is quite distressing for patients. In addition, the majority of oncology nurses are unaware of available guidelines related to the care of oral mucositis. A multidisciplinary Oral Mucositis Committee was formed by the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics to develop evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies for adult and pediatric oncology patients experiencing oral mucositis. The first step was implementing an evidence-based nursing oral assessment. The Iowa Model was used to guide this evidence-based practice initiative. The Oral Assessment Guide (OAG) is reliable and valid, feasible, and sensitive to changing conditions. The OAG was piloted on an Adult Leukemia and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit leading to modification and adaptation. The pilot evaluation found 87% of patients had an abnormal oral assessment involving all categories in the tool. Nursing questionnaires showed that staff (8/23; 35% response) felt they were able to identify at risk patients using the OAG (3.3; 1-4 scale), and the tool accurately identifies mucosal changes (2.9; 1-4 scale). A knowledge assessment found nurses correctly identified OAG components 63% of the time. Unlike results from a national survey, most University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics nurses (63%) were aware of national guidelines for prevention and treatment of oral mucositis. Developing an evidence-based nursing policy and updating documentation systems was done before implementation occurred. Computer-based and printed educational materials were developed for nursing staff caring for oncology patients. Team members were responsible for facilitating adoption in clinical areas. After organizational roll out, the nursing assessment was documented in all patients 87% of the time, and 99% for inpatients. The highest risk population, head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation, had documentation in 88% of audited visits. Other clinics required further work. Changing the system to the electronic medical record created an additional need for integration of the evidence-based practice with housewide documentation of oral assessment being completed 60.9% of the time. Use of an evidence-based assessment is the first step in a comprehensive program to reduce a common and highly distressing side effect of cancer treatment. Nursing documentation of oral assessment is well integrated on inpatient units. Opportunities for improvement remain in ambulatory care. Multidisciplinary team collaborations to expand evidence-based assessment and research questions generated from this work will be shared.","['Farrington, Michele', 'Cullen, Laura', 'Dawson, Cindy']","['Farrington M', 'Cullen L', 'Dawson C']","[""University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, University of Iowa Children's Hospital Iowa City, Iowa, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,ORL Head Neck Nurs,ORL-head and neck nursing : official journal of the Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head-Neck Nurses,9206573,,,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Child', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis, Oral/methods', 'Documentation', 'Evidence-Based Nursing/education/*methods', 'Humans', 'Iowa', 'Models, Nursing', 'Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Nursing Assessment/*methods', 'Nursing Audit', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', 'Nursing Staff, Hospital/education/organization & administration', 'Oncology Nursing', 'Pediatric Nursing', 'Pilot Projects', 'Professional Staff Committees', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Stomatitis/*diagnosis/etiology/*nursing']",2010/09/25 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/25 06:00'],"['2010/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,ORL Head Neck Nurs. 2010 Summer;28(3):8-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with bevacizumab may further enhance the antitumor effect of docetaxel and estramustine in patients with CRPC. METHODS: This cooperative group trial enrolled men with CRPC. Patients received oral estramustine 280 mg 3 times daily on Days 1 through 5 of every cycle plus 70 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 15 mg/kg bevacizumab on Day 2 every 3 weeks. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were monitored every cycle, and imaging studies were obtained every 3 cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary objectives were safety, PSA decline, measurable disease response, and overall survival. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled; and 77 patients received a median of 8 cycles and were evaluable. A 50% PSA decline was observed in 58 patients (75%). Twenty-three of 39 patients with measurable disease had a partial response (59%). The median PFS was 8 months, and the overall median survival was 24 months. Neutropenia without fever (69%), fatigue (25%), and thrombosis/emboli (9%) were the most common severe toxicities. Twenty-four of 77 patients were removed from protocol treatment because of disease progression, 35 of 77 patients were removed because of a physician or patient decision, and 15 patients were removed secondary to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of docetaxel, estramustine, and bevacizumab was tolerable but complicated by toxicity. Although the endpoint of PFS did not meet the desired level, encouraging antitumor activity and overall survival were observed. Further phase 3 evaluation of the role of bevacizumab in CRPC is ongoing.","['Picus, Joel', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Kelly, W Kevin', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Whang, Young E', 'Kaplan, Ellen B', 'Stadler, Walter M', 'Small, Eric J']","['Picus J', 'Halabi S', 'Kelly WK', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Whang YE', 'Kaplan EB', 'Stadler WM', 'Small EJ']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA. picus@im.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100922,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', '35LT29625A (Estramustine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bevacizumab', 'Castration', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Docetaxel', 'Estramustine/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Taxoids/*administration & dosage', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25421 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Feb 1;117(3):526-33. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25421.

In a cell migration assay, M-[K(56)(CF)]SDF1alpha showed a clear potency to induce chemotaxis of human T-cell leukaemia cells. Microscopic analysis on HEK293 cells transfected with the CXCR4 revealed specific binding of the fluorescent ligand. Furthermore, receptor-induced internalisation of the ligand could be visualised. These results show that site-specific modification of SDF1alpha yields in a biologically functional molecule that allows the characterisation of CXCR4 production of cells on a molecular level.","['Bellmann-Sickert, Kathrin', 'Baumann, Lars', 'Beck-Sickinger, Annette G']","['Bellmann-Sickert K', 'Baumann L', 'Beck-Sickinger AG']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3301-79-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', '*Chemokine CXCL12/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Fluoresceins/*chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/psc.1228 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2010 Oct;16(10):568-74. doi: 10.1002/psc.1228.,,,"['(c) 2010 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as with arsenites found in drinking water and used as raw materials for wood preservatives, insecticides, and herbicides, low doses of ATO can induce carcinogenesis after long-term exposure. At 24 h after exposure, ATO (0.01-1 microM) significantly increased cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle progression from the G1 to S/G2 phases in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cell line. The expression of 14 out of 96 cell-cycle-associated genes significantly increased, and seven of these genes including cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) were closely related to cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Low-dose ATO steadily increased gene transcript and protein levels of both CDC6 and cyclin D1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Low-dose ATO produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activated the p38 MAPK, Akt, and ERK1/2 pathways at different time points within 60 min. Small molecular inhibitors and siRNAs inhibiting the activation of p38 MAPK, Akt, and ERK1/2 decreased the ATO-increased expression of CDC6 protein. Inhibiting the activation of Akt and ERK1/2, but not p38 MAPK, decreased the ATO-induced expression of cyclin D1 protein. This study reports for the first time that p38 MAPK/Akt/ERK1/2 activation is required for the protein stabilization of CDC6 in addition to cyclin D1 in ATO-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle modulation from G1 to S phase.","['Liu, Youhong', 'Hock, Janet M', 'Sullivan, Con', 'Fang, Geying', 'Cox, Allison J', 'Davis, Kathleen T', 'Davis, Bruce H', 'Li, Xiong']","['Liu Y', 'Hock JM', 'Sullivan C', 'Fang G', 'Cox AJ', 'Davis KT', 'Davis BH', 'Li X']","['Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health, 246 Sylvan Road, Maine 04401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CDC6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/03/23 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22886 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Dec 15;111(6):1546-55. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22886.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, discordances exist between the current prognostic factors, indicating that none of these factors are totally perfect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we compared the prognostic power of new RNA-based markers in order to construct a quantitative PCR (qPCR) score composed of the most powerful factors. ZAP70, LPL, CLLU1, microRNA-29c and microRNA-223 were measured by real time PCR in a cohort of 170 patients with a median follow-up of 64 months (range3-330). For each patient, cells were obtained at diagnosis and RNA was extracted from purified CD19 cells. The best markers were included in a qPCR score, which was thereafter compared to each individual factor. Statistical analysis showed that all five RNA-based markers can predict treatment-free survival (TFS), but only ZAP70, LPL and microRNA-29c could significantly predict overall survival (OS). These three markers were thus included in a simple qPCR score that was able to significantly predict TFS and OS by dividing patients into three groups (0/3, 1-2/3 and 3/3). Median TFS were >210, 61 and 24 months (P<0.0001) and median OS were >330, 242 and 137 months (P<0.0001), respectively. Interestingly, TFS results were also confirmed in Binet stage A patients (P<0.0001). When compared to other classical factors, this score displays the highest univariate Cox hazard ratio (TFS: HR=9.45 and OS: HR=13.88) but also provides additional prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: In our hands, this score is the most powerful tool for CLL risk stratification at the time of diagnosis.","['Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'De Bruyn, Cecile', 'Pieters, Karlien', 'Anthoine, Geraldine', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Stamatopoulos B', 'Meuleman N', 'De Bruyn C', 'Pieters K', 'Anthoine G', 'Mineur P', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. bstamato@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012780 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Sep 16;5(9). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012780.,,PMC2940823,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to assess response to imatinib mesylate (Glivec) in Cote d'Ivoire patients with newly diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). From May 2005 to September 2009, we treated 42 patients (40 years; range 16-69) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) positive in chronic phase CML with oral imatinib mesylate at daily doses of 400 mg. Overall survival (OS) and frequency of complete or major cytogenetic remission (CCR/MCR) were evaluated. At a median follow up of 32 (range 7.6-113) months, the CHR rate in our study group was 76%. A major CR was found in 19 patients (45%) with 17% and 29% complete and partial CR respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of major cytogenetic response by known prognostics factors. Median time to CHR was 8 months (range 0.4-25), and 16 months (range: 0.1-36) for CR. Projected 5-year OS rate was 72% (95%CI 42-88).

Although this pathway is frequently targeted in cancer, no significant alterations have yet been identified in CLL. We now show that the phosphatase PH domain leucin-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP1), a recently identified tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the Akt kinase, is absent or expressed at substantially reduced levels in CLL B-cells. To determine what the consequences of PHLPP1 loss on BCR signaling are, we downregulated or re-expressed PHLPP1 in lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL B-cells, respectively. Downregulation of PHLPP1 increased BCR-induced phosphorylation and activation of the Akt, GSK3 and ERK kinases, whereas re-expression had the opposite effect. Importantly, re-expression of PHLPP1 in primary CLL cells prevented upregulation of Mcl-1 and inhibited the increase in leukemic cell viability induced by sustained BCR engagement. Enforced expression of PHLPP1 also affected the response to other microenvironmental stimuli, particularly in terms of ERK phosphorylation. Collectively, these data show that CLL cells lack an important negative regulator of the Akt and ERK pathways, which could confer them a growth advantage by facilitating the propagation of crucial microenvironment-derived stimuli.","['Suljagic, M', 'Laurenti, L', 'Tarnani, M', 'Alam, M', 'Malek, S N', 'Efremov, D G']","['Suljagic M', 'Laurenti L', 'Tarnani M', 'Alam M', 'Malek SN', 'Efremov DG']","['Department of Molecular Hematology, ICGEB, Campus Adriano Buzzati-Traverso, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010201 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.201 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Dec;24(12):2063-71. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.201.

Changes in Gfi1 expression and function have not only been implicated in neutropenia, allergy, autoimmunity and hyperinflammatory responses, but also in lymphoma and more recently in the development of leukemia. In this study, we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of these proteins.","['van der Meer, L T', 'Jansen, J H', 'van der Reijden, B A']","['van der Meer LT', 'Jansen JH', 'van der Reijden BA']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100923,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology']",2010/09/24 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010195 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.195 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1834-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.195.

We recently reported differences in prognosis between the different translocation partners, suggesting differences in biological background. To unravel the latter, we used microarrays to generate gene expression profiles of 245 pediatric AML cases, including 53 MLL-rearranged cases. Thereby, we identified a specific gene expression signature for t(9;11)(p22;q23), and identified BRE (brain and reproductive organ expressed) to be discriminative for t(9;11)(p22;q23) (P<0.001) when compared with other MLL subtypes. Patients with high BRE expression showed a significantly better 3-year relapse-free survival (pRFS) (80+/-13 vs 30+/-10%, P=0.02) within MLL-rearranged AML cases. Moreover, multivariate analysis identified high BRE expression as an independent favorable prognostic factor within pediatric AML for RFS (HR=0.2, P=0.04). No significant differences were identified for 3-year event-free survival or for 3-year overall survival. Forced expression of BRE did not result in altered cell proliferation, apoptosis or drug sensitivity, which could explain the favorable outcome. In conclusion, overexpression of the BRE gene is predominantly found in MLL-rearranged AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23). Although further investigation for the role of BRE in leukemogenesis and outcome is warranted, high BRE expression is an independent prognostic factor for pRFS in pediatric AML.","['Balgobind, B V', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Arentsen-Peters, T J C M', 'Hollink, I H I M', 'de Haas, V', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'de Bont, E S J M', 'Baruchel, A', 'Stary, J', 'Meyer, C', 'Marschalek, R', 'Creutzig, U', 'den Boer, M L', 'Pieters, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['Balgobind BV', 'Zwaan CM', 'Reinhardt D', 'Arentsen-Peters TJ', 'Hollink IH', 'de Haas V', 'Kaspers GJ', 'de Bont ES', 'Baruchel A', 'Stary J', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Creutzig U', 'den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BABAM2 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010211 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.211 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Dec;24(12):2048-55. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.211.

We have focused on DNA fusion gene vaccines, coupling fragment C domain (DOM) of tetanus toxin with PASD1 sequence, and examined efficacy in Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A2 (HHD) transgenic mice using a human MM cell line expressing PASD1 protein and chimeric HLA-A2 class I molecules as target. DNA vaccines encoded two HLA-A2-restricted epitopes (p.DOM-PASD1(1), p.DOM-PASD1(2)) and full-length PASD1 (p.DOM-PASD1FL). p.DOM-PASD1(1) proved superior to p.DOM-PASD1(2) in generating T-cell responses in HHD mice, able to lyse the chimeric murine RMA-HHD cells. Boosting by electroporation significantly enhanced p.DOM-PASD1(1). Only p.DOM-PASD1(1) induced cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) were able to lyse human MM target cells expressing endogenous antigen. The p.DOM-PASD1FL vaccine predominantly induced strong PASD1(1) over PASD1(2) T-cell immune responses, indicative of immunodominance.

We retrospectively investigated the relevance of NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations for pediatric T-ALL patients enrolled on Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL7/8 or ALL9 or the German Co-Operative Study Group for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia study (COALL-97) protocols. NOTCH1-activating mutations were identified in 63% of patients. NOTCH1 mutations affected the heterodimerization, the juxtamembrane and/or the PEST domains, but not the RBP-J-kappa-associated module, the ankyrin repeats or the transactivation domain. Reverse-phase protein microarray data confirmed that NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations resulted in increased intracellular NOTCH1 levels in primary T-ALL biopsies. Based on microarray expression analysis, NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations were associated with activation of NOTCH1 direct target genes including HES1, DTX1, NOTCH3, PTCRA but not cMYC. NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations were associated with TLX3 rearrangements, but were less frequently identified in TAL1- or LMO2-rearranged cases. NOTCH1-activating mutations were less frequently associated with mature T-cell developmental stage. Mutations were associated with a good initial in vivo prednisone response, but were not associated with a superior outcome in the DCOG and COALL cohorts. Comparing our data with other studies, we conclude that the prognostic significance for NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations is not consistent and may depend on the treatment protocol given.","['Zuurbier, L', 'Homminga, I', 'Calvert, V', 'te Winkel, M L', 'Buijs-Gladdines, J G C A M', 'Kooi, C', 'Smits, W K', 'Sonneveld, E', 'Veerman, A J P', 'Kamps, W A', 'Horstmann, M', 'Petricoin, E F 3rd', 'Pieters, R', 'Meijerink, J P P']","['Zuurbier L', 'Homminga I', 'Calvert V', 'te Winkel ML', 'Buijs-Gladdines JG', 'Kooi C', 'Smits WK', 'Sonneveld E', 'Veerman AJ', 'Kamps WA', 'Horstmann M', 'Petricoin EF 3rd', 'Pieters R', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100923,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010204 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.204 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Dec;24(12):2014-22. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.204.

This is particularly relevant to cancer chemotherapy, when the risk of toxicity must be balanced against potential suboptimal (low) systemic exposure that can be less effective in patients with higher rates of drug clearance. The purpose of this review is to discuss genetic factors that lead to interpatient differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these medications. RECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide agonistic studies of pediatric patient populations are revealing genome variations that may affect susceptibility to specific diseases and that influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of medications. Several genetic factors with relatively small effect may be combined in the determination of a pharmacogenomic phenotype and considering these polygenic models may be mandatory in order to predict the related drug response phenotypes. These findings have potential to yield new insights into disease pathogenesis, and lead to molecular diagnostics that can be used to optimize the treatment of childhood cancers. SUMMARY: Advances in genome technology, and their comprehensive and systematic deployment to elucidate the genomic basis of interpatient differences in drug response and disease risk, hold great promise to ultimately enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of drug therapy in children.","['Paugh, Steven W', 'Stocco, Gabriele', 'Evans, William E']","['Paugh SW', 'Stocco G', 'Evans WE']","[""Hematological Malignancies Program and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833fde85 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2010 Dec;22(6):703-10. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833fde85.,"['R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA141762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM0922666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA141762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3612020,,,,,,['NIHMS446197'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared 10 relapse and 11 t-MN cases that developed in 108 patients during their first complete remission from APL. At APL diagnosis, t-MN patients had lower white blood cell counts than did relapse patients (P = .048). Overall survival starting from chemotherapy was significantly worse in t-MN patients than in relapse patients (P = .022). The t-MN cases were characterized as CD34(+)/HLA-DR(+) and PML-RARA(-), and 4 RUNX1/AML1 mutations were detected.

There is inconsistent evidence on associations between ALL and other parental or childhood diagnostic irradiation. The aim of this analysis is to investigate whether diagnostic X-rays of the mother before birth, of the father before conception, or of the child increased the risk of childhood ALL. METHODS: Data from 389 cases and 876 frequency-matched controls were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for study matching factors and potential confounders. A meta-analysis of our findings in relation to paternal X-rays before conception with the published findings of previous studies was also conducted. RESULTS: There was no evidence of an increased risk with maternal abdominal X-rays before the birth of the index child or with the child having any X-rays more than 6 months before the censoring date. The odds ratio (OR) for any paternal abdominal X-ray before conception was 1.17 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.88-1.55], and 1.47 (95% CI, 0.98-2.21) for more than one X-ray. The OR for any paternal intravenous pyelogram before conception was 3.56 (95% CI, 1.59-7.98). The pooled OR for this study with previous studies of any paternal abdominal X-rays before conception was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.92-1.48). CONCLUSIONS: There was some evidence of an increased risk of ALL in the offspring if the father had more than one abdominal X-ray before conception or had ever had an intravenous pyelogram. IMPACT: We plan to repeat this analysis by using pooled data to improve precision.","['Bailey, Helen D', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Attia, John', 'Lockwood, Liane', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Bailey HD', 'Armstrong BK', 'de Klerk NH', 'Fritschi L', 'Attia J', 'Lockwood L', 'Milne E']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia. helenb@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Mothers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy/*radiation effects', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'X-Rays/adverse effects']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-10-0542 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0542 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Nov;19(11):2897-909. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0542.

During viral infection, E1B-55K and E4orf6 substitute for the substrate-binding subunits of the host cell cullin 5 class of ubiquitin ligases, resulting in p53 polyubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. Here we show that E1B-55K alone also functions as an E3 SUMO1-p53 ligase. Fluorescence microscopy studies showed that E1B-55K alone, in the absence of other viral proteins, causes p53 to colocalize with E1B-55K in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, nuclear domains with a high concentration of sumoylated proteins. Photobleaching experiments with live cells revealed that E1B-55K tethering of p53 in PML nuclear bodies decreases the in vivo nuclear mobility of p53 nearly 2 orders of magnitude. E1B-55K-induced p53 sumoylation contributes to maximal inhibition of p53 function since mutation of the major p53 sumoylation site decreases E1B-55K-induced p53 sumoylation, tethering in PML nuclear bodies, and E1B-55K inhibition of p53 activity. Mutation of the E1B-55K sumoylation site greatly inhibits E1B-55K association with PML nuclear bodies and the p53 nuclear export to cytoplasmic aggresomes observed in E1A-E1B-transformed cells. Purified E1B-55K and p53 form high-molecular-weight complexes potentially through the formation of a network of E1B-55K dimers bound to the N termini of p53 tetramers. In support of this model, a p53 mutation that prevents tetramer formation greatly reduces E1B-55K-induced tethering in PML nuclear bodies and p53 nuclear export. These data indicate that E1B-55K's association with PML nuclear bodies inactivates p53 by first sequestering it in PML nuclear bodies and then greatly facilitating its nuclear export.","['Pennella, Mario A', 'Liu, Yue', 'Woo, Jennifer L', 'Kim, Chongwoo A', 'Berk, Arnold J']","['Pennella MA', 'Liu Y', 'Woo JL', 'Kim CA', 'Berk AJ']","['Molecular Biology Institute and Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100922,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Photobleaching', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2010/09/24 06:00,2010/12/21 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01442-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01442-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Dec;84(23):12210-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01442-10.

We had previously shown that MDR1 transcription is regulated by epigenetic events such as histone acetylation, and had identified the histone acetylase P/CAF and the transcription factor NF-Y as the factors mediating the enzymatic and DNA-anchoring functions, respectively, at the MDR1 promoter. It has also been shown that MDR1 activation is accompanied by increased methylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4). In this study, we further investigated histone methylation in MDR1 regulation and function. We show that the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein, a histone methyltransferase specific for H3K4, is required for MDR1 promoter methylation, as knockdown of MLL1 resulted in a decrease in MDR1 expression. The regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 has functional consequences in that downregulation of MLL1 led to increased retention of the Pgp-specific substrate DIOC(2)(3), as well as increased cellular sensitivity to several Pgp substrates. Regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 was dependent on the CCAAT box within the proximal MDR1 promoter, similar to what we had shown for MDR1 promoter acetylation, and also requires NF-Y. Finally, overexpression of the most prevalent MLL fusion protein, MLL-AF4, led to increased MDR1 expression. This is the first identification of a histone methyltransferase and its leukemogenic rearrangement that regulates expression of an ABC drug transporter, suggesting a new target for circumvention of tumor multidrug resistance.","['Huo, Hairong', 'Magro, Pellegrino G', 'Pietsch, E Christy', 'Patel, Brijesh B', 'Scotto, Kathleen W']","['Huo H', 'Magro PG', 'Pietsch EC', 'Patel BB', 'Scotto KW']","['Department of Pharmacology, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100922,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",2010/09/24 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-0755 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0755 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 1;70(21):8726-35. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0755.

In a mouse model of one such oncogene, LMO2, the cellular effect is to induce self-renewal of committed T cells in the thymus, which persist long-term while acquiring additional mutations and eventually giving rise to leukemia. These precancerous stem cells (pre-CSC) are intrinsically resistant to radiotherapy, implying that they may be refractory to conventional cancer therapies. However, they depend on an aberrantly expressed stem cell-like self-renewal program for their maintenance, in addition to a specialized thymic microenvironmental niche. Here, we discuss potential approaches for targeting pre-CSCs in T-ALL by using therapies directed at oncogenic transcription factors themselves, downstream self-renewal pathways, and the supportive cell niche.","['Curtis, David J', 'McCormack, Matthew P']","['Curtis DJ', 'McCormack MP']","['Rotary Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100922,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/metabolism/pathology']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0440 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0440 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Dec 1;16(23):5618-23. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0440.

A population-based study.,1028-33,10.1093/aje/kwq262 [doi],"The authors used cancer registry data to assess the incidence rate of second primary cancers among chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and the long-term survival of CML patients before the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the Swedish Cancer Registry, the authors identified 2,753 adult CML patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1995 who were followed through December 2007. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and relative survival ratios were computed. With a total of 145 subsequent primary malignancies, an increased incidence rate of second malignancy was found for stomach cancer (SIR = 2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33, 5.08), skin cancer (SIR = 5.36, 95% CI: 3.18, 8.47), urogenital tract cancer (SIR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.21), and lymphoid leukemia (SIR = 5.53, 95% CI: 1.79, 12.89). Long-term relative survival figures showed that CML was related, in the era prior to the introduction of imatinib, to a very steep decline in survival (2 years from diagnosis, relative survival = 51%, 95% CI: 49, 53). This was in spite of a marginal improvement after 1985, possibly related to the introduction of interferon-alpha for treatment. These estimates constitute a relevant reference for future studies and a benchmark for comparisons with prognosis in CML patients after chronic use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Rebora, Paola', 'Czene, Kamila', 'Antolini, Laura', 'Gambacorti Passerini, Carlo', 'Reilly, Marie', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Rebora P', 'Czene K', 'Antolini L', 'Gambacorti Passerini C', 'Reilly M', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Medicine and Prevention, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality']",2010/09/24 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['kwq262 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwq262 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2010 Nov 1;172(9):1028-33. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwq262.

Such networks often include unconnected components, which popular network alignment algorithms place arbitrarily with respect to the rest of the network. This can lead to misinterpretations due to the proximity of otherwise unrelated elements. RESULTS: We propose a new network layout optimization technique called FragViz which can incorporate additional information on relations between unconnected network components. It uses a two-step approach by first arranging the nodes within each of the components and then placing the components so that their proximity in the network corresponds to their relatedness. In the experimental study with the leukemia gene networks we demonstrate that FragViz can obtain network layouts which are more interpretable and hold additional information that could not be exposed using classical network layout optimization algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Network visualization relies on computational techniques for proper placement of objects under consideration. These algorithms need to be fast so that they can be incorporated in responsive interfaces required by the explorative data analysis environments. Our layout optimization technique FragViz meets these requirements and specifically addresses the visualization of fragmented networks, for which standard algorithms do not consider similarities between unconnected components. The experiments confirmed the claims on speed and accuracy of the proposed solution.","['Stajdohar, Miha', 'Mramor, Minca', 'Zupan, Blaz', 'Demsar, Janez']","['Stajdohar M', 'Mramor M', 'Zupan B', 'Demsar J']","['Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Software', 'Systems Biology', 'User-Computer Interface']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-475 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-475 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Sep 22;11:475. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-475.,,PMC2955700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only limited information regarding the allergenic activity of individual cow's milk allergens is available. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the frequency of IgE reactivity and to determine the allergenic activity of individual cow's milk allergens. METHODS: A nitrocellulose-based microarray, based on purified natural and recombinant cow's milk allergens was used to determine IgE reactivity profiles using sera from 78 cow's milk-sensitized individuals of varying ages. The allergenic activity of the individual allergens was tested using patients' sera for loading rat basophil leukaemia cells (RBL) expressing the alpha-chain of the human receptor FcepsilonRI. RESULTS: Using the microarray and the RBL assay, cow's milk allergens were assessed for frequency of IgE recognition and allergenic activity. Moreover, the RBL assay allowed distinguishing individuals without or with mild clinical reactions from those with severe systemic or gastrointestinal symptoms as well as persons who grew out cow's milk allergy from those who did not.

We examined the energy metabolism of four leukemia cell lines by using glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) and inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, oligomycin. NB4 was relatively sensitive to 2-DG (IC(50): 5.75 mM), consumed more glucose and produced more lactate (waste product of glycolysis) than the three other cell lines. Consequently, NB4 was considered as a ""glycolytic"" leukemia cell line. Dependency on glycolysis in NB4 was confirmed by the fact that glucose (+) FCS (-) medium showed more growth and survival than glucose (-) FCS (+) medium. Alternatively, THP-1, most resistant to 2-DG (IC(50): 16.14 mM), was most sensitive to oligomycin. Thus, THP-1 was recognized to be dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. In THP-1, glucose (-) FCS (+) medium showed more growth and survival than glucose (+) FCS (-) medium. The dependency of THP-1 on FCS was explained, at least partly, by fatty acid oxidation because inhibitor of fatty acid beta-oxidation, etomoxir, augmented the growth suppression of THP-1 by 2-DG. We also examined the mechanisms by which THP-1 was resistant to, and NB4 was sensitive to 2-DG treatment. In THP-1, AMP kinase (AMPK), which is activated when ATP becomes limiting, was rapidly phosphorylated by 2-DG, and expression of Bcl-2 was augmented, which might result in resistance to 2-DG. On the other hand, AMPK phosphorylation and augmentation of Bcl-2 expression by 2-DG were not observed in NB4, which is 2-DG sensitive.

This enabled simple, rapid, and label-free protein kinase assays via MALDI-TOF MS detection of substrate peptide phosphorylation. Abltide, a model substrate for the Abl protein tyrosine kinase model, was coupled onto amine-terminated beads, incubated with ATP and recombinant c-Abl kinase, and released and further detected to determine phosphorylation. Abltide phosphorylation was found to depend significantly on the length and composition of linkers to the bead surface. Inserting a diblock spacer of poly(glycine) and poly(ethylene glycol) segments markedly enhanced phosphorylation. To validate the assay, the activity of two small-molecule kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, which target the oncogenic mutant tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), was tested. Examining inhibition of the purified c-Abl or Bcr-Abl in K562 CML cell extracts, IC(50) values were determined to be consistent with the literature. This simple, label-free, MALDI-based protein kinase assay can be readily adapted to allow multiplexed assays of multiple peptide substrates and/or analysis of alternative post-translational modifications as a tool for drug discovery and clinical testing.","['Zhou, Guangchang', 'Yan, Xiaoliang', 'Wu, Ding', 'Kron, Stephen J']","['Zhou G', 'Yan X', 'Wu D', 'Kron SJ']","['Ludwig Center for Metastasis Research, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Enzyme Assays/*methods', 'Fluorenes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Magnetics', '*Microspheres', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*chemistry', '*Photochemical Processes', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/*methods']",2010/09/24 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/09/24 06:00'],"['2010/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc1003058 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2010 Oct 20;21(10):1917-24. doi: 10.1021/bc1003058.,"['GM074691/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HG003864/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA126764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG003864/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM074691/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA126764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4562279,,,,,,['NIHMS720296'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with short-term follow-up failed to identify an excess of cardiac events, but longer-term observations are needed to more definitely exclude this adverse effect. This study was designed to assess the cardiac effects of imatinib in patients under long-term treatment. We included 90 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients under imatinib therapy for a median treatment time of 3.3 years (mean age 48.9 +/- 15.1 years). Patients underwent clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, echocardiography (two-dimensional, colour flow, tissue Doppler and strain imaging), brain natiuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I measurements. Twenty healthy volunteers were included as a control group for strain measurements. The mean ejection fraction was 68 +/- 7% and the median BNP level was 9.6 pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 5.7-17.0 pg/ml). Two patients had either an elevated BNP or a depressed ejection fraction (2.2%; 90%CI 0.9-6.8%). Most of troponin I measurements were lower than the detection limit, except for two patients. Longitudinal strain was similar to measurements in healthy controls. A weak relation was observed between log BNP and imatinib treatment duration and dose. There was no relation between these variables and left ventricle ejection fraction. In conclusion, matinib-related cardiotoxicity is an uncommon event in CML patients, even during long-term treatment. Therefore, its use should not be cause of great concern, and the usefulness of regular cardiac monitoring all patients while on imatinib therapy is questionable.","['Marcolino, Milena S', 'Boersma, Eric', 'Clementino, Nelma C D', 'Nunes, Maria do Carmo P', 'Barbosa, Marcia M', 'Silva, Maria Helena C R', 'Geleijnse, Marcel L', 'Ribeiro, Antonio L']","['Marcolino MS', 'Boersma E', 'Clementino NC', 'Nunes Mdo C', 'Barbosa MM', 'Silva MH', 'Geleijnse ML', 'Ribeiro AL']","['School of Medicine, Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. milenamarc@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Heart Failure/blood/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.967 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2011 Sep;29(3):124-30. doi: 10.1002/hon.967.

PROCEDURE: Tipifarnib was administered twice daily for 21 days, repeated every 28 days starting at a dose of 300 mg/m(2) /dose. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed for 36 hr after the first dose and leukemic blasts were collected pre-treatment and at steady state for determination of FTase activity. RESULTS: Of 29 patients enrolled, 18 were fully evaluable for toxicity, and 23 for response; 26 had pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling. The recommended dose is 300 mg/m(2) /dose and toxicities included skin rash, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Neurotoxicity, which was dose-limiting in adults at doses exceeding 600 mg/dose, was infrequent and mild. The plasma pharmacokinetics of tipifarnib were highly variable but comparable to adults with acute leukemia and children with solid tumors. The median apparent clearance of tipifarnib was 630 ml/min/m(2) and the median half-life was 4.7 hr. At steady state on 300 mg/m(2) /dose, FTase activity was inhibited by 82% in leukemic blasts. No objective responses were observed.

However, little is known about the trajectory of body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure over the course of ALL therapy. PROCEDURE: In a retrospective cohort of 183 pediatric ALL patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2008, prevalence, severity, and risk factors for obesity and hypertension were assessed during treatment. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 36% of patients were overweight and 19% were obese. Median BMI increased during induction therapy with a return to baseline soon after, but increased again over the first 22 months of maintenance therapy. At the end of therapy, 49% were overweight and 21% were obese. Increased BMI z-score at diagnosis was associated with increased z-score during maintenance (P < 0.001). Elevated parental BMI was associated with elevated BMI at diagnosis. Median BMI z-score increased over the first 22 months of maintenance (P < 0.001). Patients with high risk disease had lower BMI z-scores regardless of cranial radiotherapy exposure (P < 0.001). Pre-hypertension was prevalent over the course of therapy (31.1% with systolic pre-hypertension and 18.6% with diastolic pre-hypertension). Hypertension was also highly prevalent with 41.5% meeting systolic criteria and 24.0% meeting diastolic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: During ALL therapy, patients are at risk for early development of elevated BMI and blood pressure, which places them at potentially increased risk for future adverse health conditions. Future studies are needed to develop strategies to mitigate these risks, such as potential reduction of corticosteroid pulses or a family-based diet and exercise intervention during maintenance therapy.","['Esbenshade, Adam J', 'Simmons, Jill H', 'Koyama, Tatsuki', 'Koehler, Elizabeth', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Friedman, Debra L']","['Esbenshade AJ', 'Simmons JH', 'Koyama T', 'Koehler E', 'Whitlock JA', 'Friedman DL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.

We have used Design of Experiments (DoE) methods to investigate the composition of a serum-free chemically defined culture medium for expansion of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Factor screening analysis according to Plackett-Burman revealed that insulin and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) had a significant positive influence on the proliferation activity of the cells, while zinc and L: -cysteine reduced the cell growth. Further analysis using minimum run resolution IV (MinRes IV) design indicates that following factor adjustment LIF becomes the main factor for the survival and proliferation of mESC. In conclusion, DoE screening assays are applicable to develop and to refine culture media for stem cells and could also be employed to optimize culture media for human embryonic stem cells (hESC).","['Knospel, Fanny', 'Schindler, Rudolf K', 'Lubberstedt, Marc', 'Petzolt, Stephanie', 'Gerlach, Jorg C', 'Zeilinger, Katrin']","['Knospel F', 'Schindler RK', 'Lubberstedt M', 'Petzolt S', 'Gerlach JC', 'Zeilinger K']","['Division of Experimental Surgery, Biomedical Research Center, Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charite Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany, fanny.knoespel@charite.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100922,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,,2010/09/23 06:00,2010/09/23 06:01,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10616-010-9307-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2010 Dec;62(6):557-71. doi: 10.1007/s10616-010-9307-8.

But there was no statistical significance between low-grade MDS and the control group (P = 0.496). Furthermore, we measured SDF-1 levels in BM plasma from patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and no difference was found. We found a negative correlation between apoptosis and CXCR4 expression.

Various strategies are being explored in manufacturing DC vaccines ex vivo, e.g., monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated antigens (LAA). However, the optimal source of LAA and the choice of DC-activating stimuli are still not well defined. Here, loading with leukemic cell preparations (harboring both unknown and known LAA) was explored in combination with a DC maturation-inducing cytokine cocktail (CC; IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and PGE(2)) and Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L) to optimize uptake. Since heat shock induced apoptotic blasts were more efficiently taken up than lysates, we focused on uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells. Uptake of apoptotic blast was further enhanced by the TLR7/8-L R848 (20-30%); in contrast, CC-induced maturation inhibited uptake. CC, and to a lesser extent R848, enhanced the ability of MoDC to migrate and stimulate T cells. Furthermore, class II-associated invariant chain peptide expression was down-modulated after R848- or CC-induced maturation, indicating enhanced processing and presentation of antigenic peptides. To improve both uptake and maturation, leukemic cells and MoDC were co-incubated with R848 for 24 h followed by addition of CC. However, this approach interfered with CC-mediated MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migratory and T cell stimulatory capacity, and the absence of IL-12 production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that even though R848 improved uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells, the sequential use of R848 and CC is counter-indicated due to its adverse effects on MoDC maturation.","['van den Ancker, Willemijn', 'van Luijn, Marvin M', 'Ruben, Jurjen M', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['van den Ancker W', 'van Luijn MM', 'Ruben JM', 'Westers TM', 'Bontkes HJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'de Gruijl TD', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU Institute for Cancer and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. w.vandenancker@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', '0 (invariant chain)', 'V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/drug effects', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/agonists', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/agonists']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0917-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Jan;60(1):37-47. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0917-y.

We explored whether BCAR4 is predictive for tamoxifen resistance and prognostic for tumour aggressiveness, and studied its function. METHODS: BCAR4 mRNA levels were measured in primary breast tumours, and evaluated for association with progression-free survival (PFS) and clinical benefit in patients with oestrogen receptor (ERalpha)-positive tumours receiving tamoxifen as first-line monotherapy for advanced disease. In a separate cohort of patients with lymph node-negative, ERalpha-positive cancer, and not receiving systemic adjuvant therapy, BCAR4 levels were evaluated for association with distant metastasis-free survival (MFS). The function of BCAR4 was studied with immunoblotting and RNA interference in a cell model. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses established high BCAR4 mRNA levels as an independent predictive factor for poor PFS after start of tamoxifen therapy for recurrent disease. High BCAR4 mRNA levels were associated with poor MFS and overall survival, reflecting tumour aggressiveness. In BCAR4-expressing cells, phosphorylation of v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB)2, ERBB3, and their downstream mediators extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) 1/2, was increased. Selective knockdown of ERBB2 or ERBB3 inhibited proliferation, confirming their role in BCAR4-induced tamoxifen resistance. CONCLUSION: BCAR4 may have clinical relevance for tumour aggressiveness and tamoxifen resistance. Our cell model suggests that BCAR4-positive breast tumours are driven by ERBB2/ERBB3 signalling. Patients with such tumours may benefit from ERBB-targeted therapy.","['Godinho, M F E', 'Sieuwerts, A M', 'Look, M P', 'Meijer, D', 'Foekens, J A', 'Dorssers, L C J', 'van Agthoven, T']","['Godinho MF', 'Sieuwerts AM', 'Look MP', 'Meijer D', 'Foekens JA', 'Dorssers LC', 'van Agthoven T']","['Department of Pathology, Josephine Nefkens Institute, Erasmus MC-University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, 3000 CA, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (BCAR4 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/analysis/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Untranslated', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tamoxifen/*therapeutic use']",2010/09/23 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['6605884 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605884 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Oct 12;103(8):1284-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605884.

Mutations at the C-terminal domain of NPM1 are the most frequent genetic lesion in acute myeloid leukemia and cause the aberrant and stable translocation of the protein in the cytoplasm. The NPM1 C-terminal domain was previously shown to bind nucleic acids. Here we further investigate the DNA binding properties of the NPM1 C-terminal domain both at the protein and nucleic acid levels; we investigate the domain boundaries and identify key residues for high affinity recognition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NPM1 C-terminal domain has a preference for G-quadruplex forming DNA regions and induces the formation of G-quadruplex structures in vitro. Finally we show that a specific sequence found at the SOD2 gene promoter, which was previously shown to be a target of NPM1 in vivo, is indeed folded as a G-quadruplex in vitro under physiological conditions. Our data extend considerably present knowledge on the DNA binding properties of NPM1 and suggest a general role in the transcription of genes characterized by the presence of G-quadruplex forming regions at their promoters.","['Federici, Luca', 'Arcovito, Alessandro', 'Scaglione, Giovanni L', 'Scaloni, Flavio', 'Lo Sterzo, Carlo', 'Di Matteo, Adele', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Giardina, Bruno', 'Brunori, Maurizio']","['Federici L', 'Arcovito A', 'Scaglione GL', 'Scaloni F', 'Lo Sterzo C', 'Di Matteo A', 'Falini B', 'Giardina B', 'Brunori M']","[""Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Chieti G D'Annunzio, CeSI Center of Excellence on Aging, 66013 Chieti, Italy. lfederici@unich.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', '*G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2010/09/23 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)46690-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.166736 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Nov 26;285(48):37138-49. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.166736.

Stat5 activity is regulated by the protein phosphatase SHP-1 in a phospholipase C (PLC)-beta3-dependent manner. Thus, PLC-beta3-deficient mice develop myeloproliferative neoplasm, like Lyn (Src family kinase)- deficient mice. Here we show that Lyn/PLC-beta3 doubly deficient lyn(-/-);PLC-beta3(-/-) mice develop a Stat5-dependent, fatal myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, similar to human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In hematopoietic stem cells of lyn(-/-);PLC-beta3(-/-) mice that cause the CMML-like disease, phosphorylation of SHP-1 at Tyr(536) and Tyr(564) is abrogated, resulting in reduced phosphatase activity and constitutive activation of Stat5. Furthermore, SHP-1 phosphorylation at Tyr(564) by Lyn is indispensable for maximal phosphatase activity and for suppression of the CMML-like disease in these mice. On the other hand, Tyr(536) in SHP-1 can be phosphorylated by Lyn and another kinase(s) and is necessary for efficient interaction with Stat5. Therefore, we identify a novel Lyn/PLC-beta3-mediated regulatory mechanism of SHP-1 and Stat5 activities.","['Xiao, Wenbin', 'Ando, Tomoaki', 'Wang, Huan-You', 'Kawakami, Yuko', 'Kawakami, Toshiaki']","['Xiao W', 'Ando T', 'Wang HY', 'Kawakami Y', 'Kawakami T']","['Division of Cell Biology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcb3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Inflammation/etiology/pathology', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phospholipase C beta/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism/*physiology']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60889-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-283937 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):6003-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-283937.

In addition to different clinical manifestations, different stages of ATL have different molecular signatures. Here, we demonstrated that smoldering/chronic ATL peripheral blood mononuclear cells spontaneously proliferated ex vivo in a cytokine (interleukin-12 [IL-12]/IL-9/IL-15)-dependent manner, while acute-type ATL peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not proliferate or proliferated independent of cytokines. Smoldering/chronic ATL cells produced IL-2 and IL-9 in 6-day ex vivo cultures. Interestingly, the addition of an anti-IL-2R-alpha monoclonal antibody profoundly inhibited IL-9 expression, suggesting optimal expression of IL-9 was dependent on IL-2 signaling in these patients. To determine whether there would be autonomous proliferation of ATL leukemic cells, we purified leukemic cells from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL. Purified leukemic cells cultured alone produced IL-2/IL-9, and the downstream Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway was activated. However, the leukemic cells did not proliferate independently, but required coculture with autologous monocytes to induce proliferation. Moreover, interaction between leukemic cells and monocytes was contact dependent, and major histocompatibility complex class II expression may have contributed to this interaction. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that there is autocrine/paracrine cytokine stimulation of leukemic cell proliferation in patients with smoldering/chronic ATL that could be targeted for treatment.","['Chen, Jing', 'Petrus, Mike', 'Bryant, Bonita R', 'Nguyen, Vinh Phuc', 'Goldman, Carolyn K', 'Bamford, Richard', 'Morris, John C', 'Janik, John E', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Chen J', 'Petrus M', 'Bryant BR', 'Nguyen VP', 'Goldman CK', 'Bamford R', 'Morris JC', 'Janik JE', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Paracrine Communication']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60883-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-277418 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):5948-56. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-277418.

To increase the potency of the antibody without the nonspecific cytotoxicity associated with beta-emitters, the alpha-particle-emitting radionuclide bismuth-213 ((213)Bi) was conjugated to lintuzumab. This phase I/II trial was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and antileukemic effects of (213)Bi-lintuzumab, the first targeted alpha-emitter, after partially cytoreductive chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-one patients with newly diagnosed (n = 13) or relapsed/refractory (n = 18) AML (median age, 67 years; range, 37-80) were treated with cytarabine (200 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 days followed by (213)Bi-lintuzumab (18.5-46.25 MBq/kg). RESULTS: The MTD of (213)Bi-lintuzumab was 37 MB/kg; myelosuppression lasting >35 days was dose limiting. Extramedullary toxicities were primarily limited to grade </=2 events, including infusion-related reactions. Transient grade 3/4 liver function abnormalities were seen in five patients (16%). Treatment-related deaths occurred in 2 of 21 (10%) patients who received the MTD. Significant reductions in marrow blasts were seen at all dose levels. The median response duration was 6 months (range, 2-12). Biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies suggested that saturation of available CD33 sites by (213)Bi-lintuzumab was achieved after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential administration of cytarabine and (213)Bi-lintuzumab is tolerable and can produce remissions in patients with AML.","['Rosenblat, Todd L', 'McDevitt, Michael R', 'Mulford, Deborah A', 'Pandit-Taskar, Neeta', 'Divgi, Chaitanya R', 'Panageas, Katherine S', 'Heaney, Mark L', 'Chanel, Suzanne', 'Morgenstern, Alfred', 'Sgouros, George', 'Larson, Steven M', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Jurcic, Joseph G']","['Rosenblat TL', 'McDevitt MR', 'Mulford DA', 'Pandit-Taskar N', 'Divgi CR', 'Panageas KS', 'Heaney ML', 'Chanel S', 'Morgenstern A', 'Sgouros G', 'Larson SM', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Jurcic JG']","['Department of Medicine and the Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alpha Particles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bismuth/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Radioisotopes/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0382 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0382 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 1;16(21):5303-11. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0382.

To assess the degree of familial aggregation of glioma, the authors performed a pooled analysis of data from 2 large glioma case-control studies in the United States (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (1994-2006) and University of California, San Francisco (1991-2004)) and from the Swedish Cancer Registry (1958-2006) to measure excess cases of cancer among first-degree relatives of glioma probands. This analysis included 20,377 probands with glioma and 52,714 first-degree relatives. No overall increase was found in the expected number of cancers among family members; however, there were 77% more gliomas than expected. There were also significantly more sarcoma and melanoma cases than expected, which is supported by evidence in the literature, whereas there were significantly fewer-than-expected cases of leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and bladder, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and uterine cancers. This large pooled analysis provided sufficient numbers of related family members to examine the genetic mechanisms involved in the aggregation of glioma with other cancers in these families.

Because this integrin plays a key role in angiogenesis and metastasis of human tumors, alphavbeta3 integrin ligands are of great interest to advances in targeted therapy and cancer imaging. In this report, one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial libraries containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif were designed and screened against K562 myeloid leukemia cells that had been transfected with the human alphavbeta3 integrin gene. Cyclic peptide LXW7 was identified as a leading ligand with a built-in handle that binds specifically to alphavbeta3 and showed comparable binding affinity (IC(50) = 0.68 +/- 0.08 mumol/L) to some of the well-known RGD ""head-to-tail"" cyclic pentapeptide ligands reported in the literature. The biotinylated form of LXW7 ligand showed similar binding strength as LXW7 against alphavbeta3 integrin, whereas biotinylated RGD cyclopentapeptide ligands revealed a 2- to 8-fold weaker binding affinity than their free forms. LXW7 was able to bind to both U-87MG glioblastoma and A375M melanoma cell lines, both of which express high levels of alphavbeta3 integrin. In vivo and ex vivo optical imaging studies with the biotinylated ligand/streptavidin-Cy5.5 complex in nude mice bearing U-87MG or A375M xenografts revealed preferential uptake of biotinylated LXW7 in tumor.

The effects of mda-7/IL-24 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have not been extensively characterized. Treatment with recombinant GST-MDA-7/IL-24 potently induced apoptosis in diverse myeloid leukemia cell types including U937, HL60, MV4-11, EOL-1, and MLL/ENL cells. MDA-7/IL-24 also markedly induced apoptosis in and suppressed the colony-forming capacity of primary AML blasts but exerted minimal toxicity toward normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. MDA-7/IL-24 lethality was associated with pronounced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction in leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts, manifested by the accumulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78)/BiP, inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation. It is noteworthy that short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of IRE1alpha, GADD34, or GRP78/BiP significantly enhanced MDA-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis, indicating a protective role for these molecules against MDA-7/IL-24 lethality. MDA-7/IL-24 also down-regulated the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and sharply increased expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bim and Noxa. Ectopic Mcl-1 expression or shRNA knockdown of Bim or Noxa significantly attenuated MDA-7/IL-24-mediated leukemia cell death. Finally, knockdown of Bax or Bak significantly reduced MDA-7/IL-24 lethality. Together, these findings indicate that MDA-7/IL-24 potently induces apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells through a process regulated by ER stress induction, Mcl-1 down-regulation, and Bim and Noxa up-regulation. They also suggest that MDA-7/IL-24 warrants further investigation in myeloid leukemia.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Mayo, Mandy', 'Dash, Rupesh', 'Sokhi, Upneet Kaur', 'Dmitriev, Igor P', 'Sarkar, Devanand', 'Dent, Paul', 'Curiel, David T', 'Fisher, Paul B', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Mayo M', 'Dash R', 'Sokhi UK', 'Dmitriev IP', 'Sarkar D', 'Dent P', 'Curiel DT', 'Fisher PB', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (interleukin-24)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*pathology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Stress, Physiological/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2010/09/23 06:00,2010/12/18 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.110.068007 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.110.068007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 Dec;78(6):1096-104. doi: 10.1124/mol.110.068007.

Treatment of ALL consists of chemotherapy for a period of 2 years. Bone marrow transplantation and radiotherapy are indicated in only very few patients. The most important chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of ALL are glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisone), vincristine, asparaginase, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. The cure rate of patients under the age of 18 years has increased from almost zero to > 80% in the past 40 years. Prognostically important factors are age at diagnosis, genetic abnormalities in the leukaemic cells and initial response to therapy. Adolescents with ALL have a much better prognosis when treated according to the protocol for children with ALL rather than the protocol for adults. It is anticipated that genomic research will lead to better classification and to more personalized therapy for individual patients.","['Pieters, Rob']",['Pieters R'],"['Erasmus MC-Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, afd.

20858288,NLM,MEDLINE,20110214,20211020,1423-0127 (Electronic) 1021-7770 (Linking),17,,2010 Sep 22,High cell density and latent membrane protein 1 expression induce cleavage of the mixed lineage leukemia gene at 11q23 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line.,77,10.1186/1423-0127-17-77 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is commonly found in Southern China and South East Asia. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is well associated with NPC and has been implicated in its pathogenesis. Moreover, various chromosome rearrangements were reported in NPC. However, the underlying mechanism of chromosome rearrangement remains unclear. Furthermore, the relationship between EBV and chromosome rearrangement with respect to the pathogenesis of NPC has not been established. We hypothesize that during virus- or stress-induced apoptosis, chromosomes are initially cleaved at the base of the chromatin loop domain structure. Upon DNA repair, cell may survive with rearranged chromosomes. METHODS: In this study, cells were seeded at various densities to induce apoptosis. Genomic DNA extracted was processed for Southern hybridization. In order to investigate the role of EBV, especially the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), LMP1 gene was overexpressed in NPC cells and chromosome breaks were analyzed by inverse polymerase chain (IPCR) reaction. RESULTS: Southern analysis revealed that high cell density resulted in cleavage of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). This high cell density-induced cleavage was significantly reduced by caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK. Similarly, IPCR analysis showed that LMP1 expression enhanced cleavage of the MLL bcr. Breakpoint analysis revealed that these breaks occurred within the matrix attachment region/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR). CONCLUSIONS: Since MLL locates at 11q23, a common deletion site in NPC, our results suggest a possibility of stress- or virus-induced apoptosis in the initiation of chromosome rearrangements at 11q23. The breakpoint analysis results also support the role of chromatin structure in defining the site of chromosome rearrangement.","['Yee, Peter Han-Chung', 'Sim, Sai-Peng']","['Yee PH', 'Sim SP']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Lot 77, Seksyen 22 KTLD, Jalan Tun Ahmad Zaidi Adruce, 93150 Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100922,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-17-77 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-17-77 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2010 Sep 22;17:77. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-17-77.,,PMC2954915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice carrying a null allele for the MMR gene Mlh1 are preferentially prone to the development of lymphomas of B- and T-cell origin and to a lesser extent gastrointestinal tumors. Consistent with these findings in mice, MMR defects have also been observed in sporadic and hereditary hematological malignancies. To study the role of MLH1 for lymphomagenesis in more detail, we generated a new mouse model carrying a conditional Mlh1 allele (Mlh1(flox/flox)). Mating of these mice with EIIa-Cre recombinase transgenic mice allowed the constitutive inactivation of MLH1, and the resulting Mlh1(Deltaex4/Deltaex4) mouse line displays complete MMR deficiency and a cancer predisposition phenotype similar to Mlh1-/- mice. For T-cell specific MMR inactivation we combined the Mlh1(flox/flox) allele with the Lck-Cre transgene. In the resulting Mlh1(TDeltaex4/TDeltaex4) mice, MLH1 inactivation is limited to DP/SP thymocytes and naive peripheral T-cells. The development of T-cell lymphomas in Mlh1(TDeltaex4/TDeltaex4) mice is significantly reduced compared to Mlh1-/- mice, implying that MMR functions either at very early stages during T-cell development or even earlier in lymphoid precursor cells to suppress lymphomagenesis.","['Reiss, Cora', 'Haneke, Torsten', 'Volker, Hans-Ulrich', 'Spahn, Martin', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Edelmann, Winfried', 'Kneitz, Burkhard']","['Reiss C', 'Haneke T', 'Volker HU', 'Spahn M', 'Rosenwald A', 'Edelmann W', 'Kneitz B']","['Physiological Chemistry I, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Mlh1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/pathology']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.510360 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Oct;51(10):1875-86. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.510360.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Oct;51(10):1777-8.

The release of NF-kappaB facilitates its translocation to the nucleus, where it promotes cell survival by initiating transcription of genes encoding stress-response enzymes, cell-adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-apoptotic proteins. NF-kappaB and associated regulatory factors (IkappaB kinase subunits and bcl-3) are implicated in hematological and solid tumour malignancies. NF-kappaB appears to be involved in cell proliferation control, apoptosis control, angiogenesis promotion and possibly regulation of diffusion of metastases. There are several reports that inhibition of NF-kappaB as a therapeutic target may have a role in tumour cell death or growth inhibition. AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: We review data about inhibition of NF-kappaB in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We describe the molecular mechanisms underlying NF-kappaB deregulation in these haematological malignancies. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in the nucleus has been reported in some varieties of MDS/AML. The in vitro and in vivo results of NF-kappaB inhibition in myeloid malignancies are highlighted. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: NF-kappaB selective inhibitory drugs may be useful, either as single agents or associated with conventional chemotherapy.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G']","['Sapienza University, Department of Human Biotechnologies and Hematology, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2010/09/23 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2010.522570 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2010 Nov;14(11):1157-76. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2010.522570.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2010 Nov;14(11):1139-42.

Cranial irradiation (CRT), is considered to be the primary risk factor for development of obesity. AIMS: The aim of our study was to evaluate body mass index (BMI) and serum leptin levels in survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: Subjects (Group I) consisted of 93 survivors of childhood ALL (53 males > or = 9 years old, 40 females > or = 8 years old) diagnosed between January 1975 and December 2002 in the Hematology-Oncology Division in Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University after a follow up 10.21 +/- 4.90 (mean +/- SD) years. Fifty healthy individuals of similar chronological age were taken as controls (29 males, 21 females). Seventy-four subjects had received radiotherapy (Group IA) and 19 had not (Group I B). RESULTS: In Group I, BMI was significantly higher than in Group II (21.65 +/- 4.02 vs 20.31 +/- 3.49, p = 0.04). However, BMI was significantly higher only in Group I A (21.83 +/- 4.27) than in Group II (p = 0.032). Leptin levels were significantly higher in Group I A females than in Group II females. There was a significant correlation between BMI-SDS and serum leptin levels in group IA females. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemia treatment leads to obesity. Higher leptin levels in girls may suggest that sex may be a differentiating factor for this late effect.","['Karaman, S', 'Ercan, O', 'Yildiz, I', 'Bolayirli, M', 'Celkan, T', 'Apak, H', 'Ozkan, A', 'Onal, H', 'Canbolat, A']","['Karaman S', 'Ercan O', 'Yildiz I', 'Bolayirli M', 'Celkan T', 'Apak H', 'Ozkan A', 'Onal H', 'Canbolat A']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, University of Istanbul , Istanbul, Turkey. drkaramans@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,['0 (Leptin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors']",2010/09/23 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/09/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/jpem.2010.23.7.669 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2010 Jul;23(7):669-74. doi: 10.1515/jpem.2010.23.7.669.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While GSTA1-1/A2-2 isozymes exhibit high activity towards lipid and fatty acid hydroperoxides through their selenium independent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, the GSTA4-4 isozyme efficiently metabolizes the LPO product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) by conjugating it with glutathione (GSH). Because of the fact that ROS generated by the chemopreventive agents, sulforaphane (SFN) and curcumin (Cur), are implicated in the mechanisms of cancer cell killing, the present studies were designed to investigate the contribution of ROS induced LPO in the cytotoxic effects of these agents and the role of alpha-class GSTs in modulating their toxicity. Human erythroleukemic (HL60) cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding the hGSTA1-1 and mGsta4-4 isozymes. After analysing the expression and activities of the respective GST isozymes, the effects of SFN and Cur on the extent of LPO, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were compared in empty vector (VT), hGSTA1-1 and mGsta4-4 expressing HL60 cells. These studies demonstrate that when compared with SFN, Cur was relatively more cytotoxic to HL60 cells. The ectopic expression of hGSTA1-1 and mGsta4-4 isozymes provided resistance to SFN and Cur induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis through a significant suppression of LPO in these cells. Overall, the results suggest that the expression of alpha-class GSTs in cancer cells can modulate the therapeutic efficacy of chemopreventive agents.","['Sharma, Rajendra', 'Ellis, Bryan', 'Sharma, Abha']","['Sharma R', 'Ellis B', 'Sharma A']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.

In recent years, prognostic/predictive markers such as ER/PR or HER2/neu have been widely used in the selection of the optimal breast cancer treatments for individual patients, which have been proven to be very effective in disease control.

Despite these improvements, we still need novel and less toxic treatment strategies targeting aberrantly activated signaling networks which increase proliferation, survival, and drug resistance of T-ALL cells. One such network is represented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt axis. PI3K inhibitors have displayed some promising effects in preclinical models of T-ALL. Here, we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the Akt inhibitor, triciribine, in T-ALL cell lines. Triciribine caused cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Western blots demonstrated a dose-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt1/Akt2, and of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 downstream targets in response to triciribine. Triciribine induced autophagy, which could be interpreted as a defensive mechanism, because an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) increased triciribine-induced apoptosis. Triciribine synergized with vincristine, a chemotherapeutic drug employed for treating T-ALL patients, and targeted the side population of T-ALL cell lines, which might correspond to leukemia initiating cells. Our findings indicate that Akt inhibition, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, may serve as an efficient treatment towards T-ALL cells requiring upregulation of this signaling pathway for their proliferation and survival.","['Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Tazzari, Pierluigi', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Battistelli, Michela', 'Falcieri, Elisabetta', 'Ognibene, Andrea', 'Pagliaro, Pasqualepaolo', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Ricci F', 'Tazzari P', 'Chiarini F', 'Battistelli M', 'Falcieri E', 'Ognibene A', 'Pagliaro P', 'Cocco L', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Cell Signalling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CRTC2 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '2421HMY9N6 (triciribine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Side-Population Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/01/29 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Mar;226(3):822-31. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22407.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma comprised of 32 cases (76.2% of all lymphomas), Hodgkin lymphoma-10 cases and the rest were metastatic carcinoma. The diagnostic accuracy for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma was 93.3%, sensitivity 95.4%, and specificity 87.5%. FNAC is a rapid, safe, easy, and nonexpensive diagnostic technique which can be used for early diagnosis of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.","['Alam, Kiran', 'Jain, Anshu', 'Maheshwari, Veena', 'Siddiqui, Farhan Asif', 'Haider, Nazima', 'Khan, Arshad Hafiz']","['Alam K', 'Jain A', 'Maheshwari V', 'Siddiqui FA', 'Haider N', 'Khan AH']","['Department of Pathology, JN Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100920,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/09/13 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dc.21447 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2011 Jun;39(6):461-7. doi: 10.1002/dc.21447.

Following reduction of high tumour burden by effective cytotoxic agents, two major immune-stimulating approaches are being pursued. First, innate immunity can be activated by monoclonal antibodies triggering antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Second, tumour-specific T cell responses can be generated by immunization of patients with peptides derived from tumour antigens and infused in soluble form or loaded onto dendritic cells. The choice of cytotoxic agents for such combinatory regimens is crucial since most substances such as fludarabine are considered immunosuppressive while others such as cyclophosphamide can have immunostimulatory activity. We tested in this study whether fludarabine and/or cyclophosphamide, which represent a very effective treatment regimen for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, would interfere with a therapeutic strategy of T cell activation. Analysis of peripheral blood samples from patients prior and during fludarabine/cyclophosphamide therapy revealed rapid and sustained reduction of tumour cells but also of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This correlated with a significant cytotoxic activity of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide on T cells in vitro. Unexpectedly, T cells surviving fludarabine/cyclophosphamide treatment in vitro had a more mature phenotype, while fludarabine-treated T cells were significantly more responsive to mitogenic stimulation than their untreated counterparts and showed a shift towards T(H)1 cytokine secretion. In conclusion, fludarabine/cyclophosphamide therapy though inducing significant and relevant T cell depletion seems to generate a micromilieu suitable for subsequent T cell activation.","['Gassner, Franz Josef', 'Weiss, Lukas', 'Geisberger, Roland', 'Hofbauer, Josefina Pinon', 'Egle, Alexander', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Greil, Richard', 'Tinhofer, Inge']","['Gassner FJ', 'Weiss L', 'Geisberger R', 'Hofbauer JP', 'Egle A', 'Hartmann TN', 'Greil R', 'Tinhofer I']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research (LIMCR), 3rd Medical Department with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Muellner Hauptstrasse 48, 5020, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0920-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Jan;60(1):75-85. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0920-3.

As most of these patients will not have an MSD, the decision to pursue an unrelated allo-HCT in second remission (CR2) or await a future relapse and perform HCT in third remission (CR3) continues to be debated. Between 1990 and 2006, 41 children with relapsed B-precursor ALL received a myeloablative allo-HCT at the University of Minnesota. Graft sources consisted of matched related donor (n=11), matched unrelated donor (n=9), and unrelated umbilical cord blood (n=21). Before allo-HCT, 15 patients had an early relapse (<36 months from diagnosis) and 26 had an initial late relapse (>/=36 months from diagnosis). In all, 30 patients (73%) were in CR2 and 11 were in CR3 (27%) at time of allo-HCT. Five year OS/DFS were similar for patients with an early or late marrow relapse, but there was inferior DFS among late-relapse patients transplanted in CR3 compared with CR2 (30% vs 75%, P=0.04). These results suggest that allo-HCT should be pursued in children after a first marrow relapse, rather than waiting for subsequent recurrence.","['Beck, J C', 'Cao, Q', 'Trotz, B', 'Smith, A R', 'Weigel, B J', 'Verneris, M R', 'Burke, M J']","['Beck JC', 'Cao Q', 'Trotz B', 'Smith AR', 'Weigel BJ', 'Verneris MR', 'Burke MJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2010217 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2010.217 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jul;46(7):950-5. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2010.217.

Treatment of breast cancer cells with CDK inhibitors (flavopiridol; roscovitine) enhanced the lethality of the ERBB1 inhibitor lapatinib in a synergistic fashion. CDK inhibitors interacted with lapatinib to reduce MCL-1 expression and over-expression of MCL-1 or knock down of BAX and BAK suppressed drug combination lethality. Lapatinib-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 and to a lesser extent AKT facilitated CDK inhibitor -induced suppression of MCL-1 levels. Treatment of cells with the BH3 domain / MCL-1 inhibitor obatoclax enhanced the lethality of lapatinib in a synergistic fashion. Knock out of MCL-1 and BCL-XL enhanced lapatinib toxicity to a similar extent as obatoclax and suppressed the ability of obatoclax to promote lapatinib lethality. Pre-treatment of cells with lapatinib or with obatoclax enhanced basal levels of BAX and BAK activity and further enhanced drug combination toxicity. In vivo tumor growth data in xenograft and syngeneic model systems confirmed our in vitro findings. Treatment of cells with CDK inhibitors enhanced the lethality of obatoclax in a synergistic fashion. Over-expression of MCL-1 or knock down of BAX and BAK suppressed the toxic interaction between CDK inhibitors and obatoclax. Obatoclax and lapatinib treatment or obatoclax and CDK inhibitor treatment or lapatinib and CDK inhibitor treatment radiosensitized breast cancer cells. Lapatinib and obatoclax interacted to suppress mammary tumor growth in vivo. Collectively our data demonstrate that manipulation of MCL-1 protein expression by CDK inhibition or inhibition of sequestering function MCL-1 by Obatoclax renders breast cancer cells more susceptible to BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and tumor cell death.","['Mitchell, Clint', 'Yacoub, Adly', 'Hossein, Hamed', 'Martin, Aditi Pandya', 'Bareford, M Danielle', 'Eulitt, Patrick', 'Yang, Chen', 'Nephew, Kenneth P', 'Dent, Paul']","['Mitchell C', 'Yacoub A', 'Hossein H', 'Martin AP', 'Bareford MD', 'Eulitt P', 'Yang C', 'Nephew KP', 'Dent P']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101101,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Lapatinib', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['13273 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.10.9.13273 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Nov 1;10(9):903-17. doi: 10.4161/cbt.10.9.13273.

Vaccination with hematopoiesis-restricted mHag peptides, such as HA-1, may boost the graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, some animal studies indicate that peptides exactly reflecting immunogenic T cell epitopes (short peptides [SPs]) induce tolerance that is potentially due to systemic Ag spreading. Peptide length extension (long peptides [LPs]) may optimize immune responses by restricting and prolonging Ag presentation on dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we compared the in vitro characteristics and T cell-stimulatory capacities of a human 30-mer HA-1 LP with the 9-mer HA-1 SP. DCs presented the HA-1 LP and SP and expanded HA-1-specific cytotoxic T cell lines. As hypothesized, HA-1 LP presentation, but not SP presentation, was largely restricted to activated DCs and was nearly absent on other hematopoietic cells. However, DCs presented the HA-1 LP 2-3 log levels less efficiently than the SP. Finally, the decay of HA-1 LP and SP presentation on DCs was comparable. We conclude that HA-1 LP and SP differ in their in vitro characteristics and that only comparative clinical studies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation may reveal the optimal HA-1 vaccine.","['Hambach, Lothar', 'Aghai, Zohara', 'Pool, Jos', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Hambach L', 'Aghai Z', 'Pool J', 'Kroger N', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. l.w.h.hambach@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/*immunology', 'Peptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000213 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000213 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Oct 15;185(8):4582-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000213.

The ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) locus encodes a DNA binding zinc-finger transcription factor that is aberrantly expressed in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with poor outcome. We find that the promoter DNA methylation signature of EVI1 AML blast cells differs from those of normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells and other AMLs. This signature contained 294 differentially methylated genes, of which 238 (81%) were coordinately hypermethylated. An unbiased motif analysis revealed an overrepresentation of EVI1 binding sites among these aberrantly hypermethylated loci. EVI1 was capable of binding to these promoters in 2 different EVI1-expressing cell lines, whereas no binding was observed in an EVI1-negative cell line. Furthermore, EVI1 was observed to interact with DNA methyl transferases 3A and 3B. Among the EVI1 AML cases, 2 subgroups were recognized, of which 1 contained AMLs with many more methylated genes, which was associated with significantly higher levels of EVI1 than in the cases of the other subgroup. Our data point to a role for EVI1 in directing aberrant promoter DNA methylation patterning in EVI1 AMLs.","['Lugthart, Sanne', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Bindels, Eric', 'Skrabanek, Lucy', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Li, Yushan', 'Meyer, Stefan', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren, Claudia', 'Greally, John', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Lugthart S', 'Figueroa ME', 'Bindels E', 'Skrabanek L', 'Valk PJ', 'Li Y', 'Meyer S', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren C', 'Greally J', 'Lowenberg B', 'Melnick A', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60159-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-281337 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Jan 6;117(1):234-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-281337.

Advanced SM may present as smoldering or slowly progressing neoplasm but may also present as rapidly progressing aggressive SM or even as MC leukemia. Approximately half of the patients have an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) or develop an AHNMD over time. Drug resistance may not only result from the KIT mutant D816V that is found in most patients, but also from KIT-independent pro-oncogenic signaling pathways that play a role in disease evolution. In patients with slow progression, advanced SM can often be kept under control for months with interferon-alpha or 2CdA. By contrast, in rapidly progressing aggressive SM and MC leukemia, even polychemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may fail, which points to the need to develop new drugs and treatment concepts for these patients. In SM-AHNMD, separate treatment plans should be established for the SM component and the AHNMD component of the disease, with recognition that the AHNMD often has to be managed and treated as a secondary and thus a high-risk neoplasm.","['Valent, Peter', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Akin, Cem']","['Valent P', 'Sperr WR', 'Akin C']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34783-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-292144 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):5812-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-292144.

The 8 patients (10.7%) who expressed EVI-1 transcripts detectable by real-time polymerase chain reaction had significantly lower event-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival than patients with undetectable transcript. The predictive value of EVI-1 expression was validated in an independent cohort.

It is interesting that platelet activation markers were associated with DIC severity and erroneous platelet counting, suggesting that platelet activation is a potential source of inaccuracy. Furthermore, the artifactual in vitro platelet activation induced a high degree of intermethod variation in platelet counts.

How the marks facilitate cell cycle-dependent gene expression is poorly understood. The evolutionarily conserved AAA ATPase ANCCA (AAA nuclear coregulator cancer-associated protein)/ATAD2 was identified as a direct target of oncogene AIB1/ACTR/SRC-3 and a transcriptional coregulator for estrogen and androgen receptors and is strongly implicated in tumorigenesis. We report here that ANCCA directly interacts with E2F1 to E2F3 and that its N terminus interacts with both the N and C termini of E2F1. ANCCA preferentially associates via its bromodomain with H3 acetylated at lysine 14 (H3K14ac) and is required for key cell cycle gene expression and cancer cell proliferation. ANCCA associates with chromosomes at late mitosis, and its occupancy at E2F targets peaks at the G(1)-to-S transition. Strikingly, ANCCA is required for recruitment of specific E2Fs to their targets and chromatin assembly of the host cell factor 1 (HCF-1)-MLL histone methyltransferase complex. ANCCA depletion results in a marked decrease of the gene activation-linked H3K4me3 mark. Bromodomain mutations disable ANCCA function as an E2F coactivator and its ability to promote cancer cell proliferation, while ANCCA overexpression in tumors correlates with tumor growth. Together, these results suggest that ANCCA acts as a pioneer factor in E2F-dependent gene activation and that a novel mechanism involving ANCCA bromodomain may contribute to cancer cell proliferation.","['Revenko, Alexey S', 'Kalashnikova, Ekaterina V', 'Gemo, Abigael T', 'Zou, June X', 'Chen, Hong-Wu']","['Revenko AS', 'Kalashnikova EV', 'Gemo AT', 'Zou JX', 'Chen HW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100920,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (ATAD2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'E2F Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00484-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00484-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Nov;30(22):5260-72. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00484-10.

TAL1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that can interfere with the transcriptional activity of E2A and HEB during T cell leukemogenesis; however, the oncogenic pathways directly activated by TAL1 are not characterized. In this study, we show that, in human TAL1-expressing T-ALL cell lines, TAL1 directly activates NKX3.1, a tumor suppressor gene required for prostate stem cell maintenance. In human T-ALL cell lines, NKX3.1 gene activation is mediated by a TAL1-LMO-Ldb1 complex that is recruited by GATA-3 bound to an NKX3.1 gene promoter regulatory sequence. TAL1-induced NKX3.1 activation is associated with suppression of HP1-alpha (heterochromatin protein 1 alpha) binding and opening of chromatin on the NKX3.1 gene promoter. NKX3.1 is necessary for T-ALL proliferation, can partially restore proliferation in TAL1 knockdown cells, and directly regulates miR-17-92. In primary human TAL1-expressing leukemic cells, the NKX3.1 gene is expressed independently of the Notch pathway, and its inactivation impairs proliferation. Finally, TAL1 or NKX3.1 knockdown abrogates the ability of human T-ALL cells to efficiently induce leukemia development in mice. These results suggest that tumor suppressor or oncogenic activity of NKX3.1 depends on tissue expression.","['Kusy, Sophie', 'Gerby, Bastien', 'Goardon, Nicolas', 'Gault, Nathalie', 'Ferri, Federica', 'Gerard, Delphine', 'Armstrong, Florence', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri']","['Kusy S', 'Gerby B', 'Goardon N', 'Gault N', 'Ferri F', 'Gerard D', 'Armstrong F', 'Ballerini P', 'Cayuela JM', 'Baruchel A', 'Pflumio F', 'Romeo PH']","[""Laboratoire de recherche sur la Reparation et la Transcription dans les cellules Souches, Direction des Sciences du Vivant, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, 92265 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100920,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (NKX3-1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Male', 'Metalloproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostate/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20100745 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20100745 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2010 Sep 27;207(10):2141-56. doi: 10.1084/jem.20100745.

Association analysis showed that thiopurine S-methyltransferase, ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E), and multidrug resistance protein 4 (ABCC4) expression were correlated with thiopurine cytotoxicity. Those observations suggested the possible existence of a ""thiopurine cellular circulation"" involving nucleotide efflux by ABCC4, hydrolysis of thiopurine nucleotide monophosphates outside of the cell by NT5E, and subsequent transport of thiopurine nucleosides back into the cell by nucleoside transporters. The existence of this cellular circulation was confirmed by a series of functional experiments performed with cultured cells stably or transiently transfected with ABCC4 and/or NT5E. Because of the central role of NT5E in this cellular circulation, the NT5E gene was resequenced using 287 DNA samples from three ethnic groups, with the identification of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 46 of which were novel.

This has led to the suggestion that iron overload is common and deleterious in this patient population. However, the relationship between serum ferritin and parenchymal iron overload in such patients is unknown. We report a prospective study of 48 patients with acute leukemia (AL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) undergoing myeloablative HSCT, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate liver iron content (LIC) and cardiac iron. The median (and range) pre-HSCT value of serum ferritin was 1549 ng/mL (20-6989); serum hepcidin, 59 ng/mL (10-468); labile plasma iron, 0 LPI units (0.0-0.9). Eighty-five percent of patients had hepatic iron overload (HIO), and 42% had significant HIO (LIC >/=5.0 mg/gdw). Only 1 patient had cardiac iron overload. There was a strong correlation between pre-HSCT serum ferritin and estimated LIC (r = .75), which was mostly dependent on prior transfusion history. Serum hepcidin was appropriately elevated in patients with HIO. Labile plasma iron elevation was rare. A regression calibration analysis supported the hypothesis that elevated pre-HSCT LIC is significantly associated with inferior post-HSCT survival. These results contribute to our understanding of the prevalence, mechanism, and consequences of iron overload in HSCT.","['Armand, Philippe', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Rhodes, Joanna', 'Sainvil, Marie-Michele', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Koreth, John', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Hearsey, Doreen', 'Neufeld, Ellis J', 'Fleming, Mark D', 'Steen, Hanno', 'Anderson, Damon', 'Kwong, Raymond Y', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Antin, Joseph H']","['Armand P', 'Kim HT', 'Rhodes J', 'Sainvil MM', 'Cutler C', 'Ho VT', 'Koreth J', 'Alyea EP', 'Hearsey D', 'Neufeld EJ', 'Fleming MD', 'Steen H', 'Anderson D', 'Kwong RY', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Antin JH']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. parmand@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100918,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (HAMP protein, human)', '0 (Hepcidins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/blood', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepcidins', 'Humans', 'Iron/*analysis', 'Iron Overload/*blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Liver/chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00386-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jun;17(6):852-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.09.006.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The transforming domain of one of the most common MLL fusion partners, AF9, was immunopurified after expression in myeloblastic M1 cells, and associating proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine how binding of associating proteins compare across Hoxa9 and Meis1 in cell lines with and without MLL fusion proteins and how binding is altered during gene down-regulation and differentiation. RESULTS: Consistent with earlier purifications of ENL and AF4 from 293 cells, the 90 amino acid C-terminal domain of AF9 associates with many other MLL translocation partners including Enl, Af4, Laf4, Af5q31, Ell, and Af10. This complex, termed elongation assisting proteins (EAPs), also contains the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase Cdk9/Cyclin T1/T2 (pTEFb) and the histone H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase Dot1L. Myeloid cells transformed by MLL fusions show higher levels and a broader distribution of EAP components at genes critical for leukemia. Inhibition of EAP components pTEFb and Dot1l show that both contribute significantly to activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 expression. EAP is dynamically associated with the Hoxa9 and Meis1 loci in hematopoietic cells and rapidly dissociates during induction of differentiation.

T-cell responses against BCR-ABL and other antigens are well-described, but their relevance to the in vivo control of CML is unclear. The suppressive role of naturally occurring T regulatory (T-reg) cells in antitumor immunity is well-established, although little is known about their role in modulating the T-cell response to BCR-ABL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Naturally occurring T-reg cells were characterized and quantified by flow cytometry in 39 CML patients and 10 healthy donors. Their function was studied by observing their effect on responses to purified protein derivative, a recall antigen, and on the response of an autologous T-cell line recognizing BCR-ABL. RESULTS: T-reg cells were CD4(+), CD25(+), FOXP3(+), CD127(low), and CD62L(high). T-reg numbers in patients in complete cytogenetic remission were significantly lower than in patients not in complete cytogenetic remission (p < 0.01). T-reg cell depletion using anti-CD25 selection enhanced proliferative responses to purified protein derivative. Furthermore, the interferon-gamma and/or granzyme-B production of effector cells specific for viral peptides or a BCR-ABL HLA-A3-restricted peptide was inhibited when autologous T-reg cells were present. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest a role for T-reg cells in limiting immune responses in CML patients and this may include immune responses to BCR-ABL. The increased frequency of T-reg cells in patients with high levels of BCR-ABL transcripts indicates that an immune mechanism may be important in the control of CML.","['Rojas, Jose M', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Owen, Sally', 'Knight, Katy', 'Watmough, Sarah J', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Rojas JM', 'Wang L', 'Owen S', 'Knight K', 'Watmough SJ', 'Clark RE']","['Department of Haematology, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100918,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",2010/09/22 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00413-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Dec;38(12):1209-18. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.09.004.

Six fused-pyrimidine ribonucleosides and one 2'-deoxynucleoside were assessed for their abilities to inhibit [(3)H]uridine transport in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing recombinant hCNT1, hCNT2 or hCNT3. Six of the analogs inhibited hCNT1 with K(i) values<1muM whereas only two analogs inhibited hCNT3 with K(i) values<1muM and none inhibited hCNT2. To assess if the inhibitory analogs were also permeants, currents evoked were measured in oocytes of Xenopus laevis producing recombinant hCNT1, hCNT2 or hCNT3. Significant inward currents, indicating permeant activity, were generated with (i) three of the analogs in hCNT1-producing oocytes, (ii) none of the analogs in hCNT2-producing oocytes and (iii) all of the analogs in hCNT3-producing oocytes. Four were not, or were only very weakly, transported by hCNT1. The thienopyrimidine 2'-deoxynucleoside (dMeThPmR, 3) and ribonucleoside (MeThPmR, 4) were the most active inhibitors of uridine transport in hCNT1-producing oocytes and were an order of magnitude more effective than adenosine, a known low-capacity transport inhibitor of hCNT1. Neither was toxic to cultured human leukemic CEM cells, and both protected CEM cell lines with hCNT1 but not with hENT1 against gemcitabine cytotoxicity. In summary, dMeThPmR (3) and MeThPmR (4) were potent inhibitors of hCNT1 with negligible transportability and little apparent cytotoxicity, suggesting that pending further evaluation for toxicity against normal cells, they may have utility in protecting normal hCNT1-producing tissues from toxicities resulting from anti-cancer nucleoside drugs that enter via hCNT1.","['Damaraju, Vijaya L', 'Smith, Kyla M', 'Mowles, Delores', 'Nowak, Ireneusz', 'Karpinski, Edward', 'Young, James D', 'Robins, Morris J', 'Cass, Carol E']","['Damaraju VL', 'Smith KM', 'Mowles D', 'Nowak I', 'Karpinski E', 'Young JD', 'Robins MJ', 'Cass CE']","['Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G1Z2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100918,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oocytes', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Xenopus laevis']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00692-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Jan 1;81(1):82-90. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.09.009.

While an important human pathogen, the details regarding virus replication cycle, including the nature of HTLV-1 particles, remain largely unknown due to the difficulties in propagating the virus in tissue culture. In this study, we created a codon-optimized HTLV-1 Gag fused to an EYFP reporter as a model system to quantitatively analyze HTLV-1 particles released from producer cells. RESULTS: The codon-optimized Gag led to a dramatic and highly robust level of Gag expression as well as virus-like particle (VLP) production. The robust level of particle production overcomes previous technical difficulties with authentic particles and allowed for detailed analysis of particle architecture using two novel methodologies. We quantitatively measured the diameter and morphology of HTLV-1 VLPs in their native, hydrated state using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Furthermore, we were able to determine HTLV-1 Gag stoichiometry as well as particle size with the novel biophysical technique of fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS). The average HTLV-1 particle diameter determined by cryo-TEM and FFS was 71 +/- 20 nm and 75 +/- 4 nm, respectively. These values are significantly smaller than previous estimates made of HTLV-1 particles by negative staining TEM. Furthermore, cryo-TEM reveals that the majority of HTLV-1 VLPs lacks an ordered structure of the Gag lattice, suggesting that the HTLV-1 Gag shell is very likely to be organized differently compared to that observed with HIV-1 Gag in immature particles. This conclusion is supported by our observation that the average copy number of HTLV-1 Gag per particle is estimated to be 510 based on FFS, which is significantly lower than that found for HIV-1 immature virions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our studies represent the first quantitative biophysical analysis of HTLV-1-like particles and reveal novel insights into particle morphology and Gag stochiometry.","['Grigsby, Iwen F', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Johnson, Jolene L', 'Fogarty, Keir H', 'Chen, Yan', 'Rawson, Jonathan M', 'Crosby, Aaron J', 'Mueller, Joachim D', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Grigsby IF', 'Zhang W', 'Johnson JL', 'Fogarty KH', 'Chen Y', 'Rawson JM', 'Crosby AJ', 'Mueller JD', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100920,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Codon/genetics', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Gene Products, gag/*analysis/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/*growth & development/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Spectrum Analysis/methods', 'Virion/*ultrastructure']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-75 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-75 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Sep 20;7:75. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-75.,"['T32 CA009138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21AI81673/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064589/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM064589/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DE07288/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI083196/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2954917,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients, including 64 with various types of AL, 31 with AA, and 9 with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). A group affiliation and an erythrocyte phenotype were determined from rhesus system antigens in all the patients and the HFE gene was studied to identify mutations. For control of siderosis, the authors determined serum iron (SI) by a colorimetric technique, by applying the kits of the AGAT firm (Russia), serum ferritin (SF) by an immunoradiometric method, by using the kits of Immunotech (Czechia). The volume of transfusion was estimated in the period of June 2007 to November 2009. RESULTS: There is evidence for a relationship between the higher level of SF and the number of transfusions. SF was 1046.1 microg/l in patients, H63D heterozygous carriers who had received less than 10 packed red blood cell transfusions and 2856 microg/l in those who had 20 transfusions (p < 0.005). HFE gene mutation carriage accelerates iron accumulation and is an additional risk factor for siderosis. In patients with transfusion chimeras and a rare phenotype in terms of rhesus antigens, packed red blood cell transfusion results in a much more increase in iron stores.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 9 patients with recurrent APL. The recurrences developed significantly more frequently in a very high-risk group (patients with minimal residual disease being preserved after the intensive therapy phase). Induction used arsenic trioxide (ATO) and/or standard chemotherapy + ATRA; ATO monotherapy was in consolidation. CD34+ cells were mobilized until molecular remission was achieved with high-dose Ara-C and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Pretransplantation conditioning involved melfalan as a basic drug in combination with high-dose AraC (5 pts), treosulfan (1 pt) or bisulfan (1 pt). Six patients received gemtusumab ozogamicin, 3-9 mg/m2, at different stages of therapy. RESULTS: Before therapy one patient died; 8 patients achieved the second molecular remission; CD34+ cell mobilization and sampling were effective in 7 cases. Five patients were in long-term molecular remission after autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT). Follow-up was 23-40 months. One patient is being prepared for transplantation. Following autoHSCT, another patient with a developed repeat recurrence died from complications due to related partially compatible transplantation. Visceral, including cardiological, toxicity of therapy was insignificant. In the APL-2003 protocol, overall and event-free survival rates were 93 +/- 3 and 76 +/- 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION; The application of ATO and autoHSCT in recurrent APL makes it possible to achieve and preserve the second molecular remission in case of insignificant extrahematological toxicity. Russian clinics should have access to ATO.","[""Baidil'dina, D D"", 'Maschan, M A', 'Skorobogatova, E V', 'Dubrovina, M E', 'Rumiantseva, Iu V', 'Maschan, A A', 'Rumiantsev, A G', 'Samochatova, E V']","[""Baidil'dina DD"", 'Maschan MA', 'Skorobogatova EV', 'Dubrovina ME', 'Rumiantseva IuV', 'Maschan AA', 'Rumiantsev AG', 'Samochatova EV']",,['rus'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*prevention & control/surgery', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2010;82(7):20-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 1873 primary patients with ALL aged 1 to 18 years, of whom 1544 patients were enrolled in this study, were notified at 36 clinics of Russia and Belarus from April 15, 2002, to January 1, 2008. RESULTS: With the median observation of 4.12 years, 7-year event-free survival (EFS) was 73 +/- 13%; overall survival (OS) 78 +/- 2%; relapse-free survival 82 +/- 1%. The rates of EFS and OS were equal and amounted to 76 +/- 2 and 80 +/- 2% in the standard-risk group (SRG) and intermediate-risk group (ImRG), respectively. In the high-risk group (HRG) patients, EFS and OS were as high as 30 +/- 6 and 37 +/- 6%, respectively. The frequency of relapses with central nervous system lesion was as much as 4.7% in all the patients, 6-year cumulative risk for isolated neurorecurrences being 2.5% in the SRG patients.

A poor early response to therapy (on induction days 8 and 15) was also associated with its lower efficiency. CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable rise in the number of centers and a slight increase in the intensity of therapy, the results of the new ALL-MB-2002 protocol are as minimum equivalents obtained in the use of the previous ALL-MB-91 protocol. A significant improvement in the overall results of therapy and a reduction in the cumulative risk for isolated neurorecurrences were noted in the ImRG patients.","['Rumiantseva, Iu V', 'Karachunskii, A I', 'Aleinikova, O V', 'Fechina, L G', 'Shamardina, A V', 'Litvinov, D V', 'Ponomareva, N I', 'Boichenko, E G', 'Dudkin, S A', 'Streneva, O V', 'Kondratchik, K L', 'Mansurova, E G', 'Minkina, L M', 'Lapotentova, E S', 'Iniushkina, E V', 'Iudina, N B', 'Pavlova, G P', 'Zhukovskaia, E V', 'Khlebnikova, O P', 'Lagoiko, S N', 'Basharova, E V', 'Denisov, R E', 'Zlobina, V D', 'Banshchikova, E S', 'Aslanian, K S', 'Kondakova, E V', 'Tselousova, E V', 'Miakova, N V', 'Turobova, T V', ""Ryskal', O V"", 'Chipsanova, N F', 'Varfolomeeva, S R', 'Rumiantsev, A G']","['Rumiantseva IuV', 'Karachunskii AI', 'Aleinikova OV', 'Fechina LG', 'Shamardina AV', 'Litvinov DV', 'Ponomareva NI', 'Boichenko EG', 'Dudkin SA', 'Streneva OV', 'Kondratchik KL', 'Mansurova EG', 'Minkina LM', 'Lapotentova ES', 'Iniushkina EV', 'Iudina NB', 'Pavlova GP', 'Zhukovskaia EV', 'Khlebnikova OP', 'Lagoiko SN', 'Basharova EV', 'Denisov RE', 'Zlobina VD', 'Banshchikova ES', 'Aslanian KS', 'Kondakova EV', 'Tselousova EV', 'Miakova NV', 'Turobova TV', ""Ryskal' OV"", 'Chipsanova NF', 'Varfolomeeva SR', 'Rumiantsev AG']",,['rus'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/prevention & control', 'Recurrence', 'Russia']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2010;82(7):11-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The information obtained in 4 Russian multicenter studies conducted in 33 hematology departments of 26 cities and towns of the Russian Federation in 1992 to 2009 was analyzed. Randomization was made in 243 patients with AML (median age 38 years) in 1992-1995, 396 patients (median age 39 years) in 1995-1999, 392 patients (median age 39 years) in 2001-2006, and 137 patients (median age 40 years) in 2006-2009. The analysis excluded patients with acute promyelocytic leukemias who were recruited in the AML-92 and AML-95 studies. These patients' statutory forms adequately filled in were 60-70% therefore toxicity was analyzed on the basis of the data of 631 patients. RESULTS: The baseline clinical and laboratory parameters in the patients enrolled in the studies in different years slightly differ in the count of leukocytes at the onset of the disease and in the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): the recent studies revealed a larger number of high-risk group patients (leukocytes more than 30 10(9)(/l; LDH more than 500 units) possibly due to the later diagnosis of AML. During the studies, the number of complete remissions remained as before (55%) after the first course and increased from 65 to 78% after the second course using cytosine arabinoside in high doses. Despite treatment intensification, mortality in the induction period remained as before (19-21%). Remission mortality decreased from 18 to 10-13%. The long-term results of using the aggressive therapy did not differ from those obtained during the standard treatment protocols. The duration of leucopenia after standard induction courses during the all studies remained equal (17-19 days); the exclusion was a HAM course as the second induction course after which the duration of neutropenia was much more than that of the standard course (17 and 10 days, respectively). During the study years, there was an increase in platelet transfusion volumes (from 20 to 53 doses during the first course and from 7 to 28 doses during the second course) and a reduction in the percentage of severe hemorrhagic complications. The incidence of pneumonias remained at the same level (40-50%) during the induction courses and that of septic complications and necrotic enteropathy considerably decreased from 40-46 to 17-19%. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis during the current programs from AML treatment was 10% (two induction courses), that of invasive candidiasis was 4.7% (two induction courses). CONCLUSION; The long-term results of treatment for AML were virtually unchanged regardless significant therapy intensification. Mortality remained high during induction treatment and in the postremission period. Its cause is severe infectious complications developing during myelotoxic agranulocytosis. The results of the analysis provide the basis for developing a new AML treatment protocol that should take into account all the merits and demerits of the previous protocols and provide a toxicity-treatment efficiency balance.","['Parovichnikova, E N', 'Savchenko, V G', 'Kliasova, G A', 'Isaev, V G', 'Sokolov, A N', 'Kulikov, S M', 'Ustinova, E N', 'Gribanova, E O', 'Ryzhko, V V', 'Khoroshko, N D', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Galstian, G M', 'Konstantinova, T S', 'Zagoskina, T P', 'Ziuzgin, I S', 'Kaplanov, K D', 'Moskov, V I', 'Sokolova, I V', 'Anchukova, L V', 'Lapin, V A', 'Loginov, A B', 'Tumakov, V A', 'Korobkin, A V', 'Miliutina, G I', 'Samoilova, O S', 'Tikunova, T S', 'Pristupa, A S', 'Kondakova, E V', 'Domnikova, N P', 'Gavrilova, L V', 'Obidina, N A', 'Porokhina, O V', 'Rekhtman, G B', 'Mashchuk, V N', 'Khuazheva, N K', 'Kaporskaia, T S', 'Golubeva, M E', 'Maksimov, A G', 'Ploskikh, M A', ""Men'shakova, S N"", ""Mal'tsev, V I"", 'Rossiev, V A', 'Pilipenko, G I']","['Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG', 'Kliasova GA', 'Isaev VG', 'Sokolov AN', 'Kulikov SM', 'Ustinova EN', 'Gribanova EO', 'Ryzhko VV', 'Khoroshko ND', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Galstian GM', 'Konstantinova TS', 'Zagoskina TP', 'Ziuzgin IS', 'Kaplanov KD', 'Moskov VI', 'Sokolova IV', 'Anchukova LV', 'Lapin VA', 'Loginov AB', 'Tumakov VA', 'Korobkin AV', 'Miliutina GI', 'Samoilova OS', 'Tikunova TS', 'Pristupa AS', 'Kondakova EV', 'Domnikova NP', 'Gavrilova LV', 'Obidina NA', 'Porokhina OV', 'Rekhtman GB', 'Mashchuk VN', 'Khuazheva NK', 'Kaporskaia TS', 'Golubeva ME', 'Maksimov AG', 'Ploskikh MA', ""Men'shakova SN"", ""Mal'tsev VI"", 'Rossiev VA', 'Pilipenko GI']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Leukopenia/blood/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Opportunistic Infections/blood/epidemiology/etiology', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Remission Induction', 'Russia']",2010/09/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2010;82(7):5-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the three effector cell populations activate Akt1/PKBalpha through the engagement of this molecule. Upon binding to leukemic cells expressing NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including chronic lymphocytic leukemias treated with transretinoic acid, most gammadeltaT (>60%) and half CD8(+) alphabetaT cells (about 50%) received a survival signal, at variance with the majority of NK cells (>80%) that underwent apoptosis by day 5. Interestingly, oligomerization of NKG2D in gammadeltaT or CD8(+) alphabetaT cells, led to a significant rise in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of both NF-kBp52 and RelB, the two NF-kB subunits mainly involved in the transcription of antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl family. Indeed, the ratio between the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) and the proapoptotic protein Bax raised in gammadeltaT or CD8(+) alphabetaT cells following NKG2D engagement by specific monoclonal antibodies or by NKG2DL expressing leukemic cells. Conversely, nuclear translocation of NF-kBp52 or RelB did not increase, nor the Bcl-2/Bax or the Bcl-x(L) /Bax ratios changed significantly, in NK cells upon oligomerizaton of NKG2D. Of note, transcripts for alpha5 importin, responsible for nuclear translocation of NF-kBp52/Rel B heterodimer, are significantly higher in gammadeltaT and CD8(+) alphabetaT cells than in NK cells. These biochemical data may explain, at least in part, why gammadeltaT and CD8(+) alphabetaT cells are cytolytic effector cells more resistant to target-induced apoptosis than NK cells.","['Poggi, Alessandro', 'Zancolli, Marta', 'Boero, Silvia', 'Catellani, Silvia', 'Musso, Alessandra', 'Zocchi, Maria Raffaella']","['Poggi A', 'Zancolli M', 'Boero S', 'Catellani S', 'Musso A', 'Zocchi MR']","['Unit of Molecular Oncology and Angiogenesis, National Institute for Cancer Research, I-16132 Genoa. alessandro.poggi@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101103,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25682 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Jul 15;129(2):387-96. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25682.

Clinical and experimental research of the last two decades has demonstrated that acute leukaemia is the consequence of multiple collaborative molecular aberrations affecting protein kinases and transcriptional regulators induced by genetic alterations and/or epigenetic mechanisms. New technologies have been developed to detect aberrations of the entire (epi)genome of a leukaemic blast that will result in a long list of potential therapeutic targets needing to be functionally validated in cellular and animal leukaemia models. Using these methods, several ""druggable"" protein kinases have been identified. These kinases exert their oncogenic potential not only through expansion of the leukaemic clone, but also by regulating critical interactions of leukaemic stem cells with the microenvironment. Due to the molecular complexity of acute leukaemia, new functional genome-wide screens have been established and may help to identify targets that when blocked result in synthetic lethality of the leukaemic blasts harbouring distinct (epi)genomic lesions.

Here we show that most murine T-ALLs harbor Notch1 deletions that fall into 2 types, both leading to ligand-independent Notch1 activation. Type 1 deletions remove exon 1 and the proximal promoter, appear to be RAG-mediated, and are associated with mRNA transcripts that initiate from 3' regions of Notch1. In line with the RAG dependency of these rearrangements, RAG2 binds to the 5' end of Notch1 in normal thymocytes near the deletion breakpoints. Type 2 deletions remove sequences between exon 1 and exons 26 to 28 of Notch1, appear to be RAG-independent, and are associated with transcripts in which exon 1 is spliced out of frame to 3' Notch1 exons. Translation of both types of transcripts initiates at a conserved methionine residue, M1727, which lies within the Notch1 transmembrane domain. Polypeptides initiating at M1727 insert into membranes and are subject to constitutive cleavage by gamma-secretase. Thus, like human T-ALL, murine T-ALL is often associated with acquired mutations that cause ligand-independent Notch1 activation.","['Ashworth, Todd D', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Chiang, Mark Y', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Mastio, Jerome', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Kelliher, Michelle', 'Kastner, Philippe', 'Chan, Susan', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Ashworth TD', 'Pear WS', 'Chiang MY', 'Blacklow SC', 'Mastio J', 'Xu L', 'Kelliher M', 'Kastner P', 'Chan S', 'Aster JC']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100917,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60340-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-286328 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 16;116(25):5455-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-286328.

Despite this success, about half of the patients do not respond to treatment or suffer from a relapse and additional therapy is required. A low CD20-expression level may in part be responsible for resistance against rituximab. We therefore investigated whether the CD20-expression level related resistance to rituximab could be overcome by a new group of CD20 mAbs (HuMab-7D8 and ofatumumab) targeting a unique membrane-proximal epitope on the CD20 molecule. DESIGN AND METHODS: By retroviral transduction of the CD20 gene into CD20-negative cells and clonal selection of transduced cells a system was developed in which the CD20-expression level is the only variable. These CD20 transduced cells were used to study the impact of rituximab and HuMab-7D8 mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity. To study the in vivo efficacy of these mAbs an in vivo imaging system was generated by retroviral expression of the luciferase gene in the CD20-positive cells. RESULTS: We show that HuMab-7D8 efficiently killed CD20(low) cells that are not susceptible to rituximab-induced killing in vitro. In a mouse xenograft model, we observed a comparable increase in survival time between HuMab-7D8 and rituximab-treated mice. Most significantly, however, HuMab-7D8 eradicated all CD20-expressing cells both in the periphery as well as in the bone marrow whereas after rituximab treatment CD20(low) cells survived. CONCLUSIONS: Cells that are insensitive to in vitro and in vivo killing by rituximab as the result of their low CD20-expression profile may be efficiently killed by an antibody against the membrane-proximal epitope on CD20. Such antibodies should, therefore, be explored to overcome rituximab resistance in the clinic.","['van Meerten, Tom', 'Rozemuller, Henk', 'Hol, Samantha', 'Moerer, Petra', 'Zwart, Mieke', 'Hagenbeek, Anton', 'Mackus, Wendy J M', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Ebeling, Saskia B', 'Martens, Anton C']","['van Meerten T', 'Rozemuller H', 'Hol S', 'Moerer P', 'Zwart M', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Mackus WJ', 'Parren PW', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Ebeling SB', 'Martens AC']","['Department of Immunology, Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands. tmeerten@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100917,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Epitopes)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements/methods', 'Membrane Microdomains/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Transport', 'Rituximab', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/09/21 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.025783 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.025783 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Dec;95(12):2063-71. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.025783.

The anatomopathological examination of the operative specimen demonstrated infiltration of the larynx and squamous cell carcinoma adenopathies and CLL. It was decided to monitor the chronic lymphoid leukemia, classified as Binet stage B. The synchronous or metachronous onset of a second cancer in a patient with CLL is more frequent than in the general population. The synchronous association of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and CLL has been described only rarely. The therapeutic strategy should focus first on the cancer with the shortest survival rate.

This study was performed to determine the effects of mifepristone on OPN, LIF and IL-6 mRNA and protein expressions in the villi in early pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-nine healthy women seeking termination of pregnancy up to 40 days' gestation were recruited. The study group (n=14) was given 150 mg mifepristone 24 h before vacuum aspiration. The control group (n=15) was not given any treatment prior to vacuum aspiration. Villi were collected, and immunohistochemical analysis and real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) were used to detect the locations and the expression levels of OPN, IL-6 and LIF mRNA. RESULTS: In the study group, the expression level of OPN protein in the villous trophoblast and stoma cells was significantly lower (p<.01), while the expression levels of IL-6 and LIF protein were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<.01, p<.05, respectively).

CONCLUSION: OPN, IL-6 and LIF may have critical roles in human pregnancy maintenance. These three factors may be involved in the immunological reaction initiated by mifepristone.","['Pei, Kaiyan', 'Yu, Cuihua', 'Shi, Xinquan', 'Jia, Mengchun']","['Pei K', 'Yu C', 'Shi X', 'Jia M']","[""Department of Reproductive Endocrinology, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, People's Republic of China. psmile1971@163.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100523,United States,Contraception,Contraception,0234361,"['0 (Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Chorionic Villi/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mifepristone/*pharmacology', 'Osteopontin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2009/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0010-7824(10)00146-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.contraception.2010.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Contraception. 2010 Oct;82(4):379-84. doi: 10.1016/j.contraception.2010.04.009.

However, the mechanism underlying GLA-induced cytotoxicity remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the effect of GLA induction on apoptosis, the mitochondria-mediated death pathway and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human leukemia cells (HL-60). GLA could induce a dose-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells as characterized by cell morphology, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, -9 and an increased expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) loss and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol were observed during the induction. Moreover, GLA caused a time- and dose-dependent elevation of intracellular ROS level in HL-60 cells, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, a well-known antioxidant) could block GLA-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. These data suggest that GLA induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells through ROS-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction pathway.","['Gao, Li Wen', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Yang, Wen Hua', 'Wang, Bin', 'Wang, Jian Wen']","['Gao LW', 'Zhang J', 'Yang WH', 'Wang B', 'Wang JW']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100917,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '79498-31-0 (glaucocalyxin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/05/18 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(10)00228-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2010.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2011 Feb;25(1):51-63. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2010.09.006.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We correlated chimerism in 75 AML patients (38 male, 37 female) who underwent myeloablative (n = 36)/reduced (n = 39) allo-HSCT with the risk of relapse and survival. Chimerism was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for donor/recipient specific polymorphisms/Y-specific sequences. RESULTS: After HSCT, 40 patients (53%) achieved stable complete donor chimerism (>/= 99.0% of donor alleles), while 35 (47%) failed to achieve stable donor chimerism. Thirty-one patients (41%) showed decreasing donor alleles after having first achieved complete donor chimerism. To investigate the kinetics of mixed chimerism, patients were separated whether they showed subsequent increasing or decreasing donor alleles. Subsequent decrease of donor alleles was associated with relapses in 17 of 18 cases (94%), while no patient with subsequent increasing donor alleles relapsed (p < 0.001). Patients with mixed chimerism and increasing donor alleles had better 2-year disease-free survival (85%) than those with decreasing donor alleles (0%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of mixed chimerism as assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is an important prognostic predictor in the post-transplantation period of AML patients.","['Wiedemann, Bettina', 'Klyuchnikov, Evgeny', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Stahl, Tanja', 'Zeschke, Silke', 'Badbaran, Anita', 'Ayuk, Francis', 'Alchalby, Haefaa', 'Wolschke, Christine', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Zander, Axel Rolf', 'Bacher, Ulrike']","['Wiedemann B', 'Klyuchnikov E', 'Kroger N', 'Zabelina T', 'Stahl T', 'Zeschke S', 'Badbaran A', 'Ayuk F', 'Alchalby H', 'Wolschke C', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Fehse B', 'Zander AR', 'Bacher U']","['Interdisciplinary Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hamburg, Martinistrasse 52, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100917,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Chimera']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00370-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Dec;38(12):1261-71. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.08.006.

When PG is associated with fever, it can mimic infectious cellulitis. When it is located on the breast, unnecessary and deleterious surgical debridement may be performed. We present two cases of PG of the breast. The first is a postoperative PG and the second was associated with acute myeloid leukaemia - both led to unnecessary surgery. Several elements may have helped to make the diagnosis: nipples little affected by PG, symmetrical lesions on both breasts, other similar lesions elsewhere on the body, resistance to wide spectrum antibiotherapy, complete blood count abnormalities and negativity of bacterial culture. We propose an index to help the surgeon in his decision to realise a surgical debridement or to postpone it and consider the diagnosis of PG.","['Duval, A', 'Boissel, N', 'Servant, J M', 'Santini, C', 'Petit, A', 'Vignon-Pennamen, M D']","['Duval A', 'Boissel N', 'Servant JM', 'Santini C', 'Petit A', 'Vignon-Pennamen MD']","['Dermatology department, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France. arnaudduval@netcourrier.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100918,Netherlands,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",101264239,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Breast/*pathology/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Debridement/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Mastectomy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin Ulcer/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wound Healing/physiology']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1748-6815(10)00432-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bjps.2010.07.022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2011 Jan;64(1):e17-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.07.022.

20850381,NLM,MEDLINE,20101101,20211020,1474-5488 (Electronic) 1470-2045 (Linking),11,10,2010 Oct,"Assessment of dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant in doxorubicin-treated children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: long-term follow-up of a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial.",950-61,10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70204-7 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin chemotherapy is associated with cardiomyopathy. Dexrazoxane reduces cardiac damage during treatment with doxorubicin in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We aimed to establish the long-term effect of dexrazoxane on the subclinical state of cardiac health in survivors of childhood high-risk ALL 5 years after completion of doxorubicin treatment. METHODS: Between January, 1996, and September, 2000, children with high-risk ALL were enrolled from nine centres in the USA, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Patients were assigned by block randomisation to receive ten doses of 30 mg/m(2) doxorubicin alone or the same dose of doxorubicin preceded by 300 mg/m(2) dexrazoxane. Treatment assignment was obtained through a telephone call to a centralised registrar to conceal allocation. Investigators were masked to treatment assignment but treating physicians and patients were not; however, investigators, physicians, and patients were masked to study serum cardiac troponin-T concentrations and echocardiographic measurements. The primary endpoints were late left ventricular structure and function abnormalities as assessed by echocardiography; analyses were done including all patients with data available after treatment completion. This trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00165087. FINDINGS: 100 children were assigned to doxorubicin (66 analysed) and 105 to doxorubicin plus dexrazoxane (68 analysed). 5 years after the completion of doxorubicin chemotherapy, mean left ventricular fractional shortening and end-systolic dimension Z scores were significantly worse than normal for children who received doxorubicin alone (left ventricular fractional shortening: -0.82, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.33; end-systolic dimension: 0.57, 0.21-0.93) but not for those who also received dexrazoxane (-0.41, -0.88 to 0.06; 0.15, -0.20 to 0.51). The protective effect of dexrazoxane, relative to doxorubicin alone, on left ventricular wall thickness (difference between groups: 0.47, 0.46-0.48) and thickness-to-dimension ratio (0.66, 0.64-0.68) were the only statistically significant characteristics at 5 years. Subgroup analysis showed dexrazoxane protection (p=0.04) for left ventricular fractional shortening at 5 years in girls (1.17, 0.24-2.11), but not in boys (-0.10, -0.87 to 0.68). Similarly, subgroup analysis showed dexrazoxane protection (p=0.046) for the left ventricular thickness-to-dimension ratio at 5 years in girls (1.15, 0.44-1.85), but not in boys (0.19, -0.42 to 0.81). With a median follow-up for recurrence and death of 8.7 years (range 1.3-12.1), event-free survival was 77% (95% CI 67-84) for children in the doxorubicin-alone group, and 76% (67-84) for children in the doxorubicin plus dexrazoxane group (p=0.99). INTERPRETATION: Dexrazoxane provides long-term cardioprotection without compromising oncological efficacy in doxorubicin-treated children with high-risk ALL. Dexrazoxane exerts greater long-term cardioprotective effects in girls than in boys.

Today, DRE is mainly marketed for management of gastrointestinal and liver disorders. The current study aims to determine the anti-cancer activity of dandelion root extract (DRE) against human leukemia, and to evaluate the specificity and mechanism of DRE-induced apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of DRE on cell viability was evaluated using the colorimetric-based WST-1 assay. Apoptotic cell death was monitored by nuclear condensation and confirmed by exposure of phosphatidylserine to outer leaflet of plasma membrane. Activation of caspases was detected using a fluorogenic substrate specific to either caspase-8 or -3. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed by microscopy using JC-1 dye. The apoptotic effect of DRE was also evaluated on a dominant-negative FADD (Fas-associated death domain) cell line and non-cancerous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS: Aqueous DRE effectively induces apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines in a dose and time dependent manner. Very early activation of caspase-8 and the subsequent activation of caspase-3 indicate that DRE may be inducing extrinsic or receptor-mediated apoptosis. Caspase inhibition rendered this extract ineffective, thus DRE-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent. Moreover, the dominant-negative FADD cells that are unable to form a complete DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) were resistant to DRE treatment, which further confirms our hypothesis that DRE induces receptor-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, non-cancerous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to aqueous DRE under the same treatment conditions as leukemia cells were not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that aqueous DRE contains components that act to induce apoptosis selectively in cultured leukemia cells, emphasizing the importance of this traditional medicine and thus presents a potential novel non-toxic alternative to conventional leukemia therapy.","['Ovadje, P', 'Chatterjee, S', 'Griffin, C', 'Tran, C', 'Hamm, C', 'Pandey, S']","['Ovadje P', 'Chatterjee S', 'Griffin C', 'Tran C', 'Hamm C', 'Pandey S']","['Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Roots', '*Taraxacum']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(10)00643-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2010.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2011 Jan 7;133(1):86-91. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2010.09.005.

RR is upregulated in tumor cells and therefore considered to be an excellent target for cancer chemotherapy. ABNM-13 (N-hydroxy-2-(anthracene-2-yl-methylene)-hydrazinecarboximidamide), a novel N-hydroxy-N'-aminoguanidine has been designed to inhibit RR activity using 3D molecular space modeling techniques. In this study, we evaluated its effect on human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. ABNM-13 proved to be a potent inhibitor of RR which was displayed by significant alterations of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool balance and a highly significant decrease of incorporation of radiolabeled cytidine into DNA of HL-60 cells. Diminished RR activity caused replication stress which was consistent with activation of Chk1 and Chk2, resulting in downregulation/degradation of Cdc25A. In contrast, Cdc25B was upregulated, leading to dephosphorylation and activation of Cdk1. The combined disregulation of Cdc25A and Cdc25B was the most likely cause for ABNM-13 induced S-phase arrest. Finally, we combined ABNM-13 with the first-line antileukemic agent arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) and found that ABNM-13 synergistically potentiated the antineoplastic effects of Ara-C. Due to these promising results, ABNM-13 deserves further preclinical and in vivo testing.","['Saiko, Philipp', 'Graser, Geraldine', 'Giessrigl, Benedikt', 'Lackner, Andreas', 'Grusch, Michael', 'Krupitza, Georg', 'Basu, Arijit', 'Sinha, Barij Nayan', 'Jayaprakash, Venkatesan', 'Jaeger, Walter', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Szekeres, Thomas']","['Saiko P', 'Graser G', 'Giessrigl B', 'Lackner A', 'Grusch M', 'Krupitza G', 'Basu A', 'Sinha BN', 'Jayaprakash V', 'Jaeger W', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T']","['Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, General Hospital of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (antineoplastic agent K 18)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""36778-67-3 (N-hydroxy-N'-aminoguanidine)"", 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Guanidines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Melphalan/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2010/09/21 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00662-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Jan 1;81(1):50-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.09.006.

Resistance to GC therapy is associated with poor prognosis. Although they have been used in clinics for decades, the signal transduction pathways involved in GC-induced apoptosis have only partly been resolved. Accumulating evidence shows that this cell death process is mediated by a communication between nuclear GR affecting gene transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bim, mitochondrial GR affecting the physiology of the mitochondria, and the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), which interacts with Bim following exposure to GCs. Prevention of Bim up-regulation, mitochondrial GR translocation, and/or GSK3 activation are common causes leading to GC therapy failure. Various protein kinases positively regulating the pro-survival Src-PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Raf-Ras-MEK-ERK signal cascades have been shown to be activated in malignant leukemic cells and antagonize GC-induced apoptosis by inhibiting GSK3 activation and Bim expression. Targeting these protein kinases has proven effective in sensitizing GR-positive malignant lymphoid cells to GC-induced apoptosis. Thus, intervening with the pro-survival kinase network in GC-resistant cells should be a good means of improving GC therapy of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Kfir-Erenfeld, Shlomit', 'Sionov, Ronit Vogt', 'Spokoini, Rachel', 'Cohen, Orly', 'Yefenof, Eitan']","['Kfir-Erenfeld S', 'Sionov RV', 'Spokoini R', 'Cohen O', 'Yefenof E']","['The Lautenberg Center of Immunology and Cancer Research, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100920,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.506570 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Nov;51(11):1968-2005. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.506570.

NPM1A mutation levels and chimerism ratios were determined in non-separated BM/PB. We observed congruent results in 28/38 (74%). In 14/38 sample pairs (37%), BM and PB were negative for the NPM1A mutation. Fourteen sample pairs were positive in BM and PB, albeit at higher mutation levels in the BM in 11 cases (4- to 278-fold). Results were discordant in 10 cases (26%), with weakly positive mutation levels in the BM but negative levels in the PB. Cases with >/=0.2% NPM1A mutation level in BM were always positive in PB. Chimerism was concordant in BM and PB in 21/34 (62%) of sample pairs. In conclusion, MRD monitoring with qPCR for the NPM1 mutation and chimerism from non-separated PB contributes to surveillance in patients with AML in the post-transplant period, but even with highly sensitive qPCR there is a risk of failure to detect the mutation in PB.","['Stahl, Tanja', 'Badbaran, Anita', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Klyuchnikov, Evgeny', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Zeschke, Silke', 'Schafhausen, Philippe', 'Schultz, Waltraud', 'Asenova, Svetlana', 'Smirnova, Anna', 'Wolschke, Christine', 'Ayuk, Francis', 'Zander, Axel R', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Bacher, Ulrike']","['Stahl T', 'Badbaran A', 'Kroger N', 'Klyuchnikov E', 'Zabelina T', 'Zeschke S', 'Schafhausen P', 'Schultz W', 'Asenova S', 'Smirnova A', 'Wolschke C', 'Ayuk F', 'Zander AR', 'Fehse B', 'Bacher U']","['Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Postoperative Period', 'Transplantation Chimera/blood', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.508822 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Oct;51(10):1837-43. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.508822.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, numerous adverse effects limited their use.

The dendrimers act as carriers and an N-(2-hydroxyethyl)maleimide spacer between drug and carrier should guarantee a selective release of the cytostatics in the tumor cells. The resulting cytotoxicity was determined in vitro using the human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. It was demonstrated that melphalan caused cytotoxic effects depending on its free amino group (Boc protection strongly decreased the activity) but independent of a derivation of the carboxylic group (dendrimers and spacer binding). Esterification of bendamustine with the N-(2-hydroxyethyl)maleimide spacer strongly increased the hydrolytic stability of the N-lost moiety, so antiproliferative effects were yet observed in vitro.","['Scutaru, Ana Maria', 'Wenzel, Maxi', 'Scheffler, Heike', 'Wolber, Gerhard', 'Gust, Ronald']","['Scutaru AM', 'Wenzel M', 'Scheffler H', 'Wolber G', 'Gust R']","['Institute fur Pharmazie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Dendrimers)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendrimers/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Melphalan/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nanoconjugates/*chemistry', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Particle Size', 'Permeability']",2010/09/21 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/09/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc900453f [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2010 Oct 20;21(10):1728-43. doi: 10.1021/bc900453f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ninety two CSF samples were analyzed with 4-color flow cytometry.

The results of flow cytometry were compared with conventional cell count and morphology. Flow cytometry analysis was repeated for five samples 48 hours after the initial test. RESULTS: Abnormal cells were found in 33 out of the 92 (35.9%) samples. Among the 59 samples taken from patients with lymphocyte neoplasm, CD19 + blast cells were found in the CSF in 13 patients with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia; CD7+ blast cells were found in 4 T-ALL cases; and monoclonal CD19+ cells were found in 6 other types of lymphoma cases. In the 32 patients with clinically diagnosed myeloid leukemia, CD117+ myeloid cells were found in the CSF of 7 patients and B cell blast cells were found in 2 CML cases. The abnormal cells in the CSF detected by immunophenotyping decreased significantly 48 hours after the initial test. Abnormal cells were detected in 25 samples (27.2%) by morphology, less than those detected by immunophenotyping. The cell concentrations of the eight samples in which abnormal cells were only detected by flow cytometry were lower than 10 X 10(6)/L. The immunophenotyping results of two ALL patients were still positive when morphologic results had become negative after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Flow cytometric analysis of CSF may be helpful in the diagnosis of meningeal leukemia.

However, vaccination of those who have remained in continuous complete remission for 1 year and are receiving chemotherapy is still considered a reasonable option. There is little available data to allow a comparison of the risk versus benefit of vaccinating these patients. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed mortality due to varicella in the records of 15 pediatric ALL study groups throughout Europe, Asia, and North America during the period 1984-2008. RESULTS: We found that 20 of 35,128 children with ALL (0.057%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.037-0.088%) died of VZV infection. The mortality rate was lower in North America (3 of 11,558 children, 0.026%; 95% CI, 0.009-0.076%) than in the Asian countries (2 of 4,882 children, 0.041%; 95% CI, 0.011-0.149%) and in Europe (15 of 18,688 children, 0.080%; 95% CI, 0.049-0.132%) consistent with the generally higher rate of VZV vaccination in North America. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) died during the first year of treatment for ALL. One death was attributed to varicella vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The negligible rate of fatal varicella infection in children with ALL, the risk that accompanies vaccination, and the necessity of withholding chemotherapy for vaccination appear to outweigh the potential benefit of varicella vaccination for children during treatment of ALL.","['Caniza, Miguela A', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Masera, Giuseppe']","['Caniza MA', 'Hunger SP', 'Schrauder A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Pui CH', 'Masera G']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. miguela.caniza@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chickenpox/*complications/*therapy/virology', 'Chickenpox Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy/virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vaccination']",2010/09/18 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2010/09/18 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22759 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jan;58(1):12-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22759.

However, the initial responses of the ONH to elevated IOP are unknown. Here the authors use a rat glaucoma model to characterize ONH gene expression changes associated with early optic nerve injury. METHODS: Unilateral IOP elevation was produced in rats by episcleral vein injection of hypertonic saline. ONH mRNA was extracted, and retrobulbar optic nerve cross-sections were graded for axonal degeneration. Gene expression was determined by microarray and quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis. Significantly altered gene expression was determined by multiclass analysis and ANOVA. DAVID gene ontology determined the functional categories of significantly affected genes. RESULTS: The Early Injury group consisted of ONH from eyes with <15% axon degeneration. By array analysis, 877 genes were significantly regulated in this group. The most significant upregulated gene categories were cell cycle, cytoskeleton, and immune system process, whereas the downregulated categories included glucose and lipid metabolism. QPCR confirmed the upregulation of cell cycle-associated genes and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) and revealed alterations in expression of other IL-6-type cytokines and Jak-Stat signaling pathway components, including increased expression of IL-6 (1553%). In contrast, astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) message levels were unaltered, and other astrocytic markers were significantly downregulated. Microglial activation and vascular-associated gene responses were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Cell proliferation and IL-6-type cytokine gene expression, rather than astrocyte hypertrophy, characterize early pressure-induced ONH injury.","['Johnson, Elaine C', 'Doser, Thomas A', 'Cepurna, William O', 'Dyck, Jennifer A', 'Jia, Lijun', 'Guo, Ying', 'Lambert, Wendi S', 'Morrison, John C']","['Johnson EC', 'Doser TA', 'Cepurna WO', 'Dyck JA', 'Jia L', 'Guo Y', 'Lambert WS', 'Morrison JC']","['Kenneth C.

In addition, we present evidence that ERK pathways activated by ZAP70 and SHP2 reduce the protein level of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor.

METHODS: Female RNs registered with a professional regulatory body for at least one year between 1974 and 2000 formed the cohort (n = 56,213). The identifier file was linked to Canadian cancer registries. An RN offspring cohort from 1986 was created by linkages with the BC Birth and Health Status Registries. Exposure was assessed by work history in oncology or cancer agencies (method 1) and by estimating weighted duration of exposure developed from a survey of pharmacists and nursing unit administrators of all provincial hospitals and treatment centers and the work history of the nurses (method 2). Relative risks (RR) were calculated using Poisson regression for cancer incidence and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for congenital anomaly, stillbirth, low birth weight, and prematurity incidence, with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: In comparison with other female RNs, method 1 revealed that RNs who ever worked in a cancer center or in an oncology nursing unit had an increased risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.03 - 3.23, 12 cases) and their offspring were at risk for congenital anomalies of the eye (OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 1.08 - 11.14, 3 cases). Method 2 revealed that RNs classified as having the highest weighted durations of exposure to antineoplastic drugs had an excess risk of cancer of the rectum (RR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.07 - 3.29, 14 cases). No statistically significant increased risks of leukemia, other cancers, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, or other congenital anomalies in the RNs' offspring were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Female RNs having had potential exposure to antineoplastic drugs were not found to have an excess risk of leukemia, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies in their offspring, with the exception of congenital anomalies of the eye, based on only three cases; however, elevated risks of breast and rectal cancer were observed.","['Ratner, Pamela A', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Beking, Kris', 'Lorenzi, Maria', 'Chow, Yat', 'Teschke, Kay', 'Le, Nhu D', 'Gallagher, Richard P', 'Dimich-Ward, Helen']","['Ratner PA', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Beking K', 'Lorenzi M', 'Chow Y', 'Teschke K', 'Le ND', 'Gallagher RP', 'Dimich-Ward H']","['School of Nursing, University of British Columbia, 302-6190 Agronomy Road, Vancouver, V6T 1Z3, Canada. pam.ratner@ubc.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100916,England,BMC Nurs,BMC nursing,101088683,,,,2010/09/18 06:00,2010/09/18 06:01,['2010/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:01 [medline]']","['1472-6955-9-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6955-9-15 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Nurs. 2010 Sep 16;9:15. doi: 10.1186/1472-6955-9-15.,,PMC2949748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the results of therapy with single agent rituximab in 21 patients with CLL-associated IT. The mean age at CLL and IT diagnosis was 64 and 68 yr, respectively. IT developed at a mean time of 44 months from the diagnosis of CLL. In four cases, IT was diagnosed at the same time as CLL. For three patients, IT was considered fludarabine-related and two patients showed autoimmune hemolysis also. All patients but one received steroids as first-line treatment for IT. Some patients received intravenous high-dose Ig, vincristine, and Cytoxan also, without beneficial effect. After a mean time of 43 d from the diagnosis of IT, all patients were scheduled to receive rituximab at a dosage of 375 mg/mq/weekly. RESULTS: Eighteen (86%) patients completed the scheduled four cycles of rituximab. Irrelevant first infusion side effects were seen only in one patient.

Most precursor lymphoblastic lymphoma are T-cell lineage and precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma constitutes only about 10% of cases according to the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematologic and Lymphoid Tissues. The most frequent sites of involvement in precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma are the skin, soft tissue, bone and lymph nodes. Primary appendiceal involvement is an uncommon condition. We present an unusual case of primary appendiceal precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma in an 11-year-old boy with peculiar histological morphology mimicking diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Histologically, the tumor was composed of diffusely infiltrated large cells from mucosa and extended to the subserosal area. The tumor cells were positive to CD79a, CD20, PAX5, BCL2, CD10, TdT, p53 but not to CD3, BCL6 and CD34 by immunohistochemical studies. The response to conventional treatment regimen for lymphoblastic lymphoma was not good, with early relapse within three months. Partial remission was achieved by adding rituximab. Unfortunately, the patient died in ten months due to uncontrolled relapsed disease with generalized lymphadenopathy and massive pleural effusion. The special morphologic changes and poor response to chemotherapy may be related to the overexpression of p53.","['Wang, Ren-Ching', 'Jan, Yee-Jee', 'Wen, Mei-Chin', 'Wang, John', 'Hsieh, Pin-Pen']","['Wang RC', 'Jan YJ', 'Wen MC', 'Wang J', 'Hsieh PP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taichung Veteran General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,IM,"['Appendiceal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",2010/09/18 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/09/18 06:00'],"['2010/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.2010.02581.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2010 Oct;60(10):690-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2010.02581.x.,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Prognostic significance of lymphocytes was analyzed as a ratio of relative number of T cells to the size of the malignant monoclonal B-cell pool (T/NK cells:Malignant monoclonal B-cells ratio). Patients showed higher relative number of CD4 (p = 0.03), CD8 (p = 0.02), and NK cells (p = 0.01) in early Rai stage of disease. The multivariate Cox analysis identified the relative number of CD8 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.464; p = 0.006) and CD4 T cells (HR = 0.091; p < 0.01) as independent predictors for survival.

However, there is no available information to address the effects of CHM-1 on leukemia cells in vivo. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of CHM-1 using a mouse model of leukemia. We established leukemia in mice by injecting WEHI-3 cells into BALB/c mice. Mice were then treated with or without CHM-1 (5 and 10 mg/kg). CHM-1 promoted the total survival rate of leukemic mice and these effects were dose-dependent. CHM-1 increased body weight and decreased spleen weight, but did not affect liver weight. The levels of cell markers Mac-3 and CD11b were reduced by CHM-1, indicating that the differentiation of macrophage precursor cells was inhibited. Levels of CD3 and CD19 were induced by CHM-1, suggesting that the differentiation of precursors of T and B cells was promoted in PBMC. Results of the present study indicate that CHM-1 has an inhibitory effect on leukemia induced in mice in vivo and warrants further study as to the mechanisms and effects in other types of cancer.","['Lai, Tung-Yuan', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Wu, Ping-Ping', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu', 'Ma, Chia-Yu', 'Gibson Wood, W', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Lai TY', 'Yang JS', 'Wu PP', 'Huang WW', 'Kuo SC', 'Ma CY', 'Gibson Wood W', 'Chung JG']","['School of Post-baccalaureate Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung,Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100917,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"[""0 (2'-fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quinolone)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Quinolones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dioxoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Leukemia/mortality/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",2010/09/18 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/09/18 06:00'],"['2010/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.517279 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Nov;51(11):2098-102. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.517279.

The 10-year event-free survival ranged from 77 to 85% after having achieved complete remission rates of 93% or higher. The main cause of treatment failure is relapse arising from outgrowth of residual leukemic cells that are refractory to therapy. An intense effort has been made to develop methods to determine the degree of minimal residual leukemia cells present in patients considered to be in morphological remission. Because of the strong correlation between minimal residual disease (MRD) levels and risk of relapse, monitoring of MRD provides unique information regarding treatment response. The MRD monitoring based on real-time quantitative PCR detection of patient-specific immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene rearrangements is currently considered to be the most reliable tool for MRD-based diagnosis in ALL. Because the significance of MRD monitoring has been strongly supported by several studies and because it has been implemented in the latest protocols, there has been a significant effort to develop MRD monitoring in the Slovak Republic since 2005. Between October 2006 and December 2009, 50 children with ALL who were treated at three Slovak centers were included in the RQ PCR MRD pilot project. A total of 40 patients with BCP-ALL ( B cell precursor ALL) and 4 patients with T ALL were analyzed for Ig/TCR rearrangement. We identified 106 different rearrangements in the 44 ALL patients analyzed. Based on MRD stratification, we identified 26 patients who were stratified into the HRG ( high risk group) (n = 3; 11.5%), IRG ( intermediate risk group) (n = 14; 54%) and SRG ) standard risk group) (n = 9; 34.5%).

The computer assisted nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA image densitometry, reflecting the nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA concentration at the single cell level, demonstrated a remarkable stability during the differentiation and maturation of B- lymphocytes. In contrast, as it was expected, the nucleolar diameter during the lymphocytic development markedly decreased. Thus the nucleolar RNA content of leukemic B-lymphocytes was apparently related to the nucleolar size. In both immature and mature lymphocytes, the cytostatic treatment increased the incidence of micronucleoli, which represent the ""inactive"" type of nucleoli. However, the decreased values of the nucleolar diameter were statistically significant only in mature lymphocytes of treated patients. On the other hand, despite such observation, it must be mentioned that ""large active"" and ""ring shaped resting"" nucleoli were still present in immature and mature lymphocytes after the cytostatic therapy and such cells might represent a potential pool of proliferating cells. As it is generally accepted ""large active nucleoli"" with multiple fibrillar centers are known to be characteristic for proliferating cells. ""Ring shaped resting nucleoli"" are present in sleeping cells, which may be stimulated to return to the cell cycle and to proliferate again. In addition, the nucleolar RNA distribution also indicated that Gumprecht ghosts mostly originated from mature lymphocytes. Increased ratio of the nucleolar to cytoplasmic RNA density in Gumprecht ghosts or apoptotic cells and apoptotic bodies of the lymphocytic origin was related to the decreased cytoplasmic RNA concentration. The increased nucleolar size together with the markedly decreased cytoplasmic RNA concentration characteristic for Gumprecht ghosts just reflected the spreading of lymphocytes during smear preparations. In apoptotic cells or bodies of the lymphocytic origin, the ""frozen"" nucleolar RNA concentration accompanied by a reduced RNA concentration in the cytoplasm exhibited a remarkable similarity to the apoptotic process induced in vitro by the cytostatic treatment.

Although some patients may fail on therapy with imatinib, effective salvage therapy is available with second-generation TKIs. Current measurement of efficacy for each therapy is judged by its individual impact on overall survival and event-free survival (EFS). METHODS: In total, 586 patients with CML in CP who received imatinib were included in this analysis in 2 cohorts: imatinib as front-line therapy (n = 281) or after failure on interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) (n = 305). By accounting for successful salvage treatment (ie, regain of complete cytogenetic response), the current EFS (CEFS) rate was calculated to obtain a more accurate impression of the outcome of patients with CML who received treatment with sequential TKIs. RESULTS: For patients who received imatinib after failing on IFN-alpha, the 7-year EFS rate was 61%, whereas the CEFS rate was 69%. The 7-year EFS rate for patients who received imatinib as initial therapy was 81% compared with a 7-year CEFS rate of 88%. CONCLUSIONS: CEFS provided a more accurate representation of the outcome of patients with CML in CP. These patients may frequently be treated successfully with subsequent TKIs after experiencing failure on the first TKI.","['Al-Kali, Aref', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Al-Kali A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Shan J', 'Bassett R', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Borthakur G', 'Jabbour E', 'Verstovsek S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The activity of NF-kappaB is tightly controlled through its cytoplasmic sequestration by specific inhibitors, IkappaBs. Various cellular stimuli induce the activation of an IkappaB kinase, which phosphorylates IkappaBs and triggers their proteasomal degradation, causing nuclear translocation of activated NF-kappaB. Under normal conditions, the activation of NF-kappaB occurs transiently, thus ensuring rapid but temporary induction of target genes. Deregulated NF-kappaB activation contributes to the development of various diseases, including cancers and immunological disorders. Accumulated studies demonstrate that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway is a target of several human oncogenic viruses, including the human T cell leukemia virus type 1, the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and the Epstein-Bar virus. These viruses encode specific oncoproteins that target different signaling components of the NF-kappaB pathway, leading to persistent activation of NF-kappaB.

The associated germline mutations are located in the patched gene which is a modulator of the cell cycle. Fanconi anemia represents a chromosomal instability syndrome which is characterized by early onset of pancytopenia, i.e. bone marrow failure and subsequent development of acute myeloid leukemia and/or squamous cell carcinomas, especially of the head and neck. A total of 13 different gene clusters have been identified in 2 DNA associated complexes which play an important role in DNA repair mechanisms.","['Schwarz-Furlan, S', 'Brase, C', 'Stockmann, P', 'Furlan, I', 'Hartmann, A']","['Schwarz-Furlan S', 'Brase C', 'Stockmann P', 'Furlan I', 'Hartmann A']","['Institut fur Pathologie Kaufbeuren, Dr.-Gutermann-Str. 6, 87600, Kaufbeuren. stephan.schwarz@pathologie-kaufbeuren.de']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/genetics/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/pathology', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Eye Enucleation', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/pathology', 'Genomic Instability', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Paraganglioma/genetics/pathology', 'Radiography']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/02/26 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00292-010-1359-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2010 Oct;31(6):477-84. doi: 10.1007/s00292-010-1359-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hereditare Tumoren des Kopf-Hals-Bereichs.,,,,,,

AS602868 is a novel investigational drug with reported activity on AML cells. METHODS: We studied gene expression profiles in AML blasts exposed to AS602868 in order to better understand its mechanism of action. We analyzed the in vitro cytotoxicity of AS602868 alone or in combination with daunorubicin, etoposide or cytarabine. To document AS602868-induced IKK2 inhibition in fresh AML cells, a flow cytometry analysis of IkappaB was performed. Finally, the effect of AS602868 on gene expression in fresh AML cells was analyzed. RESULTS: The results show that AML cells are globally as sensitive to AS602868 as they are to cytarabine, with large interindividual variations. Combinations with conventional antileukemic agents showed enhanced cytotoxic activity in subsets of patients. IKK2 appeared to be effectively inhibited by 100 muM AS602868 in fresh leukemic cells. Gene expression profiling and gene ontology analyses identified several groups of genes induced/inhibited by exposure to AS602868 and/or exhibiting a correlation with sensitivity to this agent in vitro. Of note, the expression of several genes related to immune function was found to be significantly altered after exposure to AS602868. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that AS602868 is cytotoxic against fresh human AML blasts and provide insights regarding the mechanisms of cytotoxicity.","['Jordheim, Lars Petter', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Dreano, Michel', 'Cros-Perrial, Emeline', 'Keime, Celine', 'Herveau, Stephanie', 'Demangel, Delphine', 'Vendrell, Julie A', 'Dumontet, Charles']","['Jordheim LP', 'Plesa A', 'Dreano M', 'Cros-Perrial E', 'Keime C', 'Herveau S', 'Demangel D', 'Vendrell JA', 'Dumontet C']","['Universite Lyon 1, ISPB, Lyon 69003, France. jordheim@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (AS602868)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-010-1458-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2011 Jul;68(1):97-105. doi: 10.1007/s00280-010-1458-y.

Initially, the upregulation was described to be as a result of a translocation. However, further studies revealed that transcriptional upregulation of LYL1could also occur without translocations. In addition, post-translational mechanisms, such as protein degradation could influence LYL1 expression as well. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we considered possible post-translational regulation of Lyl1, and investigated fundamental mechanisms governing LYL1 degradation in cell-based culture assays. We identify a PEST sequence motif located in the N-terminus of LYL1, which determines the efficiency of LYL1 degradation by the proteasome. The absence of the PEST degradation site leads to accumulation or upregulation of LYL1. We also show that LYL1 is phosphorylated by MAPK at S36, and determined that proteasomal degradation of LYL1 occurs in a phosphorylation-independent manner. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding LYL1 degradation is a step forward not only towards deciphering the normal function and regulation of LYL1, but could suggest post-translational mechanisms for upregulation of LYL1 that may contribute to its oncogenic role.","['Lukov, Georgi L', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Lukov GL', 'Goodell MA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100910,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (LYL1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012692 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Sep 10;5(9). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012692.,"['DK58192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL081007/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL081007/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2937031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current paper, the role of PKC delta was examined in fenretinide-induced apoptosis in lymphoid leukemia cells. Levels of proapoptotic cleaved PKC delta positively correlated with drug sensitivity. Fenretinide promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The antioxidant Vitamin C prevented fenretinide-induced PKC delta cleavage and protected cells from fenretinide. Suppression of PKC delta expression by shRNA sensitized cells to fenretinide-induced apoptosis possibly by a mechanism involving ROS production. A previous study demonstrated that fenretinide promotes degradation of antiapoptotic MCL-1 in ALL cells via JNK. Now we have found that fenretinide-induced MCL-1 degradation may involve PKC delta as cleavage of the kinase correlated with loss of MCL-1 even in cells when JNK was not activated. These results suggest that PKC delta may play a complex role in fenretinide-induced apoptosis and may be targeted in antileukemia strategies that utilize fenretinide.","['Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Karanjeet, Kul B', 'Schuster, Todd F', 'Brown, Rhoderick', 'Deng, Yibin', 'Hinchcliffe, Edward', 'Ruvolo, Peter P']","['Ruvolo VR', 'Karanjeet KB', 'Schuster TF', 'Brown R', 'Deng Y', 'Hinchcliffe E', 'Ruvolo PP']","['Section of Signal Transduction and Apoptosis, Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Signal Transduct,Journal of signal transduction,101536934,,,,2010/09/17 06:00,2010/09/17 06:01,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2010/584657 [doi]'],ppublish,J Signal Transduct. 2010 Jan 1;2010:584657. doi: 10.1155/2010/584657.,"['R01 GM045928/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072754/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072754-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2938797,,,,,,['NIHMS213166'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scoring criteria proposed by the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias represented a major attempt to define this disorder. However, the relative weight given to some markers and the lack of lineage specificity of most markers have raised questions regarding the significance of this approach. In 2008, the World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors proposed a simpler diagnostic algorithm, which relies on fewer and more lineage-specific markers to define mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). MPAL with t(9;22) and MLL rearrangement have been separated. Several studies have suggested that patients with acute leukemia of mixed phenotype have a worse clinical outcome when compared with matched controls with acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further studies are needed to confirm the significance of MPAL as currently defined, to determine a standardized treatment approach and to better understand the biological and clinical aspects of this disease.","['Weinberg, O K', 'Arber, D A']","['Weinberg OK', 'Arber DA']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. okw@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/genetics', 'Phenotype']",2010/09/17 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010202 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.202 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1844-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.202.

As most tumor antigens represent self-proteins, high-avidity tumor-specific T cells are largely deleted from the repertoire of the patient. In contrast, T cells from major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donors provide naive repertoires wherein such cells have not been systematically eliminated. Yet, evidence for peptide degeneracy or poly-specificity warrants caution in the use of foreign human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or peptide complexes as therapeutic targets. Here, we cocultured HLA-A(*)0201-negative T cells with autologous dendritic cells engineered to present HLA-A(*)0201 complexed with a peptide from the B cell antigen CD20 (CD20p). HLA-A(*)0201/CD20p pentamer-reactive CD8(+) T cells were readily obtained from all donors. The polyclonal cells showed exquisite peptide and MHC specificity, and efficiently killed HLA-A(*)0201-positive B cells, including primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The T cell receptor (TCR) sequences displayed a novel type of conservation, with extensive homology in the TCR beta chain complementarity-determining region 3 and in J, but not V, region. This is surprising, as the donors were HLA disparate and their TCR repertoires are expected to show little overlap. The results demonstrate the first public recognition motif for an allogeneic HLA/peptide complex.

Three reference groups of immunophenotypic data files-B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL; n = 10), mantle cell (MCL; n = 10) and follicular lymphomas (FL; n = 10)--were built. Subsequently, each of the 175 cases studied was evaluated and assigned to either one of the three reference groups or to none of them (other B-CLPD). Most cases (89%) were correctly assigned to their corresponding WHO diagnostic group with overall positive and negative predictive values of 89 and 96%, respectively. The efficiency of the PCA-based approach was particularly high among typical B-CLL, MCL and FL vs other B-CLPD cases. In summary, PCA-guided immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD is a promising tool for standardized interpretation of tumor IP, their classification into well-defined entities and comprehensive evaluation of antibody panels.","['Costa, E S', 'Pedreira, C E', 'Barrena, S', 'Lecrevisse, Q', 'Flores, J', 'Quijano, S', 'Almeida, J', 'del Carmen Garcia-Macias, M', 'Bottcher, S', 'Van Dongen, J J M', 'Orfao, A']","['Costa ES', 'Pedreira CE', 'Barrena S', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Flores J', 'Quijano S', 'Almeida J', 'del Carmen Garcia-Macias M', 'Bottcher S', 'Van Dongen JJ', 'Orfao A']","['Pediatrics Institute Martagao Gesteira-IPPMG, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro-UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Automation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",2010/09/17 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010160 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.160 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1927-33. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.160.

Utilizing in vitro models of intrinsic drug resistance and stromal-mediated chemoresistance, as well as functional mouse models of progressive and residual disease, we attempted to develop a potential therapeutic approach designed to suppress leukemia recurrence following treatment with selective kinase inhibitors. The novel IAP inhibitor, LCL161, [corrected] was observed to potentiate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibition against leukemic disease both in the absence and presence of a stromal-protected [corrected] environment. LCL161 enhanced the proapoptotic effects of nilotinib and PKC412, against leukemic disease in vitro and potentiated the activity of both kinase inhibitors against leukemic disease in vivo. In addition, LCL161 synergized in vivo with nilotinib to reduce leukemia burden significantly below the baseline level suppression exhibited by a moderate-to-high dose of nilotinib. Finally, LCL161 displayed antiproliferative effects against cells characterized by intrinsic resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a result of expression of point mutations in the protein targets of drug inhibition. These results support the idea of using IAP inhibitors in conjunction with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition to override drug resistance and suppress or eradicate residual disease.","['Weisberg, E', 'Ray, A', 'Barrett, R', 'Nelson, E', 'Christie, A L', 'Porter, D', 'Straub, C', 'Zawel, L', 'Daley, J F', 'Lazo-Kallanian, S', 'Stone, R', 'Galinsky, I', 'Frank, D', 'Kung, A L', 'Griffin, J D']","['Weisberg E', 'Ray A', 'Barrett R', 'Nelson E', 'Christie AL', 'Porter D', 'Straub C', 'Zawel L', 'Daley JF', 'Lazo-Kallanian S', 'Stone R', 'Galinsky I', 'Frank D', 'Kung AL', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

No study has presently documented a role of insulin as a myeloma growth factor (MGF) for human multiple myeloma cells (MMCs), whereas many studies have concluded that IGF-1 is a major MGF. IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is aberrantly expressed by MMCs in association with a poor prognosis. In this study we show that insulin receptor (INSR) is increased throughout normal plasma cell differentiation. INSR gene is also expressed by MMCs of 203/206 newly diagnosed patients. Insulin is an MGF as potent as IGF-1 at physiological concentrations and requires the presence of insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors, stimulating INSR(+)IGF-1R(+) MMCs, unlike INSR(+)IGF-1R(-) or INSR(-)IGF-1R(-) MMCs. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that INSR is linked with IGF-1R in MMCs and that insulin induces both IGF-1R and INSR phosphorylations and vice versa. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that insulin is an MGF as potent as IGF-1 at physiological concentrations and its activity necessitates insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptor activation. Further therapeutic strategies targeting the IGF/IGF-1R pathway have to take into account neutralizing the IGF-1R-mediated insulin MGF activity.","['Sprynski, A C', 'Hose, D', 'Kassambara, A', 'Vincent, L', 'Jourdan, M', 'Rossi, J F', 'Goldschmidt, H', 'Klein, B']","['Sprynski AC', 'Hose D', 'Kassambara A', 'Vincent L', 'Jourdan M', 'Rossi JF', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Klein B']","['INSERM, U847, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/immunology/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Receptor, Insulin/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2010/09/17 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010192 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.192 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1940-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.192.

Alemtuzumab (ALM) and rituximab (RTX) are therapeutic antibodies directed against CD52 and CD20, respectively, but showed limited activity against ALL in clinical trials. The mechanisms for the impaired responses remained unclear. We studied expression of CD52 and CD20 on ALL cells and found that most cases coexpressed CD52 and CD20. However, distinct CD52-negative (CD52(-)) subpopulations were detected in most cases as the result of defective glycophosphatidyl-inositol anchoring. Although ALM efficiently eradicated CD52-positive (CD52(+)) cells in NOD/scid mice engrafted with primary human ALL, CD52(-) subclones escaped therapy. In the same model, RTX showed limited activity resulting from occurrence of CD20 down-modulation. However, CD52(-) cells concurrently lacked the glycophosphatidyl-inositol-anchored complement regulators CD55 and CD59 and showed increased susceptibility to RTX-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. At the same time, ALM was shown to inhibit down-modulation of CD20 in response to RTX by depleting the trogocytic capacity of phagocytic cells. Probably because of these complementary mechanisms, combined administration of ALM and RTX induced complete responses in vivo. Based on these data, we propose a mechanistic rationale for combined application of RTX and ALM in ALL.","['Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'van Schie, Marianke L J', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Willemze, Roelof', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Nijmeijer BA', 'van Schie ML', 'Halkes CJ', 'Griffioen M', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. nijmeijerbart@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100915,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD52 Antigen', 'CD59 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34797-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-262006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 23;116(26):5930-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-262006.

We screened rodents and other mammals for sequence variation in the Xpr1 receptor for the mouse xenotropic or polytropic mouse leukemia viruses (X-MLVs or P-MLVs, respectively) of the gammaretrovirus family and for susceptibility to mouse-derived X/P-MLVs and to XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus), an X-MLV-like virus isolated from humans with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. We identified multiple distinct susceptibility phenotypes; these include the four known Xpr1 variants in Mus and a novel fifth Xpr1 gene found in Mus molossinus and Mus musculus. We describe the geographic and species distribution of the Mus Xpr1 variants but failed to find the X-MLV-restrictive laboratory mouse allele in any wild mouse. We used mutagenesis and phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the functional contributions made by constrained, variable, and deleted residues. Rodent Xpr1 is under positive selection, indicating a history of host-pathogen conflicts; several codons under selection have known roles in virus entry. All non-Mus mammals are susceptible to mouse X-MLVs, but some restrict other members of the X/P-MLV family, and the resistance of hamster and gerbil cells to XMRV indicates that XMRV has unique receptor requirements. We show that the hypervariable fourth extracellular XPR1 loop (ECL4) contains three evolutionarily constrained residues that do not contribute to receptor function, we identify two novel residues important for virus entry (I579 and T583), and we describe a unique pattern of ECL4 variation in the three virus-restrictive Xpr1 variants found in MLV-infected house mice; these mice carry different deletions in ECL4, suggesting either that these sites or loop size affects receptor function.","['Yan, Yuhe', 'Liu, Qingping', 'Wollenberg, Kurt', 'Martin, Carrie', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Yan Y', 'Liu Q', 'Wollenberg K', 'Martin C', 'Buckler-White A', 'Kozak CA']","['NIH, NIAID, LMM, Bldg. 4, Room 329, 4 Center Drive MSC 0460, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460. ckozak@niaid.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100915,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gammaretrovirus/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', '*Genetic Variation', 'Goats', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Mammals/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/metabolism/*veterinary/virology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2010/09/17 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01549-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01549-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Nov;84(22):11970-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01549-10.

Four bis(oxy)bis-urea and bis(sulfanediyl)bis-urea derivatives (4a, 4b, 8, 11a) predicted as active by this model, together with 11b predicted to be of low activity, were synthesized and screened for anti-tumor activity utilizing 55 different tumor cell lines. Compounds 8 and 11a showed anti-tumor properties against most of the adopted cell lines with growth inhibition exceeding 50%. The highly promising preliminary anti-tumor properties of compounds 8 and 11a, were screened at serial dilutions (10(-4)-10(-8) muM) for determination of their GI(50) and TGI against the screened human tumor cell lines. Compound 11a (GI(50) = 1.55, TGI = 8.68 muM) is more effective than compound 8 (GI(50)=58.30, TGI = > 100 muM) against the target leukemia RPMI-8226 cell line. Compound 11a also exhibits highly pronounced anti-tumor properties against NCI-H226, NCI-H23 (non-small cell lung cancer), COLO 205 (colon cancer), SNB-75 (CNS cancer), OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3 (ovarian cancer), A498 (renal cancer) MDA-MB-231/ATCC and MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer) cell lines (GI(50) = 1.95, 1.61, 1.38, 1.56, 1.30, 1.98, 1.18, 1.85, 1.08, TGI = 8.35, 6.01, 2.67, 8.59, 4.01, 7.01, 5.62, 6.38, 5.63 muM, respectively). Thus 11a could be a suitable lead towards the design of broad spectrum anti-tumor active agents targeting various human tumor cell lines.","['Katritzky, Alan R', 'Girgis, Adel S', 'Slavov, Svetoslav', 'Tala, Srinivasa R', 'Stoyanova-Slavova, Iva']","['Katritzky AR', 'Girgis AS', 'Slavov S', 'Tala SR', 'Stoyanova-Slavova I']","['Center for Heterocyclic Compounds, University of Florida, Department of Chemistry, Gainesville, FL 32611-7200, United States. katritzky@chem.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100819,France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Static Electricity']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0223-5234(10)00611-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2010.08.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2010 Nov;45(11):5183-99. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2010.08.033.

In addition to improving survival, the comprehensive care of children with cancer must offer total care including special emphasis on pain management and psychosocial support by a multidisciplinary team. Pain considerations in children are unique and differ from those in adults. For example, bone pain is often one of the presenting symptoms of leukemia in children, but can be mistaken for growing pain or labeled psychological. Bone pain is also a prominent symptom in late stage neuroblastoma, and of course in bone tumors. The American Medical Association and National Cancer Institute promote the absence of pain as a patient right and a marker of good clinical care and a quality of care issue. Pain due to disease burden responds dramatically to chemotherapy and the uninitiated are often surprised by the sudden increase in activity and playfulness of children undergoing induction chemotherapy.

The objective of the registry is to establish a reliable magnitude of cancer in the area covered and the first report was published in 2003. The present article describes data from the second report of cancer incidence over a five year period (2002-2006). Internationally accepted standardized cancer registration methodologies described by IACR and IARC were used. CanReg-4 using ICDO-3 and ICD-10 were applied in the data processing and analysis. Results showed no difference in the overall incidence between the males and females (ratio was 0.83:1) and age standardized rate s(ASR) per 100,000 inhabitants were 30.2 and 31.1. The five most common cancers were breast cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NH lymphoma), brain cancer and Hodgkin's disease (16.6%, 12.6%, 7.8%, 5.2% and 4.4%, respectively). Among males, leukemia was the first followed by NH lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, brain and liver. In females, breast was the first, then leukemia, NH lymphoma, thyroid and brain cancer. The highest ASR for males (145 per 100,00 inhabitants) was observed at age 70-74 years whereas for females, two peaks (each 105 per 100,000 inhabitants) were equally noticed at age 60-64 and 70-74 years. Generally, females showed equal or higher incidence compared to males until age 55-59 where males reported higher incidence. The overall pattern of cancer incidence in this report is not much different from that in the previous report. Furthermore, the report generally indicates that the pattern of the most common registered cancer bears some similarities with the adjacent Gulf Cooperation Council States with which we share many characteristics, despite differences that warrant further investigation.","['Ba Saleem, Huda Omer', 'Bawazir, Amin Ahmed', 'Moore, Malcolm', 'Al-Sakkaf, Khaled Abdulla']","['Ba Saleem HO', 'Bawazir AA', 'Moore M', 'Al-Sakkaf KA']","['Aden Cancer Center, Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Aden University, Khormaksar, Aden, Yemen. hudabasaleem92@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Yemen/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2010;11(2):507-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It catalyses the detoxification of base propanols that arise from DNA oxidation thus offering cellular protection against oxidative stress. A single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 105 results in the substitution of isoleucine (Ile) to valine (Val) causing a metabolically less active variant of the enzyme. We here assessed the impact of the GSTP1 codon 105 polymorphism in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) development and therapy response. The Ile105Val polymorphism was analyzed using a PCR-RFLP technique. Two hundred and sixty patients with CML and 248 healthy, age and sex matched controls were included in the study of associations with patient characteristics and treatment outcome. The GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was significantly associated with CML development (?2 = 9.57; df = 2; p = 0.0084). With respect to clinical phase, CML patients in advanced phase (accelerated and blast crisis) had higher frequency of heterozygous (Ile/Val) genotype (47.62%) compared to chronic phase (36.5%). Further 54.5% of patients in blast crisis carried valine allele as compared to those in chronic phase (36.5%). The frequency of combined genotypes (Ile/Val, Val/Val) was elevated in cytogenetic poor (41.6%) and minor (53.57%) responders as compared to major (38.51%) responders. Hence the present study suggests that GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism with reduced GSTP1 enzyme activity might influence CML development, progression and response rates.","['Sailaja, Kagita', 'Surekha, D', 'Rao, D Nageswara', 'Rao, D Raghunadha', 'Vishnupriya, S']","['Sailaja K', 'Surekha D', 'Rao DN', 'Rao DR', 'Vishnupriya S']","['Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/17 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2010/09/17 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2010;11(2):461-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although very rare, some inherited DNA repair insufficiency syndromes (e.g., Fanconi anemia, Bloom's syndrome) have added substantially to our understanding of crucial mechanisms of leukemogenesis in recent years. Conversely, sporadic leukemias account for the main proportion of leukemias and here DNA damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role. Although the exact mechanisms of increased ROS production remain largely unknown and no single pathway has been detected thus far, some oncogenic proteins (e.g., the activated tyrosine kinases BCR-ABL1 and FLT3-ITD) seem to play a key role in driving genetic instability by increased ROS generation which influences the disease course (e.g., blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia or relapse in FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia). Of course other mechanisms, which promote genetic instability in leukemia also exist. A newly emerging mechanism is the genome-wide alteration of epigenetic marks (e.g., hypomethylation of histone H3K79), which promotes chromosomal instability. Taken together genetic instability plays a critical role both in inherited and sporadic leukemias and emerges as a common theme in both inherited and sporadic leukemias. Beyond its theoretical impact, the analysis of genetic instability may lead the way to the development of innovative therapy strategies.","['Popp, Henning D', 'Bohlander, Stefan K']","['Popp HD', 'Bohlander SK']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory of Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University-Campus Grosshadern, Marchioninistrasse 15, Munich, Germany.

Arsenic is a potent endocrine disruptor, including of the estrogen receptor. It was recently shown that environmental estrogen-receptor disruptors can affect the signaling of mast cells, which are important players in parasite defense, asthma and allergy. Antigen (Ag) or allergen crosslinking of IgE-bound receptors on mast cells leads to signaling, culminating in degranulation, the release of histamine and other mediators. Because As is an endocrine disruptor and because endocrine disruptors have been found to affect degranulation, here we have tested whether sodium arsenite affects degranulation. Using the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cell model, we have measured degranulation in a fluorescence assay. Arsenic alone had no effect on basal levels of degranulation. However, As strongly inhibited Ag-stimulated degranulation at environmentally relevant concentrations, in a manner that is very dependent on concentrations of both As and Ag. The concentrations of As effective at inhibiting degranulation were not cytotoxic. This inhibition may be a mechanism underlying the traditional Chinese medicinal use of As to treat asthma. These data indicate that As may inhibit the ability of humans to fight off parasitic disease.","['Hutchinson, Lee M', 'Trinh, Benett M', 'Palmer, Rachel K', 'Preziosi, Christopher A', 'Pelletier, Jonathan H', 'Nelson, Hannah M', 'Gosse, Julie A']","['Hutchinson LM', 'Trinh BM', 'Palmer RK', 'Preziosi CA', 'Pelletier JH', 'Nelson HM', 'Gosse JA']","['Department of Molecular & Biomedical Sciences, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100914,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Endocrine Disruptors)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Sodium Compounds/*toxicity', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism']",2010/09/16 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jat.1585 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2011 Apr;31(3):231-41. doi: 10.1002/jat.1585.

However, since the specific mechanism behind this process remains largely unknown, it is difficult to extrapolate carcinogenic effects at acute high-dose exposures to risk estimates for the chronic low-dose exposures that are important for radiation protection purposes. Recently, it has become clear that the induction of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CBA/H mice takes place through two key steps, both involving the Sfpi1 gene. A similar mechanism may play a role in human radiation-induced AML. In the present paper, a two-mutation carcinogenesis model is applied to model AML in several data sets of X-ray- and neutron-exposed CBA/H mice. The models obtained provide good fits to the data. A comparison between the predictions for neutron-induced and X-ray-induced AML yields an RBE for neutrons of approximately 3. The model used is considered to be a first step toward a model for human radiation-induced AML, which could be used to estimate risks of exposure to low doses.","['Dekkers, Fieke', 'Bijwaard, Harmen', 'Bouffler, Simon', 'Ellender, Michele', 'Huiskamp, Rene', 'Kowalczuk, Christine', 'Meijne, Emmy', 'Sutmuller, Marjolein']","['Dekkers F', 'Bijwaard H', 'Bouffler S', 'Ellender M', 'Huiskamp R', 'Kowalczuk C', 'Meijne E', 'Sutmuller M']","['Laboratory of Radiation Research, Bilthoven, The Netherlands. fieke.dekkers@rivm.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100915,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation/*radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Neutrons/adverse effects', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Stochastic Processes']",2010/09/16 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-010-0328-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2011 Mar;50(1):37-45. doi: 10.1007/s00411-010-0328-7.

Cytoreductive agents, which were hitherto the mainstay of treatment, neither induce cytogenetic nor haematologic remission. Alphainterferon (a-IFN), an endogenous glycoprotein with cytotoxic and natural killer cell enhancer effects has been found to induce haematologic and cytogenetic remission in patients with CML, but neuro-psychiatric complications of a -interferon (a-IFN) usage were not reported in Nigeria. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of deliberate self-harm in University Lecturer as a side effect of a-IFN in the treatment of CML METHOD: Clinical and laboratory follow up of a patient receiving a-IFN in the management of CML from the time of diagnosis of CML to the point of loss of contact.

In October 2009, we published the first direct isolation of infectious XMRV from humans and the detection of infectious XMRV in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. In that study, a combination of classic retroviral methods were used including: DNA polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for gag and env, full length genomic sequencing, immunoblotting for viral protein expression in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, passage of infectious virus in both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to indicator cell lines, and detection of antibodies to XMRV in plasma. A combination of these methods has since allowed us to confirm infection by XMRV in 85% of the 101 patients that were originally studied. Since 2009, seven studies, predominantly using DNA polymerase chain reaction of blood products or tumor tissue, have reported failures to detect XMRV infection in patients with either prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome. A review of the current literature on XMRV supports the importance of applying multiple independent techniques in order to determine the presence of this virus. Detection methods based upon the biological and molecular amplification of XMRV, which is usually present at low levels in unstimulated blood cells and plasma, are more sensitive than assays for the virus by DNA polymerase chain reaction of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. When we examined patient blood samples that had originally tested negative by DNA polymerase chain reaction by more sensitive methods, we observed that they were infected with XMRV; thus, the DNA polymerase chain reaction tests provided false negative results. Therefore, we conclude that molecular analyses using DNA from unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or from whole blood are not yet sufficient as stand-alone assays for the identification of XMRV-infected individuals. Complementary methods are reviewed, that if rigorously followed, will likely show a more accurate snapshot of the actual distribution of XMRV infection in humans.","['Mikovits, Judy A', 'Huang, Ying', 'Pfost, Max A', 'Lombardi, Vincent C', 'Bertolette, Daniel C', 'Hagen, Kathryn S', 'Ruscetti, Francis W']","['Mikovits JA', 'Huang Y', 'Pfost MA', 'Lombardi VC', 'Bertolette DC', 'Hagen KS', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Whittemore-Peterson Institute for Neuroimmune Diseases, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA. judym@wpinstitute.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Spain,AIDS Rev,AIDS reviews,101134876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/genetics/*virology', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, gag', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/virology']",2010/09/16 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,AIDS Rev. 2010 Jul-Sep;12(3):149-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, EVI1 interactions with key proteins in hematopoiesis have been previously described, the precise role of this transcription factor in promoting leukaemic transformation is not completely understood. Recent works have identified specific microRNA (miRNA) signatures in different AML subgroups. However, there is no analysis of miRNAs profiles associated with EVI1 overexpression in humans. METHODS: We performed QT-RT-PCR to assess the expression of 250 miRNAs in cell lines with or without EVI1 overexpression and in patient samples. We used ChIP assays to evaluated the possible binding of EVI1 binding to the putative miRNA promoter. Proliferation of the different cell lines transfected with the anti- or pre-miRs was quantified by MTT. RESULTS: Our data showed that EVI1 expression was significantly correlated with the expression of miR-1-2 and miR-133-a-1 in established cell lines and in patient samples. ChIP assays confirmed that EVI1 binds directly to the promoter of these two miRNAs. However, only miR-1-2 was involved in abnormal proliferation in EVI1 expressing cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that EVI1 controls proliferation in AML through modulation of miR-1-2. This study contributes to further understand the transcriptional networks involving transcription factors and miRNAs in AML.","['Gomez-Benito, M', 'Conchillo, A', 'Garcia, M A', 'Vazquez, I', 'Maicas, M', 'Vicente, C', 'Cristobal, I', 'Marcotegui, N', 'Garcia-Orti, L', 'Bandres, E', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Alonso, M M', 'Odero, M D']","['Gomez-Benito M', 'Conchillo A', 'Garcia MA', 'Vazquez I', 'Maicas M', 'Vicente C', 'Cristobal I', 'Marcotegui N', 'Garcia-Orti L', 'Bandres E', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Alonso MM', 'Odero MD']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Navarra, Pamplona 31008, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100914,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MIRN1-2 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN133 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/09/16 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['6605874 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605874 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Oct 12;103(8):1292-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605874.

In the effort to reverse resistance to VSV-mediated oncolysis, we combined VSV with obatoclax (GX15-070)-a small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor currently in phase 2 clinical trials-and examined the molecular mechanisms governing the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficiency of combining the two agents. In combination with VSV, obatoclax synergistically induced cell death in primary CLL samples and reduced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice-bearing A20 lymphoma tumors. Mechanistically, the combination stimulated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as reflected by caspase-3 and -9 cleavage, cytochrome c release and BAX translocation. Combination treatment triggered the release of BAX from BCL-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) from BAK, whereas VSV infection induced NOXA expression and increased the formation of a novel BAX-NOXA heterodimer. Finally, NOXA was identified as an important inducer of VSV-obatoclax driven apoptosis via knockdown and overexpression of NOXA. These studies offer insight into the synergy between small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitors such as obatoclax and VSV as a combination strategy to overcome apoptosis resistance in CLL.","['Samuel, Sara', 'Tumilasci, Vanessa F', 'Oliere, Stephanie', 'Nguyen, Thi Lien-Anh', 'Shamy, April', 'Bell, John', 'Hiscott, John']","['Samuel S', 'Tumilasci VF', 'Oliere S', 'Nguyen TL', 'Shamy A', 'Bell J', 'Hiscott J']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100914,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Vesiculovirus/physiology']",2010/09/16 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)30903-0 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2010.188 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2010 Dec;18(12):2094-103. doi: 10.1038/mt.2010.188.

We evaluated pretreatment expression of BAALC and ERG in 158 de novo patients treated on cytarabine/daunorubicin-based protocols. The patients were also characterized for other established molecular prognosticators. Low BAALC and ERG expression levels were associated with better outcome in univariable and multivariable analyses. Expression levels of both BAALC and ERG were the only factors significantly associated with overall survival upon multivariable analysis. To gain biological insights, we derived gene expression signatures associated with BAALC and ERG expression in older CN-AML patients.

In low BAALC expressers, genes associated with undifferentiated hematopoietic precursors and unfavorable outcome predictors were down-regulated, whereas HOX genes and HOX-gene-embedded microRNAs were up-regulated. Low ERG expressers presented with down-regulation of genes involved in the DNA-methylation machinery, and up-regulation of miR-148a, which targets DNMT3B. We conclude that in older CN-AML patients, low BAALC and ERG expression associates with better outcome and distinct gene and microRNA expression signatures that could aid in identifying new targets and novel therapeutic strategies for older patients.","['Schwind, Sebastian', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Holland, Kelsi B', 'Margeson, Dean', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Schwind S', 'Marcucci G', 'Maharry K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Holland KB', 'Margeson D', 'Becker H', 'Whitman SP', 'Wu YZ', 'Metzeler KH', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Carter TH', 'Moore JO', 'Baer MR', 'Carroll AJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100914,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/16 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60362-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-290536 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 16;116(25):5660-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-290536.

Expression of this structurally and functionally abnormal CD22 protein is associated with a very aggressive in vivo growth of patients' primary leukemia cells causing disseminated overt leukemia in SCID mice. The abnormal CD22 coreceptor is encoded by a profoundly aberrant mRNA arising from a splicing defect that causes the deletion of exon 12 (c.2208-c.2327) (CD22DeltaE12) and results in a truncating frameshift mutation. The splicing defect is associated with multiple homozygous mutations within a 132-bp segment of the intronic sequence between exons 12 and 13. These mutations cause marked changes in the predicted secondary structures of the mutant CD22 pre-mRNA sequences that affect the target motifs for the splicing factors hnRNP-L, PTB, and PCBP that are up-regulated in infant leukemia cells. Forced expression of the mutant CD22DeltaE12 protein in transgenic mice perturbs B-cell development, as evidenced by B-precursor/B-cell hyperplasia, and corrupts the regulation of gene expression, causing reduced expression levels of several genes with a tumor suppressor function. We further show that CD22DeltaE12-associated unique gene expression signature is a discriminating feature of newly diagnosed infant leukemia patients. These striking findings implicate CD22DeltaE12 as a previously undescribed pathogenic mechanism in human B-precursor leukemia.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Goodman, Patricia', 'Ma, Hong', 'Dibirdik, Ilker', 'Qazi, Sanjive']","['Uckun FM', 'Goodman P', 'Ma H', 'Dibirdik I', 'Qazi S']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90027-0367, USA. fmuckun@chla.usc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100914,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Exons/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA Precursors/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*genetics']",2010/09/16 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1007896107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1007896107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 28;107(39):16852-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1007896107.

In the present study, we investigated its pro-apoptosis mechanisms in leukemia HL-60 cell. Our data revealed that 3,6-dihydroxyflavone dose- and time-dependently decreases cell viability and induces apoptosis by activating caspase cascade, cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The anti-cancer effects of 3,6-dihydroxyflavone are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species, the altered glutathione-redox balance as significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) and its ratio to gluthatione disulfide (GSSG), and the accumulation of lipid peroxidation indicator malondialdehyde. Addition of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevents the elevation of reactive oxygen species induced by 3,6-dihydroxyflavone and partially suppresses the cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, 3,6-dihydroxyflavone reduces cell membrane fluidity and induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. 3,6-Dihydroxyflavone was also found to modulate the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, which includes increased protein kinase of 38 kDa (p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. The effect of 3,6-dihydroxyflavone on MAPKs pathway could be abrogated by co-treatment with NAC. Taking together, our data suggested that 3,6-dihydroxyflavone increases intracellular oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, thereby affecting the physical and functional properties of plasma membrane, as well as MAPKs signal pathway, which are likely to play a role in the 3,6-dihydroxyflavone-induced HL-60 cell cytotoxicities.","['Chang, Hui', 'Lin, Hui', 'Yi, Long', 'Zhu, Jundong', 'Zhou, Yong', 'Mi, Mantian', 'Zhang, Qianyong']","['Chang H', 'Lin H', 'Yi L', 'Zhu J', 'Zhou Y', 'Mi M', 'Zhang Q']","['Research Center for Nutrition and Food Safety, Third Military University, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Food Safety, Chongqing, 400038 China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100916,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (3,6-dihydroxyflavone)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2010/09/16 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(10)00824-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Dec 1;648(1-3):31-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.08.020.

These epigenetic processes include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, all of which play roles in neural cellular diversity, connectivity, and plasticity. Further, large-scale transcriptomic analyses have revealed that the eukaryotic genome is pervasively transcribed, forming interleaved protein-coding RNAs and regulatory nonprotein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which act through a broad array of molecular mechanisms. Most of these ncRNAs are transcribed in a cell type- and developmental stage-specific manner in the CNS. A broad array of posttranscriptional processes, such as RNA editing and transport, can modulate the functions of both protein-coding RNAs and ncRNAs. Additional studies implicate nuclear organization and dynamics in mediating epigenetic regulation. The compartmentalization of DNA sequences and other molecular machinery into functional nuclear domains, such as transcription factories, Cajal bodies, promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, nuclear speckles, and paraspeckles, some of which are found prominently in neural cells, is associated with regulation of transcriptional activity and posttranscriptional RNA processing. These observations suggest that genomic architecture and RNA biology in the CNS are much more complex and nuanced than previously appreciated. Increasing evidence now suggests that most, if not all, human CNS diseases are associated with either primary or secondary perturbations in one or more aspects of the epigenome. In this review, we provide an update of our emerging understanding of genomic architecture, RNA biology, and nuclear organization and highlight the interconnected roles that deregulation of these factors may play in diverse CNS disorders.","['Qureshi, Irfan A', 'Mehler, Mark F']","['Qureshi IA', 'Mehler MF']","['Rosyln and Leslie Goldstein Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism/pathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nervous System Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Editing/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics']",2010/09/25 06:00,2010/10/07 06:00,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS5718 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05718.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2010 Sep;1204 Suppl:E20-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05718.x.,"['R01 NS038902-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS071571/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS38902/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH066290/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS071571-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS038902/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH66290/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH066290-08/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS07157/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2946117,,,,,,['NIHMS225028'],,,,,,,,,,,,,181

Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells were used as models to study mitogen induced lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine mRNA expression (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) and intracellular protein levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (MAPK and NF-kappaB). The NO release levels, on treatment with the extract and molecule, were correlated with the underlying iNOS mRNA expression in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. RT-PCR for COX-2, MMP2 and MMP9 were also performed in the cell line. The rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 was used as an in Vitro model for PLA2 activity. Then, 20 mug/ml of Lippia nodiflora crude methanol extract and 10 mug/ml of the purified CPP were used for subsequent studies based on the IC50 values obtained in the proliferation assay. Results demonstrate that the isolated Cyclo-pentano phenanthrenol inhibits TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 expression, NO release via iNOS suppression, prostaglandin biosynthesis via PLA2 and COX-2 inhibition and the activation of intracellular targets, MAPK and NF-kappaB.

Live cervical epithelial cells were isolated from endocervical cells and induction was done with chlamydial EBs.

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is produced and released from muscle cells in vitro and from intact skeletal muscle in vivo. During exercise, skeletal muscle potently up-regulates LIF mRNA expression, likely due to oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations.

The murine disease is linked to a genetic abnormality in microRNA mir-15a/16-1 locus, resulting in decreased mature miR-15a/16. METHODS: Spleens of aging NZB were analyzed for the presence of B-1 cells via flow cytometry and for the presence of a side population (SP) via the ability of cells to exclude Hoechst 33342 dye. The SP was assayed for the presence of hyperdiploid B-1 clones and for the ability to differentiate into B-1 cells in vitro and transfer disease in vivo. In addition, enhanced apoptosis of chemoresistant NZB B-1 cells was examined by restoring miR-16 levels in nutlin-treated cells. RESULTS: Aging NZB mice develop a B-1 expansion and clonal development that evolves from MBL into CLL. An expansion in SP is also seen. Although the SP did contain increased cells with stem cell markers, they lacked malignant B-1 cells and did not transfer disease in vivo. Similar to B-1 cells, splenic NZB SP also has decreased miR-15a/16 when compared with C57Bl/6. Exogenous addition of miR-15a/16 to NZB B-1 cells resulted in increased sensitivity to nutlin. CONCLUSION: NZB serve as an excellent model for studying the development and progression of age-associated CLL. NZB SP cells do not seem to contain cancer stem cells, but rather the B-1 stem cell. NZB B-1 chemoresistance may be related to reduced miR-15a/16 expression.","['Salerno, Erica', 'Yuan, Yao', 'Scaglione, Brian J', 'Marti, Gerald', 'Jankovic, Alexander', 'Mazzella, Fermina', 'Laurindo, Maria Fernanda', 'Despres, Daryl', 'Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Rader, Christoph', 'Raveche, Elizabeth']","['Salerno E', 'Yuan Y', 'Scaglione BJ', 'Marti G', 'Jankovic A', 'Mazzella F', 'Laurindo MF', 'Despres D', 'Baskar S', 'Rader C', 'Raveche E']","['Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry/New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Both WM and CLL have associated precursor conditions: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) of immunoglobulin M (IgM) type and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), respectively. Recently, a case of MBL with an IgM MGUS was reported, suggesting a close biological relationship between these entities. While much is known about MGUS overall, investigations of IgM MGUS specifically have been fragmentary. METHODS: In this article, we review data on the prevalence, clinical aspects and natural history of IgM MGUS, and focus on identifying gaps in our understanding of the complex relationships among B-cell malignancies and their precursors. RESULTS: There appears to be marked heterogeneity in the prevalence of IgM MGUS across populations. However, studies have varied in definition, design, laboratory methods, and endpoints. IgM MGUS differs from non-IgM MGUS in certain respects, including prevalence across racial groups, rate of progression, and pattern of malignant outcomes. There are limited data regarding the coincident occurrence of IgM MGUS and MBL. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies incorporating both protein electrophoresis and flow cytometry are needed to define the underlying spectrum and causes of precursor development, risk factors for progression, and markers that distinguish low- and high-risk precursor patients.","['McMaster, Mary L', 'Landgren, Ola']","['McMaster ML', 'Landgren O']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7236, USA.

B cell clonal expansions are also associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and they can evolve into lymphoproliferative disorders such as mixed cryoglobulinemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The relationship between MBL and HCV infection has not been established yet. METHODS: By five-colour flow cytometry, we analyzed 123 HCV positive subjects with diagnosis of chronic hepatitis (94) or cirrhosis (29); 16 of those with cirrhosis had a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. RESULTS: MBL were identified in 35/123 (28.5%), at significantly higher frequency than in the general population. Sixteen/thirty-five were atypical-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) MBL (CD5(+), CD20(bright)), 13/35 were CLL-like MBL (CD5(bright), CD20(dim)), and 6/35 were CD5(-) MBL. Twenty-four/ninety-four (25.5%) patients affected by chronic hepatitis had MBL, whereas 11/29 (37.9%) patients with cirrhosis showed a B cell clone. A biased usage of IGHVgenes similar to HCV-associated NHL was evident. CONCLUSIONS: All three types of MBL can be identified in HCV-infected individuals at a higher frequency than in the general population, and their presence appears to correlate with a more advanced disease stage. The phenotypic heterogeneity is reminiscent of the diversity of NHL arising in the context of HCV infection. The persistence of HCV may be responsible for the dysregulation of the immune system and in particular of the B cell compartment.","['Fazi, Claudia', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Cottini, Francesca', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Finazzi, Renato', 'Memoli, Massimo', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Fazi C', 'Dagklis A', 'Cottini F', 'Scarfo L', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Finazzi R', 'Memoli M', 'Ghia P']","['Laboratory of B cell Neoplasia, Division of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: Six color flow cytometry was performed on CLL-type MBL (n = 94) and CLL (n = 387) at diagnosis or relapse; 39 cases had poor-risk chromosomal abnormalities (17p and/or 11q deletion). Expression of 30 markers was analysed: CCR6, CD10, CD103, CD11c, CD138, CD200, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD25, CD27, CD31, CD38, CD39, CD43, CD49d, CD5, CD52, CD62L, CD63, CD79b, CD81, CD86, CD95, CXCR5, HLADR, IgD, IgG, IgM, LAIR1. RESULTS: There was no difference in expression between CLL-type MBL and CLL for the majority of markers. Differential expression was observed for several markers, mainly between MBL and CLL cases with adverse-risk chromosomal abnormalities. These differences included lower expression of CD38 (9.4-fold lower, P = 0.007) and CD49d (3.2-fold lower, P = 0.008) and higher expression of LAIR-1 (3.7-fold higher, P = 0.003), CXCR5 (1.25-fold higher, P = 0.002), and CCR6 (1.9-fold higher P < 0.001) on CLL-type MBL compared to CLL with adverse chromosomal abnormalities. CD62L (L-selectin) which mediates lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial venules of lymphoid tissue, was expressed at a significantly different level between CLL-type MBL and both CLL sub-groups, with 1.3-fold lower (P = 0.04) expression levels on the MBL cases. However, there was broad overlap in expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: CLL-type MBL is phenotypically identical to CLL for a very broad range of markers. Differential expression is predominantly related to known prognostic markers and proteins involved in homing to lymphoid tissue.","['Rawstron, Andy C', 'Shingles, Jane', 'de Tute, Ruth', 'Bennett, Fiona', 'Jack, Andrew S', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Rawstron AC', 'Shingles J', 'de Tute R', 'Bennett F', 'Jack AS', 'Hillmen P']","[""HMDS, St. James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@nhs.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

MBL can be the precursor of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It may be associated with an autoimmune abnormality or be related to aging (immunosenescence). The combination of available new fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody reagents, multilaser instrumentation, and improved software tools have led to a new level of multicolor analysis of MBL. Presently, several centers, including the University of Salamanca (Spain), Duke University (Durham, NC), Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), and the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD) in conjunction with the Genetics and Epidemiology of Familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia Consortium, the Food and Drug Administration (Bethesda, MD), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (Atlanta, GA) in collaboration with Saint Luke's Hospital (Kansas City, MO), the Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan (Italy), and Leeds Teaching Hospital (UK) are all actively conducting studies on MBL. This commentary is an updated summary of the current methods used in these centers. It is important to note the diversity of use in reagents, instruments, and methods of analysis. Despite this diversity, there is a consensus in what constitutes the diagnosis of MBL and its subtypes. There is also an emerging consensus on what the next investigative steps should be.","['Nieto, Wendy G', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Teodosio, Cristina', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Allgood, Sallie D', 'Connors, Fiona', 'Rachel, Jane M', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Rawstron, Andy C', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Hanson, Curt A', 'Shim, Youn K', 'Vogt, Robert F', 'Marti, Gerald E']","['Nieto WG', 'Almeida J', 'Teodosio C', 'Abbasi F', 'Allgood SD', 'Connors F', 'Rachel JM', 'Ghia P', 'Lanasa MC', 'Rawstron AC', 'Orfao A', 'Caporaso NE', 'Hanson CA', 'Shim YK', 'Vogt RF', 'Marti GE']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer/IBMCC (CSIC-USAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In most cases, MBL cells show similar phenotypic/genetic features to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells-CLL-like MBL-but little is known about non-CLL-like MBL. METHODS: PB samples from 639 healthy individuals (46% men/54% women) >40 years old (62 +/- 13 years) with normal lymphocyte counts (2.1 +/- 0.7 x 10(9)/L) were immunophenotyped using high-sensitive flow cytometry, based on 8-color stainings and the screening for >5 x 10(6) total PB leukocytes. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects (2.0%; 9 males/4 females, aged 73 +/- 10 years; absolute lymphocyte count: 2.4 +/- 0.8 x 10(9)/L) showed a non-CLL-like clonal B-cell population, whose frequency clearly increased with age: 0.4%, 3%, and 5.4% of subjects aged 40-59, 60-79, and >/=80 years, respectively. One single B-cell clone was detected in 9/13 cases, while two B-cell clones were found in 4/13 (n = 17 MBL populations). Nine MBL cell populations showed a CD5(-) phenotype (usually overlapping with marginal zone-derived (MZL) or lymphoplasmacytic (LPL) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) B-cells, or an unclassifiable NHL), but CD5(-/+d) (n = 3) and CD5(+) (n = 3 non-CLL-like MBL, consistent with a mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL)-like phenotype, and n = 2 CLL-like) MBL were also identified; iFISH supported the diagnosis in most cases. No preferential IGHV usage of B-cell receptor could be found. Twelve cases reevaluated at month +12 showed circulating clonal B-cells, at mean levels significantly higher than those initially detected. CONCLUSIONS: Non-CLL-like MBL cases frequently show biclonality, in association with MZL-, LPL-, MCL-like, or unclassifiable phenotypic profiles. As with CLL-like MBL, the frequency of non-CLL-like MBL increases with age, with a clear predominance of males.","['Nieto, Wendy G', 'Teodosio, Cristina', 'Lopez, Antonio', 'Rodriguez-Caballero, Arancha', 'Romero, Alfonso', 'Barcena, Paloma', 'Gutierrez, Maria Laura', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Paulino', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Almeida, Julia']","['Nieto WG', 'Teodosio C', 'Lopez A', 'Rodriguez-Caballero A', 'Romero A', 'Barcena P', 'Gutierrez ML', 'Langerak AW', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Orfao A', 'Almeida J']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer/IBMCC (CSIC-USAL), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

This review investigates associations between biology and disease activity as they relate to the absolute numbers of abnormal cells. The clonal B-cells in CLL-type MBL are indistinguishable from CLL with respect to surface phenotype and the presence of chromosomal abnormalities. However, the majority of CLL-type MBL cases in the general population have very low numbers of clonal B-cells, typically in the range 0.1-10 per muL, and such cases use different IGHV genes than higher-count CLL-type MBL cases and often show intraclonal heterogeneity. Cases with higher counts are biologically similar to CLL although there is a relationship between the CLL cell count at presentation and the likelihood of further clonal expansion. Individuals presenting with CLL cell counts above 2,000 per muL are more likely to have gradually increasing B-cell counts over time and although the risk of requiring treatment for progressive CLL remains low there may be impaired normal B-cell activity.","['Rawstron, Andy C', 'Shanafelt, Tait', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Hanson, Curtis', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Rawstron AC', 'Shanafelt T', 'Lanasa MC', 'Landgren O', 'Hanson C', 'Orfao A', 'Hillmen P', 'Ghia P']","[""HMDS, Department of Hematology, St. James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

MBL and its relationship with CLL have been actively investigated over the last decade. This report systematically reviews the prevalence of MBL in the context of the populations studied and the evolution of laboratory methods used to define MBL. METHODS: To identify published studies that have assessed the prevalence of MBL, we systematically searched the MEDLINE databases and consulted with members of the International MBL Study Group. We reviewed the 10 articles that were identified by this process. We abstracted information on study populations, laboratory tests, criteria for designating MBL, and the reported frequencies. RESULTS: Three of the ten studies were published in 2009, three between 2007 and 2008, and four between 2002 and 2004. Reported prevalences varied widely, ranging from 0.12 to 18.2%. This variability was clearly associated with both the laboratory methods and the populations studied. MBL was more common among older individuals and kindred of persons with CLL. The most common MBL subtype was CLL-like MBL. CONCLUSIONS: Large population-based studies of MBL that employ standardized laboratory methods with a consensus case definition are needed to assess prevalence and establish risk factors. These studies should include prospective follow-up of MBL cases to determine the relationship between MBL and CLL. Data from original studies should be reported in sufficient detail to allow future synthesis of information from multiple studies, such as meta-analysis.","['Shim, Youn K', 'Middleton, Dannie C', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Rachel, Jane M', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Raveche, Elizabeth S', 'Rawstron, Andy C', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Marti, Gerald E', 'Vogt, Robert F']","['Shim YK', 'Middleton DC', 'Caporaso NE', 'Rachel JM', 'Landgren O', 'Abbasi F', 'Raveche ES', 'Rawstron AC', 'Orfao A', 'Marti GE', 'Vogt RF']","['Division of Health Studies, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. yshim@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Several methods exist for this type of work, some of which are described elsewhere in this volume. In this chapter we will describe the use of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). These chemical tags attach to all peptides in a protein digest via free amines at the peptide N-terminus and on the side chain of lysine residues. Labelled samples are then pooled and analysed simultaneously. Since the tags are isobaric, labelled peptides do not show a mass shift in MS, instead signal from the same peptide from all samples is summed, providing a moderate increase in sensitivity. Upon peptide fragmentation, sequence ions (b- and y-type) also show this summed intensity which aids sensitivity. However, the distribution of isotopes in the different tags is such that when the tags fragment a tag-specific 'reporter' ion is released. The ratio of signal intensities from these tags acts as an indication of the relative proportions of that peptide between the different labelled samples. This chapter will describe the procedure for labelling and analysing peptide/protein samples using iTRAQ.","['Unwin, Richard D']",['Unwin RD'],"['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Analytic Sample Preparation Methods', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Proteins/*analysis/*chemistry', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/12/29 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-780-8_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;658:205-15. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-780-8_12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the possibility of using a radiofluorinated AraG as an imaging agent, we have synthesized 2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine ([(18)F]F-AraG) and investigated its uptake in T cells. PROCEDURE: We have synthesized [(18)F]F-AraG via a direct fluorination of 2-N-acetyl-6-O-((4-nitrophenyl)ethyl)-9-(3',5'-di-O-trityl-2'-O-trifyl-beta-D-rib ofuranosyl)guanine with [(18)F]KF/K.2.2.2 in DMSO at 85 degrees C for 45 min. [(18)F]F-AraG uptake in both a CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line (unactivated) and activated primary thymocytes was evaluated. RESULTS: We have successfully prepared [(18)F]F-AraG in 7-10% radiochemical yield (decay corrected) with a specific activity of 0.8-1.3 Ci/mumol. Preliminary cell uptake experiments showed that both a CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line and activated primary thymocytes take up the [(18)F]F-AraG. CONCLUSION: For the first time to the best of our knowledge, [(18)F]F-AraG has been successfully synthesized by direct fluorination of an appropriate precursor of a guanosine nucleoside. This approach maybe also useful for the synthesis of other important positron emission tomography (PET) probes such as [(18)F]FEAU, [(18)F]FMAU, and [(18)F]FBAU which are currently synthesized by multiple steps and involve lengthy purification. The cell uptake studies support future studies to investigate the use of [(18)F]F-AraG as a PET imaging agent of T cells.","['Namavari, Mohammad', 'Chang, Ya-Fang', 'Kusler, Brenda', 'Yaghoubi, Shahriar', 'Mitchell, Beverly S', 'Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam']","['Namavari M', 'Chang YF', 'Kusler B', 'Yaghoubi S', 'Mitchell BS', 'Gambhir SS']","['Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS), Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Mol Imaging Biol,Molecular imaging and biology,101125610,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)']",IM,"['Arabinonucleosides/*chemical synthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Positron-Emission Tomography', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2010/09/15 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11307-010-0414-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Imaging Biol. 2011 Oct;13(5):812-8. doi: 10.1007/s11307-010-0414-x.,['P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient is a young Jehovah's Witness suffering myeloid leukaemia who is being treated in a Catholic cancer hospital where the practice of blood transfusion forms part of the standard protocol to treat the disease. The consultations under analysis take place in a Chilean cancer clinic where mainly the oncologist and a Jehovah's Witness Representative (JWR) present discuss and negotiate expert information on the substitute methods to be used. The exchange dynamics of the consultations differ from the usual visits where the medical knowledge and expertise is primarily in the hands of the medical practitioner. In these encounters, the JWR shares vital information with the oncologist providing the basis of the treatment to be used. This shifting of the balance of power-which could have been a cause of tension in the visit and a contributing factor in the disruption of communication-has instead brought light to the encounter where the negotiated treatment has been achieved with relative ease. The patient's future is in the hands of the oncologist and the JWR, and their successful negotiation of treatment has made it possible to cater for the particular needs of a JW patient. Sharing different medical practices has not been an obstacle, but an opportunity to find out ways to deliver equity access and well-informed practices to a non-conventional patient.","['Cordella, Marisa']",['Cordella M'],"['School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics, Faculty of Arts Monash University, Building 11, Clayton Campus, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia.

The new probe tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) carboxylate salt (TTF-(COONBu(4))(2), ditetrabutylammonium salt for propylenedithio-4',5'-tetrathiafulvalene-4,5-dicarboxylate), which has specific spectral and electrochemical properties, has been synthesized and assembled with carbon nanotubes to form a new type of nanocomposite. A simple method of fabricating the beta-CD/MWCNT modified electrodes based on functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) has been explored by using glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs), which could remarkably enhance the sensitivity of the biomolecular detection. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the new probe TTF-(COONBu(4))(2) with beta-CD/MWCNT modified electrodes could be readily utilized to sensitively detect cancer cells such as liver cancer cells SMMC-7721 and HepG2, drug sensitive leukemia K562/B.W cells and drug resistant leukemia K562/ADM cells, with a detection limit of ~10(3) cells mL(-1).

A functional complementation assay has further shown that UL97 has authentic Cdk-like activity. The other seven human herpesviruses each encode a kinase with sequence and positional homology to UL97. These UL97-homologous proteins have been termed the conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs) to distinguish them from other human herpesvirus-encoded kinases. To determine if the Cdk-like activities of UL97 were shared by all of the CHPKs, we individually expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each protein in human Saos-2 cells to test for Rb phosphorylation, human U-2 OS cells to monitor nuclear lamina disruption and lamin A phosphorylation, or S. cerevisiae cdc28-13 mutant cells to directly assay for Cdk function. We found that the ability to phosphorylate Rb and lamin A, and to disrupt the nuclear lamina, was shared by all CHPKs from the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families, but not by their alpha-herpesvirus homologs. Similarly, all but one of the beta and gamma CHPKs displayed bona fide Cdk activity in S. cerevisiae, while the alpha proteins did not. Thus, we have identified novel virally-encoded Cdk-like kinases, a nomenclature we abbreviate as v-Cdks. Interestingly, we found that other, non-Cdk-related activities reported for UL97 (dispersion of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and disruption of cytoplasmic or nuclear aggresomes) showed weak conservation among the CHPKs that, in general, did not segregate to specific viral families. Therefore, the genomic and evolutionary conservation of these kinases has not been fully maintained at the functional level. Our data indicate that these related kinases, some of which are targets of approved or developmental antiviral drugs, are likely to serve both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during viral infections.","['Kuny, Chad V', 'Chinchilla, Karen', 'Culbertson, Michael R', 'Kalejta, Robert F']","['Kuny CV', 'Chinchilla K', 'Culbertson MR', 'Kalejta RF']","['Institute for Molecular Virology and McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100909,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Betaherpesvirinae/*enzymology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Gammaherpesvirinae/*enzymology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Lamina/enzymology', 'Osteosarcoma/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/09/15 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1001092 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2010 Sep 9;6(9):e1001092. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001092.,"['R01 AI080675/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI078985/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI080675/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2936540,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent studies suggest that the counterbalance between HTLV-I/Tax and PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein PDLIM2 may determine the outcome of HTLV-I infection. Although HTLV-I represses PDLIM2 epigenetically and specifically in transformed cells, PDLIM2 shuttles Tax into the nuclear matrix for ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing the transforming ability of HTLV-I. Here, we have further shown that PDLIM2 binds to Tax directly, which was mediated by a putative alpha-helix motif of PDLIM2 at amino acids 236-254. Consistently, selective disruption of this short-helix crippled PDLIM2 in shutting Tax to the nuclear matrix for ubiquitination-mediated degradation, therefore, PDLIM2 lost the ability in tumor suppression. Although the C-terminal LIM domain of PDLIM2 was not required for Tax binding, it was important for PDLIM2 to interact with the nuclear matrix. Accordingly, the LIM domain was essential for PDLIM2-mediated Tax repression. On the contrary, the N-terminal PDZ domain of PDLIM2 was dispensable for all these events, although the PDZ domain was involved in PDLIM2 binding to cytoskeleton. These studies dissect functional sequences within PDLIM2 and their distinct roles in Tax regulation.","['Fu, J', 'Yan, P', 'Li, S', 'Qu, Z', 'Xiao, G']","['Fu J', 'Yan P', 'Li S', 'Qu Z', 'Xiao G']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (PDLIM2 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2010/09/15 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010374 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.374 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Dec 9;29(49):6499-507. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.374.

Not surprisingly, TRAIL is downregulated in a variety of tumor cells, including BCR-ABL-positive leukemia. Although we know much about the molecular basis of TRAIL-mediated cell killing, the mechanism responsible for TRAIL inhibition in tumors remains elusive because (a) TRAIL can be regulated by retinoic acid (RA); (b) the tumor antigen preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) was shown to inhibit transcription of RA receptor target genes through the polycomb protein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2); and (c) we have found that TRAIL is inversely correlated with BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Thus, we decided to investigate the association of PRAME, EZH2 and TRAIL in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that PRAME, but not EZH2, is upregulated in BCR-ABL cells and is associated with the progression of disease in CML patients. There is a positive correlation between PRAME and BCR-ABL and an inverse correlation between PRAME and TRAIL in these patients. Importantly, knocking down PRAME or EZH2 by RNA interference in a BCR-ABL-positive cell line restores TRAIL expression. Moreover, there is an enrichment of EZH2 binding on the promoter region of TRAIL in a CML cell line. This binding is lost after PRAME knockdown. Finally, knocking down PRAME or EZH2, and consequently induction of TRAIL expression, enhances Imatinib sensibility. Taken together, our data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism responsible for lowering TRAIL expression and provide the basis of alternative targets for combined therapeutic strategies for CML.","['De Carvalho, D D', 'Binato, R', 'Pereira, W O', 'Leroy, J M G', 'Colassanti, M D', 'Proto-Siqueira, R', 'Bueno-Da-Silva, A E B', 'Zago, M A', 'Zanichelli, M A', 'Abdelhay, E', 'Castro, F A', 'Jacysyn, J F', 'Amarante-Mendes, G P']","['De Carvalho DD', 'Binato R', 'Pereira WO', 'Leroy JM', 'Colassanti MD', 'Proto-Siqueira R', 'Bueno-Da-Silva AE', 'Zago MA', 'Zanichelli MA', 'Abdelhay E', 'Castro FA', 'Jacysyn JF', 'Amarante-Mendes GP']","['Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/09/15 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010409 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.409 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Jan 13;30(2):223-33. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.409.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study investigates the long-term effectiveness of maintenance doses of MPH in survivors of childhood brain tumors (n = 35) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 33) participating in a 12-month MPH trial. Measures of attention (Conners' Continuous Performance Test [CPT], Conners' Rating Scales [CRS]), academic abilities (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test [WIAT]), social skills (Social Skills Rating System [SSRS]), and behavioral problems (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) were administered at premedication baseline and at the end of the MPH trial while on medication. A cancer control group composed of patients who were not administered MPH (brain tumor = 31 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia = 23) was assessed on the same measures 12 [corrected] months apart. RESULTS: For the MPH group, repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant improvement in performance on a measure of sustained attention (CPT indices, P < .05); parent, teacher, and self-report ratings of attention (CRS indices, P < .05), and parent ratings of social skills or behavioral problems (SSRS and CBCL indices; P < .05). In contrast, the cancer control group only showed improvement on parent ratings of attention (Conners' Parent Rating Scale indices; P < .05) and social skills (SSRS and CBCL indices; P < .05). There was no significant improvement on the academic measure (WIAT) in either group. CONCLUSION: Attention and behavioral benefits of MPH for childhood cancer survivors are maintained across settings over the course of a year. Although academic gains were not identified, MPH may offer benefits in academic areas not assessed.","['Conklin, Heather M', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Ashford, Jason', 'Ogg, Susan', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Morris, E Brannon', 'Brown, Ronald', 'Bonner, Melanie', 'Christensen, Robbin', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Khan, Raja B']","['Conklin HM', 'Reddick WE', 'Ashford J', 'Ogg S', 'Howard SC', 'Morris EB', 'Brown R', 'Bonner M', 'Christensen R', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Khan RB']","[""Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. heather.conklin@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention/*drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/psychology', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Learning/drug effects', 'Male', 'Methylphenidate/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.4026 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.4026 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Oct 10;28(29):4465-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.4026.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a validated target in mantle cell lymphoma, but has not been extensively evaluated in other lymphomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a phase II trial of single-agent temsirolimus 25-mg weekly in patients with relapsed aggressive and indolent lymphomas. The primary objective was overall and complete response rate. Patients were stratified by histology: group A (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma), group B (follicular lymphoma), and group C (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and other indolent lymphomas). RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were treated, with outcome strongly dependent on histology. Group A had an overall and complete response rate of 28.1% and 12.5%, respectively, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.6 months and median overall survival (OS) of 7.2 months. Group B had overall and complete response rates of 53.8% and 25.6%, respectively, and median PFS of 12.7 months; median OS has not yet been reached. Group C had a partial response rate of 11% with no complete responders. Toxicity was mainly mild and/or reversible myelosuppression and mucositis; however, four patients developed pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent temsirolimus has significant activity in both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, although the durability of responses and PFS are longer for patients with follicular lymphoma. This is the first report of substantial activity of temsirolimus in lymphomas other than mantle cell lymphoma, and supports further evaluation of mTOR as a target in these diseases.","['Smith, Sonali M', 'van Besien, Koen', 'Karrison, Theodore', 'Dancey, Janet', 'McLaughlin, Peter', 'Younes, Anas', 'Smith, Scott', 'Stiff, Patrick', 'Lester, Eric', 'Modi, Sanjiv', 'Doyle, L Austin', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Pro, Barbara']","['Smith SM', 'van Besien K', 'Karrison T', 'Dancey J', 'McLaughlin P', 'Younes A', 'Smith S', 'Stiff P', 'Lester E', 'Modi S', 'Doyle LA', 'Vokes EE', 'Pro B']","['The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. smsmith@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100913,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '624KN6GM2T (temsirolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Chicago', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucositis/chemically induced', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/11/10 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.29.2813 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.29.2813 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Nov 1;28(31):4740-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.29.2813.

Accordingly, many successful molecularly targeted anticancer therapeutics are directed at inhibiting kinase activity. To assess kinase activity in minute patient samples, we have developed an immunocapture-based in vitro kinase assay on an integrated polydimethylsiloxane microfluidics platform that can reproducibly measure kinase activity from as few as 3,000 cells. For this platform, we adopted the standard radiometric (32)P-ATP-labeled phosphate transfer assay. Implementation on a microfluidic device required us to develop methods for repeated trapping and mixing of solid-phase affinity microbeads. We also developed a solid-state beta-particle camera imbedded directly below the microfluidic device for real-time quantitative detection of the signal from this and other microfluidic radiobioassays. We show that the resulting integrated device can measure ABL kinase activity from BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patient samples. The low sample input requirement of the device creates new potential for direct kinase activity experimentation and diagnostics on patient blood, bone marrow, and needle biopsy samples.","['Fang, Cong', 'Wang, Yanju', 'Vu, Nam T', 'Lin, Wei-Yu', 'Hsieh, Yao-Te', 'Rubbi, Liudmilla', 'Phelps, Michael E', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Chatziioannou, Arion F', 'Tseng, Hsian-Rong', 'Graeber, Thomas G']","['Fang C', 'Wang Y', 'Vu NT', 'Lin WY', 'Hsieh YT', 'Rubbi L', 'Phelps ME', 'Muschen M', 'Kim YM', 'Chatziioannou AF', 'Tseng HR', 'Graeber TG']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '63148-62-9 (baysilon)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microfluidics/instrumentation/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Radiometry', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-0851 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0851 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 1;70(21):8299-308. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0851.

Perturbations in NSD family members can lead to Sotos syndrome and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome as well as cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia. Previous studies have implicated NSD1 (KMT3B) in transcription and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3-K36), but its molecular mechanism in these processes remains largely unknown. Here we describe an NSD1 regulatory network in human cells. We show that NSD1 binds near various promoter elements and regulates multiple genes that appear to have a concerted role in various processes, such as cell growth/cancer, keratin biology, and bone morphogenesis. In particular, we show that NSD1 binding is concentrated upstream of gene targets such as the bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and zinc finger protein 36 C3H type-like 1 (ZFP36L1/TPP). NSD1 regulates the levels of the various forms of methylation at H3-K36 primarily, but not exclusively, within the promoter proximal region occupied by NSD1. At BMP4 we find that this reduces the levels of RNAP II recruited to the promoter, suggesting a role for NSD1-dependent methylation in initiation. Interestingly, we also observe that the RNAP II molecules that lie within BMP4 have inappropriate persistence of serine-5 phosphorylation and reduced levels of serine-2 phosphorylation within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAP II. Our findings indicate that NSD1 regulates RNAP II recruitment to BMP4, and failure to do so leads to reduced gene expression and abrogated levels of H3K36Me and CTD phosphorylation.","['Lucio-Eterovic, Agda Karina', 'Singh, Melissa M', 'Gardner, Jeffrey E', 'Veerappan, Chendhore S', 'Rice, Judd C', 'Carpenter, Phillip B']","['Lucio-Eterovic AK', 'Singh MM', 'Gardner JE', 'Veerappan CS', 'Rice JC', 'Carpenter PB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Butyrate Response Factor 1)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (ZFP36L1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/genetics', 'Butyrate Response Factor 1/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1002653107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1002653107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 28;107(39):16952-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1002653107.

P2X7 is a member of the P2X family of receptors, which are ATP-gated plasma membrane ion channels with diverse biological functions. Abnormal expression and dysfunction of P2X7 have been reported in leukemias. Here, we report a new P2X7 mutant (an A(559)-to-G substitution causing N187D P2X7) cloned from J6-1 leukemia cells. The characteristics of N187D P2X7 were studied by establishing stably transfected K562 cell lines. Our results show that N187D P2X7 required a higher concentration of agonist for its activation, leading to Ca(2+) influx (EC(50) = 293.3 +/- 6.6 mum for the mutant and 93.6 +/- 2.2 mum for wild-type P2X7) and ERK phosphorylation, which were not caused by differential cell-surface expression or related to high ATPase activity on the cell surface and in the extracellular space. K562 cells expressing this N187D mutant showed a proliferative advantage and reduced pro-apoptosis effects in vitro and in vivo.

Reasons for these differences may include the methodology to determine KIR(-ligand) incompatibility, the disease distribution and the transplant protocol or donor type. Two retrospective studies on the effects of KIR-ligand incompatibility in unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for haematological malignancies have resulted in conflicting results. The Eurocord study showed a favourable effect of KIR-ligand mismatching on relapse incidence and leukaemia-free survival, whereas the Minneapolis study showed no effect on these end points and a detrimental effect on incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In patients with non-malignant disorders, KIR-ligand (in)compatibility between donor and recipient was not associated with outcomes in a recent Eurocord analysis. Therefore, the role of natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity in UCBT is far from clear. It is too early to use a donor-recipient KIR(-ligand) algorithm for selection of a cord blood donor.","['Willemze, Roel', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Purtill, Duncan', 'Rodrigues, Celso Arrais', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Willemze R', 'Ruggeri A', 'Purtill D', 'Rodrigues CA', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.

Both strategies have important advantages such as shorter time to transplant, which is particularly relevant to patients requiring urgent transplantation, and tolerance of HLA mismatched graft that make possible that a donor can be found for virtually all patients. However, in spite of higher incidence of graft failure in UCB transplatation recipients and higher relapse incidence after haplo transplants, final outcomes seem to be comparable with HLA matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (bone marrow or peripheral blood).

In this context, following the preliminary, encouraging results, the transplant of unrelated umbilical cord blood has been progressively increased because of its prompt availability and a more permissive HLA incompatibility between donor and recipient. Furthermore, the decreased risk of GVHD, the use of reduced intensity conditionings and the graft of double cord blood units permit to extend cord blood transplant to a higher proportion of adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, which is predominantly diagnosed in the elderly age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary CLL cells from 77 patients were tested using automated digital fluorescence microscopy. The effect of 27 frequently used chemotherapeutic agents was measured in short-term fluorescence survival assay. To avoid typical in vitro artifacts such as growth factor depletion and oxidative damage, the cell were cultured in a novel, total human blood lysate-based medium (OmniSanguine) in order to preserve the composition of growth factor flora and redox conditions of the in vivo environment. RESULTS: CLL cells from different patients showed considerable heterogeneity in their drug-sensitivity patterns. This pattern was stable even after in vitro activation of cell proliferation.

Healthy and leukemic rats were given EC by gavage at a dose of 40 mg/kg b.w. for 22 consecutive days. Spleen cells were subjected for analysis of DNA damage and apoptosis. The amount of DNA damage was estimated by the comet assay, while apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry using Annexin V staining. Leukemic cells were identified in the spleen cells by indirect immunofluorescence using RM-124 antibody followed by flow cytometry analysis. The results show that EC did not affect DNA damage in the splenocytes of healthy rats, but significantly increased the extent of DNA strand breaks in the spleen cells of leukemic animals. EC administration to leukemic rats induced a significant increase in the level of Annexin V-positive leukemic cells, but the level of non-leukemic Annexin V-positive cells remained unchanged in comparison to control. The percentage of leukemic cells decreased significantly under EC influence comparing to the untreated group. The results of the study reveal that EC could be used as an effective supplement of standard therapy against acute myeloid leukemia.","['Papiez, M A', 'Baran, J', 'Bukowska-Strakova, K', 'Wiczkowski, W']","['Papiez MA', 'Baran J', 'Bukowska-Strakova K', 'Wiczkowski W']","['Department of Cytobiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. mfpapiez@cyf-kr.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100915,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Purines)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Catechin/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Purines/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Spleen/drug effects/*pathology']",2010/09/15 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(10)00573-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2010.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2010 Dec;48(12):3391-7. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2010.09.010.

Apart from its inhibitor function, Celecoxib induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway which is controlled by the Bcl-2 family members. In Jurkat T lymphoma cells, treatment with Celecoxib results in a rapid decline of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related protein Mcl-1. The depletion of Mcl-1 is sufficient for apoptosis induction and can be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-xL but not by the close homologue Bcl-2. The present investigation analyzed the mechanism by which Bcl-xL prevents apoptosis induction whereas Bcl-2 failed to. Our data show that the involvement of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77/TR3 specifically targeting Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL was not involved in Celecoxib-induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, BH3-only proteins Bid, Bim, and Puma of the Bcl-2 family were not needed either. However, unlike Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL sequestered Bak preventing it from activation through a direct interaction.

To investigate the question in a Chinese population, 65 CFS patients and 85 blood donor controls were enrolled and multiplex real-time PCR or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was developed to analyze the XMRV infection status of the study participants. The assay was standardized by constructing plasmid DNAs and armored RNAs as XMRV standards and competitive internal controls (CICs), respectively. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the multiplex real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were 20 copies/reaction and 10 IU/ml, respectively, with 100% specificity. The within-run precision coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 1.76% to 2.80% and 1.70% to 2.59%, while the between-run CV ranged from 1.07% to 2.56% and 1.06% to 2.74%. XMRV was not detected in the 65 CFS patients and 65 normal individuals out of 85 controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to show XMRV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of Chinese patients with CFS. The absence of XMRV nucleic acids does not support an association between XMRV infection and the development of CFS in Chinese.","['Hong, Ping', 'Li, Jinming', 'Li, Yongzhe']","['Hong P', 'Li J', 'Li Y']","[""Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20100913,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,,IM,"['Adult', 'Asians', 'Blood/*virology', 'China', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*virology', 'Female', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Virology/methods']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-7-224 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-7-224 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2010 Sep 13;7:224. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-7-224.,,PMC2945957,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a specific and potent inducer of apoptosis and suppressor of cell growth. In leukemia, chemoresistance generally developed due to deregulated ceramide metabolism. In combinatorial treatment strategies of leukemia, few components have the capability to increases ceramide production. Manipulation in ceramide production by physiological and pharmacological modulators therefore will give additive effect in leukemia chemotherapy. RESULTS: Here, we show that Withanolide D (C4beta-C5beta,C6beta-epoxy-1-oxo-,20beta, dihydroxy-20S,22R-witha-2,24-dienolide; WithaD), a pure herbal compound isolated from Withania somnifera could effectively induces apoptosis in a dose and time dependant manner both in myeloid (K562) and lymphoid (MOLT-4) cells being nontoxic to normal lymphocytes and control proliferative cells. WithaD potentially augment ceramide production in these cells. Downstream of ceramide, WithaD acted on MKK group of proteins and significantly increased JNK and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38MAPK and JNK proves their cooperative action on WithaD-induced cell death. Dissecting the cause of ceramide production, we found activation of neutral sphingomyelinase and showed neutral-sphingomyelinase 2 (N-SMase 2) is a critical mediator of WithaD-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of N-SMase 2 by siRNA and inhibitor of N-SMase (GW4869) significantly reduced WithaD-induced ceramide generation and phosphorylation of MKK4 and MKK3/6, whereas phosphorylation of MKK7 was moderately regulated in leukemic cells. Also, both by silencing of N-SMase 2 and/or blocking by GW4869 protects these cells from WithaD-mediated death and suppressed apoptosis, whereas Fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, did not have any effect. Additionally, WithaD effectively induced apoptosis in freshly isolated lymphoblasts from patients and the potent cell killing activity was through JNK and p38MAPK activation. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that WithaD enhance the ceramide accumulation by activating N-SMase 2, modulate phosphorylation of the JNK and p38MAPK and induced apoptosis in both myeloid and lymphoid cells along with primary cells derived from leukemia patients. Taken together, this pure herbal compound (WithaD) may consider as a potential alternative tool with additive effects in conjunction with traditional chemotherapeutic treatment, thereby accelerate the process of conventional drug development.","['Mondal, Susmita', 'Mandal, Chandan', 'Sangwan, Rajender', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Mondal S', 'Mandal C', 'Sangwan R', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C']","['Infectious diseases and immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, A Unit of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Govt, of India; 4, Raja S, C, Mullick Road, Kolkata 700032, India. cmandal@iicb.res.in.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100913,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (GW 4869)', '0 (Withanolides)', '30655-48-2 (withanolide D)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylidene Compounds/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 6/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 7/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Withanolides/*therapeutic use', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/09/15 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-239 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-239 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Sep 13;9:239. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-239.,,PMC2949798,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As these contribute to tumor initiation and sustenance, catalytic redox agents combining significant activity with substrate specificity promise high activity and selectivity against oxidatively stressed malignant cells. We describe here the design and synthesis of novel organochalcogen based redox sensor/effector catalysts. Their selective anticancer activity at submicromolar and low micromolar concentrations was established here in a range of tumor entities in various biological systems including cell lines, primary tumor cell cultures, and animal models. In the B-cell derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), for instance, such compounds preferentially induce apoptosis in the cancer cells while peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and the subset of normal B-cells remain largely unaffected. In support of the concept of sensor/effector based ROS amplification, we are able to demonstrate that underlying this selective activity against CLL cells are pre-existing elevated ROS levels in the leukemic cells compared to their nonmalignant counterparts. Furthermore, the catalysts act in concert with certain chemotherapeutic drugs in several carcinoma cell lines to decrease cell proliferation while showing no such interactions in normal cells. Overall, the high efficacy and selectivity of (redox) catalytic sensor/effector compounds warrant further, extensive testing toward transfer into the clinical arena.","['Doering, Mandy', 'Ba, Lalla A', 'Lilienthal, Nils', 'Nicco, Carole', 'Scherer, Christiane', 'Abbas, Muhammad', 'Zada, Abdul Ali Peer', 'Coriat, Romain', 'Burkholz, Torsten', 'Wessjohann, Ludger', 'Diederich, Marc', 'Batteux, Frederic', 'Herling, Marco', 'Jacob, Claus']","['Doering M', 'Ba LA', 'Lilienthal N', 'Nicco C', 'Scherer C', 'Abbas M', 'Zada AA', 'Coriat R', 'Burkholz T', 'Wessjohann L', 'Diederich M', 'Batteux F', 'Herling M', 'Jacob C']","['Division of Bioorganic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Saarland University, D-66123 Saarbruecken, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfides)', 'NQA0O090ZJ (Tellurium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Naphthoquinones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Quinones/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Tellurium']",2010/09/15 06:00,2010/11/10 06:00,['2010/09/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm100576z [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2010 Oct 14;53(19):6954-63. doi: 10.1021/jm100576z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease progresses after several years from an initial chronic phase to a blast phase. Leukemia-specific T cells are regularly detected in CML patients and may be involved in the immunological control of the disease. Here, we analyzed the role of leukemia-specific CD8(+) T cells in CML disease control and the mechanism that maintains CD8(+) T-cell immunosurveillance in a retroviral-induced murine CML model. To study antigen-specific immune responses, the glycoprotein of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was used as model leukemia antigen. Leukemia-specific CTL activity was detectable in vivo in CML mice and depletion of CD8(+) T cells rapidly led to disease progression. CML-specific CTL were characterized by the expression of the IL-7 receptor alpha-chain. In addition, leukemia cells produced IL-7 that was crucial for the maintenance of leukemia-specific CTL and for disease control. Therefore, CML cells maintain the specific CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immune control by IL-7 secretion. This results in prolonged control of disease and probably contributes to the characteristic chronic phase of the disease.","['Mumprecht, Sabine', 'Schurch, Christian', 'Scherrer, Sandro', 'Claus, Christina', 'Ochsenbein, Adrian F']","['Mumprecht S', 'Schurch C', 'Scherrer S', 'Claus C', 'Ochsenbein AF']","['Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interleukin-7/genetics/*immunology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2010/09/14 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201040404 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2010 Oct;40(10):2720-30. doi: 10.1002/eji.201040404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of this pathway is promoted by wingless (Wnt) proteins and induces co-activator beta-catenin binding to lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/T-cell factor protein (TCF). To provide a convenient system for the screening of anti-Wnt/beta-catenin agents, we designed a bi-functional pGL4-TOP reporter plasmid that contained 3X beta-catenin/LEF/TCF binding sites and a selectable marker. After transfection and hygromycin B selection, HEK 293-TOP and Jurkat-TOP stable clones were established. The luciferase activity in the stable clone was enhanced by the recombinant Wnt-3A (rWnt-3A; 100-400 ng/mL) and GSK3beta inhibitor (2'Z,3'E)-6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO; 5 microM) but was inhibited by aspirin (5 mM). Using this reporter model, we found that norcantharidin (NCTD; 100 microM) reduced 80% of rWnt-3A-induced luciferase activity. Furthermore, 50 microM NCTD inhibited 38% of BIO-induced luciferase activity in Jurkat-TOP stable cells. Employing (3)H-thymidine uptake assay and Western blot analysis, we confirmed that NCTD (50 microM) significantly inhibited proliferation of Jurkat cells by 64%, which are the dominant beta-catenin signaling cells and decreased beta-catenin protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, we established a stable HEK 293-TOP clone and successfully used it to identify the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibitor NCTD.","['Chuang, K A', 'Lieu, C H', 'Tsai, W J', 'Wu, M H', 'Chen, Y C', 'Liao, J F', 'Wang, C C', 'Kuo, Y C']","['Chuang KA', 'Lieu CH', 'Tsai WJ', 'Wu MH', 'Chen YC', 'Liao JF', 'Wang CC', 'Kuo YC']","['Department of Biotechnology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100910,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"[""0 (6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime)"", '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (WNT3A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8452E71EO7 (norcantharidin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Genes, Reporter/physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Oximes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Plasmids/drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transfection/methods', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt3A Protein', 'beta Catenin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/09/14 06:00,2011/05/05 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2010007500091 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2010007500091 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2010 Oct;43(10):931-41. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2010007500091.

To circumvent the ion suppression of phosphorylated substrate peptides caused by the presence of high abundant non-phosphorylated peptides in the enzymatic reaction mixtures, a separation and enrichment process of the phosphorylated peptides from complex mixtures was carried out by using an in-house fabricated TiO(2) nanoparticle-coated capillary column prior to the MS analysis. With a synthetic phosphopeptide (DAIpYAAPFAKKK), of which the sequence is similar to that of the substrate (EAIYAAPFAKKK) of the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl), as the internal standard, the signal ratio of the phosphorylated substrate to the standard detected by MALDI-TOF MS is linearly correlated with the molar ratio of the two phosphopeptides over the range of 0.3 to 3 with r(2) = 0.99. We validated the MS method by determining the IC(50) value of imatinib, an Abl inhibitor for clinical treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). The obtained IC(50) value (234 nM) is consistent with that determined by ELISA (291 nM). Then, six analogues of imatinib synthesized in our laboratory were screened using the method, giving rise to inhibitory potential results which are in good agreement with the docking analysis data. The developed method is sensitive, operationally simple, does not require isotope-labelling and is cost/time effective, providing an alterative method for rapid screening of PTK inhibitors as therapeutic agents for tumours.","['Lu, Shuang', 'Luo, Qun', 'Li, Xianchan', 'Wu, Jianhong', 'Liu, Jianan', 'Xiong, Shaoxiang', 'Feng, Yu-Qi', 'Wang, Fuyi']","['Lu S', 'Luo Q', 'Li X', 'Wu J', 'Liu J', 'Xiong S', 'Feng YQ', 'Wang F']","['Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Living Biosystems, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '15FIX9V2JP (titanium dioxide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Phosphopeptides/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Titanium/*chemistry']",2010/09/14 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c0an00339e [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2010 Nov;135(11):2858-63. doi: 10.1039/c0an00339e.

Earlier studies from The South Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority have reported 50 % five-year overall survival in patients treated according to this protocol. This article presents survival data for Norwegian adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia on a national basis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data for all patients between 15 and 65 years, who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the period 2000-2007 according to The Norwegian Registry for Acute Leukaemia and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, and were treated with chemotherapy with a curative intent were analysed for survival. RESULTS: 128 patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the study period. The overall remission rate was 85.9 %. Five-year survival was 49.2 % overall, 31.4 % for patients 40 years or older and 62.6 % for those younger than 40 years. INTERPRETATION: These results are in line with previous Norwegian studies and show a five- year overall survival which is more than 10 % higher than that reported in international multicenter studies. One explanation can be that the Norwegian treatment program is more intensive than most treatment protocols used in other countries.","['Tangen, Jon-Magnus', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Haukas, Einar', 'Naess, Inger Anne', 'Skjelbakken, Tove', 'Stapnes, Camilla', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E']","['Tangen JM', 'Floisand Y', 'Haukas E', 'Naess IA', 'Skjelbakken T', 'Stapnes C', 'Tjonnfjord GE']","['Avdeling for blodsykdommer, Oslo universitetssykehus, Ulleval, 0407 Oslo, Norway. jmta@uus.no']",['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/14 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['2009335 [pii]', '10.4045/tidsskr.09.1293 [doi]']",ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2010 Sep 9;130(17):1710-3. doi: 10.4045/tidsskr.09.1293.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Overlevelse hos voksne med akutt lymfoblastisk leukemi.,,,,,,

Factors measurable before starting treatment with third line therapy and cytogenetic responses at 3 months can accurately predict subsequent outcome and thus guide clinical decisions.","['Ibrahim, Amr R', 'Paliompeis, Christos', 'Bua, Marco', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Reid, Alistair', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Dazzi, Francesco', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Goldman, John M', 'Marin, David']","['Ibrahim AR', 'Paliompeis C', 'Bua M', 'Milojkovic D', 'Szydlo R', 'Khorashad JS', 'Foroni L', 'Reid A', 'de Lavallade H', 'Rezvani K', 'Dazzi F', 'Apperley JF', 'Goldman JM', 'Marin D']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100910,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/09/14 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60344-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-291922 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 16;116(25):5497-500. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-291922.

Here we report that the human Vent-like homeobox gene VENTX, a putative homolog of the Xenopus xvent2 gene, is a unique regulatory hematopoietic gene that is aberrantly expressed in CD34(+) leukemic stem-cell candidates in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Quantitative RT-PCR documented expression of the gene in lineage positive hematopoietic subpopulations, with the highest expression in CD33(+) myeloid cells. Notably, expression levels of VENTX were negligible in normal CD34(+)/CD38(-) or CD34(+) human progenitor cells. In contrast to this, leukemic CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells from AML patients with translocation t(8,21) and normal karyotype displayed aberrantly high expression of VENTX. Gene expression and pathway analysis demonstrated that in normal CD34(+) cells enforced expression of VENTX initiates genes associated with myeloid development and down-regulates genes involved in early lymphoid development. Functional analyses confirmed that aberrant expression of VENTX in normal CD34(+) human progenitor cells perturbs normal hematopoietic development, promoting generation of myeloid cells and impairing generation of lymphoid cells in vitro and in vivo. Stable knockdown of VENTX expression inhibited the proliferation of human AML cell lines. Taken together, these data extend our insights into the function of embryonic mesodermal factors in human postnatal hematopoiesis and indicate a role for VENTX in normal and malignant myelopoiesis.","['Rawat, Vijay P S', 'Arseni, Natalia', 'Ahmed, Farid', 'Mulaw, Medhanie A', 'Thoene, Silvia', 'Heilmeier, Bernhard', 'Sadlon, Tim', ""D'Andrea, Richard J"", 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Buske, Christian', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela']","['Rawat VP', 'Arseni N', 'Ahmed F', 'Mulaw MA', 'Thoene S', 'Heilmeier B', 'Sadlon T', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Buske C', 'Feuring-Buske M']","['Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center Ulm and University Hospital Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100910,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (VENTX protein, human)']",IM,"['Coculture Techniques', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics']",2010/09/14 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1001878107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1001878107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 28;107(39):16946-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1001878107.

In this study, we investigated the effect of haplophytin-A on the apoptotic activity and the molecular mechanism of action in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Treatment with haplophytin-A (50muM) induced classical features of apoptosis, such as, DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder formation, and the externalization of annexin-V-targeted phosphatidylserine residues in HL-60 cells. In addition, haplophytin-A triggered the activations of caspase-8, -9, and -3, and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in HL-60 cells. In addition, haplophytin-A caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO to the cytosol, and modulated the expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins. We further demonstrated that knockdown of caspase-8 using its siRNA inhibited the mitochondrial translocation of tBid, the activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and subsequent DNA fragmentation by haplophytin-A. Furthermore, haplophytin-A-induced the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and then activated caspase-8 in HL-60 cells. During haplophytin-A-induced apoptosis, caspase-8-stimulated tBid provide a link between the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and the mitochondria- mediated intrinsic pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the novel compound haplophytin-A play therapeutical role for leukemia via the potent apoptotic activity through the extrinsic pathway, involving the intrinsic pathway.","['Won, Kyung-Jae', 'Chung, Kyung-Sook', 'Lee, Yong Sup', 'Alia, Muhammad Shaiq', 'Pervez, Muhammad Kashif', 'Fatima, Samreen', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Won KJ', 'Chung KS', 'Lee YS', 'Alia MS', 'Pervez MK', 'Fatima S', 'Choi JH', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100915,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (10-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2,6-dihydropyrano(3,2-c)quinolin-5-one)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2010/09/14 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(10)00545-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2010.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Dec 5;188(3):505-11. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2010.09.001.

A total of 5420 cattle (dairy, 3966; breeding beef, 797; fattening beef, 657) from 209 farms in seven prefectures in Japan were tested. The overall prevalence of BLV infection was 28.6%. The prevalence of BLV infection in dairy cattle (34.7%) was higher than for both fattening beef cattle (7.9%) and breeding beef cattle (16.3%). Age-specific prevalence showed that BLV prevalence increased with age in all types of cattle and was notably different between dairy and beef cattle under 1 year of age. Among 207 farms, 141 herds (68.1%) had one or more positive animals. The proportion of these positive farms was significantly higher among dairy farms (79.1%) than among beef breeding farms (39.5%) and beef fattening farms (51.9%) (P<0.001). Dairy farms (40.5%) also showed a significantly higher within-herd prevalence than beef breeding (27.4%) and fattening (14.9%) farms (P=0.001). This study indicated that BLV is more widely spread in dairy cattle than in beef breeding cattle in Japan. Given the prevalence of BLV infection in dairy and beef cattle was 8- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than rates previously found in 1980-1982, BLV appears to be spreading particularly among the dairy cattle population during the last two decades. Further investigation is required to determine the risk factors necessary to control BLV infection that take into account the different farming practices that exist between dairy and beef sectors.","['Murakami, Kenji', 'Kobayashi, Sota', 'Konishi, Misako', 'Kameyama, Ken-ichiro', 'Yamamoto, Takehisa', 'Tsutsui, Toshiyuki']","['Murakami K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Konishi M', 'Kameyama K', 'Yamamoto T', 'Tsutsui T']","['National Institute of Animal Health, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0856, Japan. muraken@affrc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100818,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle/*virology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Prevalence', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2010/09/14 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2009/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(10)00373-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2011 Feb 24;148(1):84-8. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.08.001.

Here, we visualize Notch-induced NF-kappaB activation using both human T-ALL cell lines and animal models. We demonstrate that Hes1, a canonical Notch target and transcriptional repressor, is responsible for sustaining IKK activation in T-ALL. Hes1 exerts its effects by repressing the deubiquitinase CYLD, a negative IKK complex regulator. CYLD expression was found to be significantly suppressed in primary T-ALL. Finally, we demonstrate that IKK inhibition is a promising option for the targeted therapy of T-ALL as specific suppression of IKK expression and function affected both the survival of human T-ALL cells and the maintenance of the disease in vivo.","['Espinosa, Lluis', 'Cathelin, Severine', ""D'Altri, Teresa"", 'Trimarchi, Thomas', 'Statnikov, Alexander', 'Guiu, Jordi', 'Rodilla, Veronica', 'Ingles-Esteve, Julia', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Besses, Carles', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Kucine, Nicole', 'Sun, Shao-Cong', 'Song, Guangchan', 'Mullighan, Charles C', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Rajewsky, Klaus', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Bigas, Anna']","['Espinosa L', 'Cathelin S', ""D'Altri T"", 'Trimarchi T', 'Statnikov A', 'Guiu J', 'Rodilla V', 'Ingles-Esteve J', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Bellosillo B', 'Besses C', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Kucine N', 'Sun SC', 'Song G', 'Mullighan CC', 'Levine RL', 'Rajewsky K', 'Aifantis I', 'Bigas A']","[""Cancer Research Program, Institut Municipal d'Investigacions Mediques, (IMIM), Hospital del Mar, 08003 Barcelona, Spain. lespinosa@imim.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (CYLD protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2010/09/14 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(10)00302-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2010.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2010 Sep 14;18(3):268-81. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.08.006.,"['R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CE149655/CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United States', 'R01CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR029893/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1UL1RR029893/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R21 CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56LM007948/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 LM007948/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2963042,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here we studied the mechanisms of action of Chl in greater detail. Chl treatment induced an early accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Bcr-Abl(+) cells leading to downregulation of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation and apoptosis. Chl treatment upregulated death receptor DR5 and induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-8 partially inhibited apoptosis, whereas caspase-9 and pan-caspase inhibitor almost completely blocked the killing. Knocking down DR5 using siRNA completely attenuated Chl-induced caspase-8 cleavage but partially inhibited apoptosis. Antioxidant NAC attenuated Chl-induced oxidative stress-mediated inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation, DR5 upregulation, caspase activation and CML cell death. Our data suggested the involvement of parallel death pathways that converged in mitochondria. The role of ROS in Chl-induced death was confirmed with primary leukemia cells from CML patients in vitro as well as in vivo in nude mice bearing K562 xenografts. Collectively, our results establish the role of ROS for Chl-mediated preferential killing of Bcr-Abl(+) cells.","['Rakshit, Srabanti', 'Mandal, Labanya', 'Pal, Bikas Chandra', 'Bagchi, Jayashree', 'Biswas, Nabendu', 'Chaudhuri, Jaydeep', 'Chowdhury, Avik Acharya', 'Manna, Anirban', 'Chaudhuri, Utpal', 'Konar, Aditya', 'Mukherjee, Tulika', 'Jaisankar, Parasuraman', 'Bandyopadhyay, Santu']","['Rakshit S', 'Mandal L', 'Pal BC', 'Bagchi J', 'Biswas N', 'Chaudhuri J', 'Chowdhury AA', 'Manna A', 'Chaudhuri U', 'Konar A', 'Mukherjee T', 'Jaisankar P', 'Bandyopadhyay S']","['Department of Infectious Diseases & Immunology, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, A Unit of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), 4, Raja S.C.

The central hypothesis examined was that addition of active vaccination against leukemia cells would substantially increase the effectiveness of allogeneic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) against ALL present in the host after transplantation. Although vaccination did increase the magnitude of type I T cell responses against leukemia cells associated with DLI, it did not lead to substantial improvement in long-term survival. Analysis of immunologic mechanisms of leukemia progression demonstrated that the failure of vaccination was not because of antigen loss in leukemia cells. However, analysis of survival provided surprising findings that, in addition to very modest type I T cell responses, a B cell response that produced antibodies that bind leukemia cells was found in long-term survivors. The risk of death from leukemia was significantly lower in recipients that had higher levels of such antibodies.

The incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) did not differ significantly between the 2 cohorts. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in HID (26%) than in ISD patients (49%) (P = .008). The 2-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was comparable in recipients of HID (34%) and ISD grafts (38%) (P = .85).

The toxicity of nuclear waste associated with the extreme difficulty of their disposal and increase in cancer mortality and incidence following occupational radiation exposure are considered the only health problems. METHODS: A search of scientific articles and government documents published since January 1, 1980 to July 1, 2010 was performed to evaluate cancer rate and mortality in residents, particularly children, in the vicinity of NPPs. RESULTS: A recent well conducted state-of-the-art case-control study of childhood cancers in the areas around German NPPs (KiKK study) showed a statistically significant cancers (2.2-fold increase in leukemia and a 1.6-fold increase in solid tumor) among children under five years of age living in the inner 5 km circle around NPPs when compared to residence outside this area. These findings have been confirmed by two meta-analyses. Nevertheless, other UK, France, Spain and Finland studies did not find cancer incidence and/or death increase near NPPs. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cancer risk near NPPs remains in fact an open question. The stronger evidence from the KiKK study suggests there may well be such increases at least in children regardless of the country in which nuclear reactors are located. In fact, few months ago the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to perform a state-of-the-art study on cancer risk for populations surrounding NPPs.","['Ghirga, Giovanni']",['Ghirga G'],"['International Society of Doctors for Environment Alto Lazio, Italy. gi8589pa@virgilio.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100910,England,Ital J Pediatr,Italian journal of pediatrics,101510759,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Child', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*adverse effects']",2010/09/14 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1824-7288-36-60 [pii]', '10.1186/1824-7288-36-60 [doi]']",epublish,Ital J Pediatr. 2010 Sep 10;36:60. doi: 10.1186/1824-7288-36-60.,,PMC2944154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic graft-versus-host disease is associated with autoimmune phenomena similar, but not identical, to those observed in various rheumatologic disorders, implicating autoimmunity as an important component of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 57-year-old Caucasian man who developed the nephrotic syndrome due to membranous nephropathy in association with recurrent chronic graft-versus-host disease, along with a lupus-like syndrome manifested with pancytopenia, hair loss, positive anti-DNA antibodies and sub-epithelial and mesangial immune deposits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature. The nephrotic syndrome subsided soon after he was treated with a short course of cyclosporin with steroids. Unfortunately he died seven months later due to a relapse of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our case report confirms the notion that chronic graft-versus-host disease is characterized by the appearance of autoimmune phenomena similar, but not identical, to those seen in autoimmune diseases. The decision for more immunosuppression has to be weighed against the need for preservation of the graft versus leukemia phenomenon.","['Stylianou, Kostas', 'Stratakis, Stavros', 'Mavroeidi, Vasiliki', 'Petrakis, Ioannis', 'Xydakis, Dimitris', 'Vardaki, Eleftheria', 'Stratigis, Spyros', 'Perakis, Kostas', 'Katsarou, Theodora', 'Kanellou, Peggy', 'Xylouri, Irene', 'Petraki, Constantina', 'Alexandrakis, Michael', 'Daphnis, Eugene']","['Stylianou K', 'Stratakis S', 'Mavroeidi V', 'Petrakis I', 'Xydakis D', 'Vardaki E', 'Stratigis S', 'Perakis K', 'Katsarou T', 'Kanellou P', 'Xylouri I', 'Petraki C', 'Alexandrakis M', 'Daphnis E']","['Nephrology Department, Heraklion University Hospital, PO Box 1352, 71110 Heraklion, Crete, Greece. kstylianu@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100910,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2010/09/14 06:00,2010/09/14 06:01,['2010/09/14 06:00'],"['2009/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-4-303 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-4-303 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2010 Sep 10;4:303. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-4-303.,,PMC2944192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the clinical utility of cf-DNA in the detection and monitoring of progression of leukemia. METHODS: Plasma samples from 60 patients with acute leukemia were analyzed in comparison to plasma from 30 healthy controls. Plasma DNA was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) by amplifying the beta-actin gene (ACTB). The DNA integrity index was calculated as the ratio of qPCR results (ACTB384/106). Paired diagnostic/complete remission (CR)/relapse samples from eight of 60 patients were analyzed, and the minimum residual disease (MRD) situations were monitored. RESULTS: DNA concentrations (median: 8.80 ng/mL, p=0.004) and DNA integrity (median: 0.51, p<0.001) in cancer patients were significantly higher. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve of DNA and DNA integrity were 0.79 and 0.88, respectively. DNA integrity at CR had a distinct reduction and then an increase at relapse. DNA integrity in CR cases was higher than that observed in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest that plasma DNA integrity is increased in acute leukemia and may be a potential biomarker for monitoring MRD.

Steroid-mediated apoptosis requires a threshold level of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein, and increasing the intracellular GR levels in ALL cells would augment their hormone sensitivity. A protein transduction domain (PTD) approach was used to accomplish this. We produced an HIV Tat PTD domain fusion protein (Tat-GR(554-777)) that potentially competes for the degradation of GR protein by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and should thus increase its intracellular levels by ""stabilizing"" the GR. We also designed a fusion peptide for the c-Myb DNA binding domain, Tat-c-Myb DBD, since the biological function of this peptide as a dominant negative inhibitor of the c-Myb protein was already known. Purified, bacterially expressed Tat-c-Myb DBD and Tat-GR(554-777) exhibited highly efficient transduction into cultured ALL cell lines including 697 (pre-B-ALL) and CEM-C7 (T-ALL) cells. As expected, the transduced Tat-c-Myb DBD peptide inhibited steroid-mediated stimulation of a GR promoter-luciferase reporter gene. Significantly, transduced Tat-GR(554-777) effectively increased intracellular GR levels in the GC-resistant T-ALL cell line, CEM-C1, and in the pre-B-ALL 697 cell line. Furthermore, transduction of Tat-GR(554-777) rendered GC-resistant CEM-C1 cells sensitive to steroid killing and further sensitized 697 cells to steroid. The use of Tat-fusion peptide transduction may eventually lead to innovative therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical response of patients suffering from T-cell and pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by increasing steroid responsiveness and perhaps converting steroid-resistant leukemia to a hormone-responsive phenotype.","['Geng, Chuan-dong', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Geng CD', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Stanley S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1997 to 2007, 23 children received cranial RT for T-cell or pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Dose fractionation schemes included 18 Gy in 9 fractions (n = 8), 18 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 5), 12.6 Gy in 7 fractions (n = 6), and 12 Gy in 8 fractions (n = 4). These patients were matched and compared to a control group of 23 patients who had ALL but no cranial RT. Height z-scores at diagnosis and last follow-up were compared using the paired Student's t-test. Differences in z-scores according to host and treatment parameters were compared using the unpaired Student's t-test. Median follow-up for irradiated patients was 63.5 months while for unirradiated patients was 91 months. RESULTS: The mean z-scores at initial diagnosis and last follow-up were 0.14 and -0.48 for patients receiving 12-12.6 Gy (P = 0.016), -0.16 and -0.89 for 18 Gy (P = 0.003), and 0.34 and 0.22 for no RT (P = 0.62). For children receiving RT, the mean difference in z-scores at initial diagnosis and last follow-up was -0.67 while for those not receiving RT, it was -0.10 (P = 0.043).

The number of malignant cases varied over year with crude rates of 13.4 per 100,000 in 1982/1983 to 17.3 per 100,000 in 2003/2004. Variation was also seen over diagnosis sub-group and geographic region. CONCLUSIONS: Although a relatively rare number of children and youth in Alberta were diagnosed with cancer during the study period, there were suggestions that an increase incidence in childhood cancer occurred in later years and some geographic areas have more cases than expected by chance. Further study is required to see if emerging trends continue and explain higher rate areas.","['Rosychuk, Rhonda J', 'Witol, Adrienne', 'Stobart, Kent']","['Rosychuk RJ', 'Witol A', 'Stobart K']","['Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. rhonda.rosychuk@ualberta.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100909,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alberta/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/11 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22785 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Dec 15;55(7):1348-55. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22785.

We explored the effects of imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl protein used in front-line CML therapy, on the adhesivity of JURL-MK1 cells to fibronectin and searched for underlying changes in the cell proteome. As imatinib induces apoptosis of JURL-MK1 cells, we used three different caspase inhibitors to discriminate between direct consequences of Bcr-Abl inhibition and secondary changes related to the apoptosis. Imatinib treatment caused a transient increase in JURL-MK1 cell adhesivity to fibronectin, possibly due to the switch off of Bcr-Abl activity. Subsequently, we observed a number of changes including a decrease in cell adhesivity, F-actin decomposition, reduction of integrin beta1, CD44, and paxillin expression levels and a marked increase in cofilin phophorylation at Ser3. These events were generally related to the proceeding apoptosis but they differed in their sensitivity to the individual caspase inhibitors.","['Kuzelova, K', 'Pluskalova, M', 'Grebenova, D', 'Pavlaskova, K', 'Halada, P', 'Hrkal, Z']","['Kuzelova K', 'Pluskalova M', 'Grebenova D', 'Pavlaskova K', 'Halada P', 'Hrkal Z']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. kuzel@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tropomyosin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Paxillin/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tropomyosin/metabolism']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/03/23 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22868 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Dec 15;111(6):1413-25. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22868.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It tends to affect the elderly and is extremely rare in pediatric patients. We describe a case of an 8-month-old Caucasian baby who presented with prominence of left eye and fever without lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Bone survey showed diffuse periosteal reaction in the femur, pelvis, maxillary and orbital bones (with fracture). CBC revealed normal white blood cell count with increased blasts, mild anemia and moderate thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy showed increased myeloblasts with bilineage dysplasia and 3-4+ reticulin fibrosis. Flow cytometry revealed blasts positive for CD34, CD33, and MPO and negative for CD7, CD13, and HLA-DR. Trisomy 10 was demonstrated by chromosome analysis and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. The patient received induction chemotherapy and achieved complete clinical and hematologic remission at day 28. However, he relapsed after three cycles of chemotherapy. Compared to the two other reported pediatric cases, our patient has some unique features such as much younger age and additional findings such as bilineage dysplasia and bone marrow fibrosis. Both reported cases and our case were classified as AML-M2 indicating that this may be a common subtype in pediatric patients. Bone involvement was present in our patient and one other case and both had similar immunophenotype (CD33+, CD7-). These findings suggest that isolated trisomy 10 may be associated with distinct clinicopathologic features in pediatric AML. Studies on additional patients are needed to establish this association.","['Yuan, Ji', 'McDonough, Colleen', 'Kulharya, Anita', 'Ramalingam, Preetha', 'Manaloor, Elizabeth']","['Yuan J', 'McDonough C', 'Kulharya A', 'Ramalingam P', 'Manaloor E']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. jiyuan@mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20100817,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Trisomy/*genetics/*pathology']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2010 Aug 17;3(7):718-22.,,PMC2933392,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD13', 'CD33', 'CD34', 'CD7', 'Trisomy 10', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'infant', 'review']",,,,,,,,,,,

The data indicate that these epitopes in the MPER are an effective target for neutralization and that antigens containing them may therefore prove to be a useful component of vaccines against retroviruses, including HIV-1.","['Langhammer, Stefan', 'Fiebig, Uwe', 'Kurth, Reinhard', 'Denner, Joachim']","['Langhammer S', 'Fiebig U', 'Kurth R', 'Denner J']","['Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100910,Switzerland,Intervirology,Intervirology,0364265,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p15E)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Immunization/*methods', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['000318892 [pii]', '10.1159/000318892 [doi]']",ppublish,Intervirology. 2011 Feb;54(2):78-86. doi: 10.1159/000318892.

METHODS: We report data pertaining to the placement of long-term CVCs in a 7-year period before and after ultrasound guidance was introduced. We included 3951 procedures (total of 1,642,402 catheter days) in our study: 1584 using the anatomical landmark method (landmark group, January 2000 to May 2003), and 2367 with ultrasound guidance (ultrasound group, June 2003 to May 2007). All procedures were performed by the same team of intensivists. Comparison criteria included procedural data, complications, patient's comfort, and perceptions. Variables were analyzed with Student's t test and chi(2) test. Multivariate analysis was performed according to the Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: Using ultrasound guidance, we noted a significant reduction in procedure time in both port (mean difference 4.9 +/- 0.4 minutes, confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 5.7) and tunneled catheter (mean difference 2.4 +/- 0.8 minutes, CI 0.9 to 3.8) placement. The landmark method was associated with an increased risk of overall perioperative complications (4.5, CI 3.6 to 5.6). Among disease entities, acute leukemia patients had a significantly higher risk of CVC-related infections (2.6, CI 2.1 to 3.8). On the basis of questionnaires submitted to patients from both groups, ultrasound guidance was associated with improved patient comfort and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound guidance reduces complications and improves patient comfort. Further studies are needed to define whether acute leukemia patients should be considered a separate category with regard to the higher incidence of infections.","['Peris, Adriano', 'Zagli, Giovanni', 'Bonizzoli, Manuela', 'Cianchi, Giovanni', 'Ciapetti, Marco', 'Spina, Rosario', 'Anichini, Valentina', 'Lapi, Francesco', 'Batacchi, Stefano']","['Peris A', 'Zagli G', 'Bonizzoli M', 'Cianchi G', 'Ciapetti M', 'Spina R', 'Anichini V', 'Lapi F', 'Batacchi S']","['Anesthesia and Intensive Care Unit of Emergency Department, Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100909,United States,Anesth Analg,Anesthesia and analgesia,1310650,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arteries/injuries', 'Catheter-Related Infections/etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects/*instrumentation', '*Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Equipment Design', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hematoma/etiology', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Satisfaction', 'Pneumothorax/etiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Ultrasonography, Interventional', 'Venous Thrombosis/etiology', 'Wounds, Penetrating/etiology']",2010/09/11 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ANE.0b013e3181f333c1 [pii]', '10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181f333c1 [doi]']",ppublish,Anesth Analg. 2010 Nov;111(5):1194-201. doi: 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181f333c1.

Of the Notch receptors, Notch1 is a recurrent target of gain-of-function mutations and Notch3 is expressed in all T-ALLs, but it is currently unclear how these receptors contribute to T-cell transformation in vivo. We investigated the role of Notch1 and Notch3 in T-ALL progression by a genetic approach, in mice bearing a knockdown mutation in the Ikaros gene that spontaneously develop Notch-dependent T-ALL. While deletion of Notch3 has little effect, T cell-specific deletion of floxed Notch1 promoter/exon 1 sequences significantly accelerates leukemogenesis. Notch1-deleted tumors lack surface Notch1 but express gamma-secretase-cleaved intracellular Notch1 proteins. In addition, these tumors accumulate high levels of truncated Notch1 transcripts that are caused by aberrant transcription from cryptic initiation sites in the 3' part of the gene. Deletion of the floxed sequences directly reprograms the Notch1 locus to begin transcription from these 3' promoters and is accompanied by an epigenetic reorganization of the Notch1 locus that is consistent with transcriptional activation. Further, spontaneous deletion of 5' Notch1 sequences occurs in approximately 75% of Ikaros-deficient T-ALLs. These results reveal a novel mechanism for the oncogenic activation of the Notch1 gene after deletion of its main promoter.","['Jeannet, Robin', 'Mastio, Jerome', 'Macias-Garcia, Alejandra', 'Oravecz, Attila', 'Ashworth, Todd', 'Geimer Le Lay, Anne-Solen', 'Jost, Bernard', 'Le Gras, Stephanie', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Gridley, Thomas', 'Honjo, Tasuku', 'Radtke, Freddy', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Chan, Susan', 'Kastner, Philippe']","['Jeannet R', 'Mastio J', 'Macias-Garcia A', 'Oravecz A', 'Ashworth T', 'Geimer Le Lay AS', 'Jost B', 'Le Gras S', 'Ghysdael J', 'Gridley T', 'Honjo T', 'Radtke F', 'Aster JC', 'Chan S', 'Kastner P']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100909,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch3 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rbpj protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60339-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-286658 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 16;116(25):5443-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-286658.

In representative patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we here demonstrate that recently activated presumably short-lived plasmablasts expressing HLA-DR(high) and Ki-67 continuously circulate in peripheral blood after B-cell depletion by rituximab at 26%-119% of their initial numbers. They circulate independent of splenectomy, express immunoglobulin A (IgA), beta(7) integrin, and C-C motif receptor 10 (CCR10) and migrate along CCL28 gradients in vitro, suggesting their mucosal origin. These plasmablasts express somatically hypermutated V(H) gene rearrangements and spontaneously secrete IgA, exhibiting binding to microbial antigens. Notably, IgA(+) plasmablasts and plasma cells were identified in the lamina propria of patients treated with rituximab during peripheral B-cell depletion. Although a relation of these ""steady state""-like plasmablasts with rheumatoid arthritis activity could not be found, their persistence during B-cell depletion indicates that their precursors, that is, B cells resident in the mucosa are not deleted by this treatment. These data suggest that a population of mucosal B cells is self-sufficient in adult humans and not replenished by CD20(+) B cells immigrating from blood, lymphoid tissue, or bone marrow, that is, B cells depleted by rituximab.","['Mei, Henrik E', 'Frolich, Daniela', 'Giesecke, Claudia', 'Loddenkemper, Christoph', 'Reiter, Karin', 'Schmidt, Stefanie', 'Feist, Eugen', 'Daridon, Capucine', 'Tony, Hans-Peter', 'Radbruch, Andreas', 'Dorner, Thomas']","['Mei HE', 'Frolich D', 'Giesecke C', 'Loddenkemper C', 'Reiter K', 'Schmidt S', 'Feist E', 'Daridon C', 'Tony HP', 'Radbruch A', 'Dorner T']","['German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin (DRFZ), Berlin, Germany. mei@drfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100909,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin A', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Mucous Membrane/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*pathology', 'Rituximab']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60199-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-266536 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 9;116(24):5181-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-266536.

One mechanism of deregulating the apoptotic pathway is through overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members. ABT-263 (navitoclax) is a first-in-class BCL2 family inhibitor that restores the ability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. However, many cancer cells are resistant to ABT-263 due to high levels of a BCL2 family member, MCL1, which is not targeted by the drug. MCL1 expression is regulated transcriptionally, translationally, and through proteasome-mediated degradation. Recently, MCL1 expression was shown to be affected by microRNAs (miRNA). To identify miRNAs that modulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to ABT-263, we screened a library of 810 human miRNA mimics in HCT-116 cells in the presence of ABT-263. The screen revealed 19 miRNAs that sensitize HCT-116 cells to ABT-263. Fifteen of these miRNAs were also shown to sensitize CHL1 melanoma cells to the same agent. We further evaluated 12 of the strongest sensitizers in these cell lines. We found that these sensitizers induced apoptosis only in the presence of ABT-263. In addition, whereas all 12 of these miRNAs reduced MCL1 protein expression, only 10 of them targeted MCL1 through direct binding to the 3'-untranslated region of the gene, raising the possibility that other resistance regulators of MCL1 expression may be identified using our method. Finally, because sensitizing miRNA expression is lower in tumors compared with normal tissues, our data can facilitate the design of miRNA replacement therapies to increase sensitivity to BCL2 antagonists.","['Lam, Lloyd T', 'Lu, Xin', 'Zhang, Haichao', 'Lesniewski, Rick', 'Rosenberg, Saul', 'Semizarov, Dimitri']","['Lam LT', 'Lu X', 'Zhang H', 'Lesniewski R', 'Rosenberg S', 'Semizarov D']","['Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott, Building AP-10, Department R4CD, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA.

The SAR studies revealed that both the nature of the nitrogen substituent into the quinone ring and the methyl group at the 6-position play key roles in the antitumor activity.","['Vasquez, David', 'Rodriguez, Jaime A', 'Theoduloz, Cristina', 'Calderon, Pedro Buc', 'Valderrama, Jaime A']","['Vasquez D', 'Rodriguez JA', 'Theoduloz C', 'Calderon PB', 'Valderrama JA']","['Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 6094411, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100821,France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinones)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorimetry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Quinones/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0223-5234(10)00618-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2010.08.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2010 Nov;45(11):5234-42. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2010.08.040.

METHODS: 95 patients with ATLL seen at our institution between 1987 and 2008 were included. Clinical data were compared, according to ATLL variant, using the Mann-Whitney and the Chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazard test were used for the univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years with male-to-female ratio of 1.07:1. Patients with acute ATLL were more likely to present with bone marrow, liver and spleen involvement, higher beta2-microglobulin and lower albumin levels. Poor performance status, high IPI score, presence of B symptoms, high LDH and low albumin levels were associated with a worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL. High LDH, high beta2-microglobulin and high PIT score were associated with worse survival in acute ATLL. In the multivariate analysis, low albumin level and presence of B symptoms were independent factors for worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL, and high beta2-microglobulin level was independent factor for worse survival in acute ATLL. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive ATLL variants have a distinct, almost mutually exclusive profile of prognostic factors.","['Beltran, Brady', 'Quinones, Pilar', 'Morales, Domingo', 'Cotrina, Esther', 'Castillo, Jorge J']","['Beltran B', 'Quinones P', 'Morales D', 'Cotrina E', 'Castillo JJ']","['Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, Lima, Peru.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100915,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Albumins/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/05/18 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00407-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Mar;35(3):334-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.08.006.

To shed further light on these mechanisms, we compared the trafficking of precursor NE (proNE) and precursor PR3 (proPR3). Like proNE [1], proPR3 interacted with CD63 upon heterologous co-expression in COS cells but endogenous interaction was not detected although cell surface proNE/proPR3/CD63 were co-endocytosed in myelomonocytic cells. Cell surface proNE/proPR3 turned over more rapidly than cell surface CD63 consistent with processing/degradation of the pro-proteases but recycling of CD63. Colocalization of proNE/proPR3/CD63 with clathrin and Rab 7 suggested trafficking through coated vesicles and late endosomes. Partial caveolar trafficking of proNE/CD63 but not proPR3 was suggested by colocalization with caveolin-1. Blocking the C-terminus of proNE/proPR3 by creating a fusion with FK506 binding protein inhibited endosomal re-uptake of proNE but not proPR3 indicating ""pro(C)""-peptide-dependent structural/conformational requirements for proNE but not for proPR3 endocytosis. The NE aminoacid residue Y199 of a proposed NE sorting motif that interacts with AP-3 [2] was not required for proNE processing, sorting or endocytosis in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells expressing heterologous Y199-deleted proNE; this suggests operation of another AP-3-link for proNE targeting. Our results show intracellular multi-step trafficking to be different between proNE and proPR3 consistent with their differential subcellular NE/PR3 localization in neutrophils.","['Kallquist, Linda', 'Rosen, Hanna', 'Nordenfelt, Pontus', 'Calafat, Jero', 'Janssen, Hans', 'Persson, Ann-Maj', 'Hansson, Markus', 'Olsson, Inge']","['Kallquist L', 'Rosen H', 'Nordenfelt P', 'Calafat J', 'Janssen H', 'Persson AM', 'Hansson M', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Hematology, BMC C14, Lund University, SE-221 84 Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 3)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD63 protein, human)', '0 (Cd63 protein, rat)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 3/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Endocytosis', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/enzymology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloblastin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/pathology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Tetraspanin 30', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2010/09/11 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00410-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Nov 15;316(19):3182-96. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.08.016.

A multistep procedure was implemented to extract eicosanoids and other bioactive lipids from the biological matrix, chromatographically separate them using fast reversed-phase liquid chromatography, tentatively identify new candidate eicosanoids through a matching process of retention times, isotope distribution patterns, and high-resolution orbitrap MS/MS fragmentation patterns, and subsequently quantify tentative candidates by means of analytical reference standards. Key new aspects of this profiling technique included the classification of bioactive lipids into 12 groups according to their calculated exact masses and the development of optimized liquid chromatographic conditions for these groups to achieve sufficient separation of the numerous isobaric and isomeric species, many of which exhibited virtually identical collision-induced dissociation behavior. Importantly, no analytical standards were required at this screening stage of the assay, and tentative identifications were achieved by matching results to selected reference species from each of the groups. The analytical figures of merit for the orbitrap assay such as linear dynamic range, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and precision demonstrated that the performance of the assay was very similar to that of a quadrupole linear ion trap assay, which was used for validation purposes. The method allowed us to examine eicosanoid profiles within the signaling cascade in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells under basal conditions and following arachidonic acid stimulation. The preliminary screening based on high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data along with isotope pattern and retention time matching revealed the presence of 15 bioactive lipids, belonging to a range of prostaglandin, leukotriene, and hydroxy and epoxy fatty acid lipid mediators produced by CLL cells.","['Masoodi, Mojgan', 'Eiden, Michael', 'Koulman, Albert', 'Spaner, David', 'Volmer, Dietrich A']","['Masoodi M', 'Eiden M', 'Koulman A', 'Spaner D', 'Volmer DA']","['Elsie Widdowson Laboratory, Medical Research Council, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,['0 (Eicosanoids)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Chromatography, Reverse-Phase/*methods', 'Eicosanoids/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization/*methods']",2010/09/11 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac1015563 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2010 Oct 1;82(19):8176-85. doi: 10.1021/ac1015563.,"['MC_EX_G0800783/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '190633/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work demonstrates that a variety of structures can effectively target the Bcr-Abl myristate binding site and provides new leads for developing drugs that can target this binding site.","['Deng, Xianming', 'Okram, Barun', 'Ding, Qiang', 'Zhang, Jianming', 'Choi, Yongmun', 'Adrian, Francisco J', 'Wojciechowski, Amy', 'Zhang, Guobao', 'Che, Jianwei', 'Bursulaya, Badry', 'Cowan-Jacob, Sandra W', 'Rummel, Gabriele', 'Sim, Taebo', 'Gray, Nathanael S']","['Deng X', 'Okram B', 'Ding Q', 'Zhang J', 'Choi Y', 'Adrian FJ', 'Wojciechowski A', 'Zhang G', 'Che J', 'Bursulaya B', 'Cowan-Jacob SW', 'Rummel G', 'Sim T', 'Gray NS']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2010/09/11 06:00,2010/11/10 06:00,['2010/09/11 06:00'],"['2010/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm100555f [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2010 Oct 14;53(19):6934-46. doi: 10.1021/jm100555f.,"['R01 CA130876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA130876-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2951064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LNA probe hybridisation yields highly accurate signals able to discriminate between single nucleotide differences and hence between closely related miRNA family members. DIG-labelled LNA probes for mature miRNAs are detected using an anti-DIG fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated antibody and the fluorescent signals visualised with a confocal microscope, which permits the spatial localisation of the miRNAs. Using LNA-FISH, we visualised the spatial localisation of two mature miRNAs, miR-127 and miR-154, in primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) suspension cells, and thus, we confirmed their expression in a specific leukaemic subtype as measured by real-time PCR.","['Debernardi, Silvana', 'Dixon-McIver, Amanda']","['Debernardi S', 'Dixon-McIver A']","['Medical Oncology Centre, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Institute of Cancer, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/instrumentation/methods', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemistry/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/09/10 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-811-9_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;667:33-45. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-811-9_3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The screening of these aminosteroids revealed interesting structure-activity relationships. In library A, the compounds bearing a tetrahydroisoquinolone residue as the first element of diversity showed potent cytotoxicity, principally when isovaleric or cyclohexyl acetic acid was used as a capping group (>40% of cell growth inhibition at 1 muM). In library B, the phenylalanine (Phe) derivatives bearing a cyano group induced a higher growth inhibition than the other Phe derivatives. The screening of library C indicated the increase of hydrophobicity of proline (Pro) seems to preserve the cytotoxic effect achieved by the lead compound. However, the synthesis of structural Pro variants (library D) clearly shows weaker activities when compared to L-Pro building blocks. Finally, by incorporating some of the most active AA of libraries A-D in library E, we observed that the amide coupling functionality gave stronger cytotoxic activity compared to the corresponding sulfonamides or benzylamines. Six of the most active amide derivatives (E-37P, E-41P, E-42P, E-46P, E-48F, and E-12T) were selected and IC(50) determined on HL-60 cells as well as on normal human lymphocytes.

However, recent evidence suggests that hepatitis B virus (HBV) persists in a latent state even in those with mounted protective antibodies. After significant immunosuppression, anti-HBs may decrease and HBsAg may reappear (reverse seroconversion). Reverse seroconversion of HBV has been observed in association with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, renal transplantation, intensive chemotherapy, human immunodeficiency infection, or rituximab usage. CASE REPORT: We present here a case study of a patient with a previous high titer of anti-HBs who later developed HBV reactivation following intensive chemotherapy for leukemia.

In this study, we investigated the basis of this chemoresistance by applying the 'side population' (SP) analysis to blood samples from B-CLL patients. We report the existence of few natural SP cells, which harbors phenotypic and cytogenetic hallmarks of B-CLL in most patients with this disease (n=22). SP cells appeared resistant to conventional B-CLL treatments, such as Fludarabine, Bendamustin or Rituximab. Indeed, treatment with Fludarabine (16/18 cases) or Bendamustin (5/7 cases) resulted in complete elimination of non-SP, whereas cells displaying the SP phenotype were the only surviving. Although some B-CLL SP cells were innately chemoresistant, chemotherapy by Fludarabine selected not only innate SP cells but also induced some acquired SP cells, which arose from non-SP by drug-driven evolution. This SP selection by chemotherapeutic treatments is further supported by the overall increase of the SP percentage in patients who experienced chemotherapy in the preceding year. Functionally, proliferative stimulation of SP cells was able to partially replenish in vitro the non-SP cell compartment of the B-CLL disease. The chemoresistance of B-CLL relies, in our model, on the cellular heterogeneity of B-CLL SP cells and on their regenerating dynamics.","['Gross, E', ""L'Faqihi-Olive, F-E"", 'Ysebaert, L', 'Brassac, M', 'Struski, S', 'Kheirallah, S', 'Fournie, J-J', 'Laurent, G', 'Quillet-Mary, A']","['Gross E', ""L'Faqihi-Olive FE"", 'Ysebaert L', 'Brassac M', 'Struski S', 'Kheirallah S', 'Fournie JJ', 'Laurent G', 'Quillet-Mary A']","['INSERM, U563, Toulouse, F-31300 France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100909,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis/deficiency', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Coloring Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2010/09/10 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1885-92. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.176.

The hallmark of t(6;9) AML is the expression of the DEK/CAN fusion protein. The leukemogenic potential of DEK/CAN has been called into question, because it was shown to be unable to block the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. We found that DEK/CAN initiated leukemia from a small subpopulation within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population expressing a surface marker pattern of long-term (LT) HSC. The propagation of established DEK/CAN-positive leukemia was not restricted to the LT-HSC population, but occurred even from more mature and heterogeneous cell populations. This finding indicates that in DEK/CAN-induced leukemia, there is a difference between 'leukemia-initiating cells' (L-ICs) and 'leukemia-maintaining cells' (L-MCs). In contrast to the L-IC cells represented by a very rare subpopulation of LT-HSC, the L-MC seem to be represented by a larger and phenotypically heterogeneous cell population.","['Oancea, C', 'Ruster, B', 'Henschler, R', 'Puccetti, E', 'Ruthardt, M']","['Oancea C', 'Ruster B', 'Henschler R', 'Puccetti E', 'Ruthardt M']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100909,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (DEK protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2010/09/10 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010180 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.180 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1910-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.180.

Central nervous system involvement is rare and of those cases described, most are complications of acute myelogenous leukemia. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia presented with seizure and encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed temporal T2 hyperintensities with gyriform cortical enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis and elevated protein. Electroencephalography demonstrated periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. Acyclovir was initiated for herpes simplex encephalitis, however, follow-up MRI showed extension of the lesion. MR spectroscopy suggested tumor, confirmed by brain biopsy. Postradiation MRI showed a significant decrease in lesion size.

PD-1 is encountered on tumor cells of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and is a postulated diagnostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL). Recent data suggest prognostic importance of PD-1 in follicular lymphoma (FL). We assessed the diagnostic potential and the prognostic importance of PD-1 in B-cell lymphomas. METHODS: Distribution of PD-1+ lymphocytes in B-cell lymphomas was studied on 403 cases. Correlation with known biologic and clinical key data was performed. Prognostic cut-off scores were determined by receiver operating curve analysis. RESULTS: PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were numerous in extranodal marginal zone lymphomas and FL. Their amount decreased from FL grade 1 to grade 3 and to FL with transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. An increased amount of PD-1 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes above the prognostic cut-off score (> 2.8%) was a positive prognostic factor of disease-specific survival (DSS) in FL-patients. Five percent of the studied 66 CLL/SLL cases showed unequivocal PD-1 positivity of neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Increased number of PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with significantly improved DSS in FL and may be useful to predict its heterogeneous clinical behavior.

PML NB formation requires the covalent modification of PML to SUMO. The noncovalent interactions of SUMO with PML based on the identification of a SUMO-interacting motif within PML seem to be required for further recruitment within PML NBs of SUMOylated proteins. RNA viruses whose replication takes place in the cytoplasm and is inhibited by PML have developed various strategies to counteract the antiviral defense mediated by PML NBs. We show here that primary fibroblasts derived from PML knockout mice are more sensitive to infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), suggesting that the absence of PML results in an increase in EMCV replication. Also, we found that EMCV induces a decrease in PML protein levels both in interferon-treated cells and in PMLIII-expressing cells. Reduction of PML was carried out by the EMCV 3C protease. Indeed, at early times postinfection, EMCV induced PML transfer from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear matrix and PML conjugation to SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, leading to an increase in PML body size where the viral protease 3C and the proteasome component were found colocalizing with PML within the NBs. This process was followed by PML degradation occurring in a proteasome- and SUMO-dependent manner and did not involve the SUMO-interacting motif of PML. Together, these findings reveal a new mechanism evolved by EMCV to antagonize the PML pathway in the interferon-induced antiviral defense.","['El McHichi, Bouchra', 'Regad, Tarik', 'Maroui, Mohamed-Ali', 'Rodriguez, Manuel S', 'Aminev, Aleksey', 'Gerbaud, Sylvie', 'Escriou, Nicolas', 'Dianoux, Laurent', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K']","['El McHichi B', 'Regad T', 'Maroui MA', 'Rodriguez MS', 'Aminev A', 'Gerbaud S', 'Escriou N', 'Dianoux L', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100908,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cardiovirus Infections/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Transport', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/09/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01321-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01321-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Nov;84(22):11634-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01321-10.

The PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling pathway is a significant contributor to disease in various human cancers, including hematologic malignancies. Here we discuss different strategies to inhibit TOR for the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. The TOR enzyme exists in two complexes in cells, TORC1 and TORC2. The majority of preclinical and clinical efforts to target TOR have involved using rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs), which suppress TORC1 only partially and do not acutely inhibit TORC2. A new class of small molecules targeting the ATP-binding site of the TOR kinase, termed active-site TOR inhibitors (asTORi), achieves greater inhibition of both TOR complexes, resulting in broader suppression of the PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling network. Preclinical evidence suggests that asTORi have greater efficacy than rapalogs in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in T-cell lymphoma. These agents also show greater tolerability in animal models relative to rapalogs or inhibitors of PI3K. These findings encourage broader evaluation of asTORi efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, myeloma, and other blood cancers.","['Vu, Collin', 'Fruman, David A']","['Vu C', 'Fruman DA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California-Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100908,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2010/09/10 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0480 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0480 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 15;16(22):5374-80. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0480.

In spite of the importance of the problem, the actual mechanisms that control the evolution of drug resistance are not fully understood. Many attempts to study drug resistance have been made in the mathematical modeling literature. Clearly, in order to understand drug resistance, it is imperative to have a good model of the underlying dynamics of cancer cells. One of the main ingredients that has been recently introduced into the rapidly growing pool of mathematical cancer models is stem cells. Surprisingly, this all-so-important subset of cells has not been fully integrated into existing mathematical models of drug resistance. In this work we incorporate the various possible ways in which a stem cell may divide into the study of drug resistance. We derive a previously undescribed estimate of the probability of developing drug resistance by the time a tumor is detected and calculate the expected number of resistant cancer stem cells at the time of tumor detection. To demonstrate the significance of this approach, we combine our previously undescribed mathematical estimates with clinical data that are taken from a recent six-year follow-up of patients receiving imatinib for the first-line treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Based on our analysis we conclude that leukemia stem cells must tend to renew symmetrically as opposed to their healthy counterparts that predominantly divide asymmetrically.","['Tomasetti, Cristian', 'Levy, Doron']","['Tomasetti C', 'Levy D']","['Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Scientific Computation Program, Department of Mathematics and Center for Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modeling, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA. cristian@math.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100908,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Cell Division', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2010/09/10 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1007726107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1007726107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 28;107(39):16766-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1007726107.

RA induces cell differentiation through retinoic acid receptor (RAR) transcription factors. Because redox mechanisms influence how readily transcription factors bind to DNA response elements (RARE), the impact of small molecule (E3330) inhibition of the redox regulatory protein, apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox effector factor (APE1/Ref-1) on RAR DNA binding and function in RA-induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation and apoptosis was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The redox function of APE1 was studied using the small molecule inhibitor E3330 in HL-60 and PLB acute myeloid leukemia cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were employed to determine effect of inhibitor on APE1/Ref-1 redox signaling function. Trypan blue assays, Annexin-V/propidium iodide and CD11b staining, and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were employed to determine survival, apoptosis, and differentiation status of cells in culture. RESULTS: RARalpha binds to its RARE in a redox-dependent manner mediated by APE1/Ref-1 redox regulation. Redox-dependent RAR-RARE binding is blocked by E3330, a small molecule redox inhibitor of APE1/Ref-1. Combination treatment of RA + E3330 results in a profound hypersensitivity of myeloid leukemia cells to RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis. Additionally, redox inhibition by E3330 results in enhanced RAR target gene, BLR-1, expression in myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: The redox function of APE1/Ref-1 regulates RAR binding to its DNA RAREs influencing the response of myeloid leukemia cells to RA-induced differentiation. Targeting of APE1/Ref-1 redox function may allow manipulation of the retinoid response with therapeutic implications.","['Fishel, Melissa L', 'Colvin, E Scott', 'Luo, Meihua', 'Kelley, Mark R', 'Robertson, Kent A']","['Fishel ML', 'Colvin ES', 'Luo M', 'Kelley MR', 'Robertson KA']","['Department of Pediatrics (Section of Hematology/Oncology), Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, 980 W.

Twenty-seven out of 110 (24.5%) children suffered from non-malignant diseases (anaemia, pancytopenia, autoimmune disorders); 68/110 (61.8%) patients had developed leukaemia, malignant lymphoma or solid malignant tumours; 15/110 patients (13.6%) presented with other symptoms. At admission, B19V-specific IgM and IgG indicating acute or previous B19V-infection were observed in 5 (4.5%) and 48 patients (43.6%), respectively. B19V-DNA (10(3) -10(9) geq/mL) was detectable in serum and/or bone marrow of 22 patients (20.0%). These suffered from leukaemia (5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2), solid tumours (6), autoimmune (4) and haematological (4) disease and fever (1). During clinical observation four further leukaemia patients developed viraemia and persistent B19V-infection was observed in 13/22 DNA-positive patients. Treatment of B19V-DNA-positive cancer patients was associated with more supportive therapy involving erythrocyte and thrombocyte transfusion and/or antibiotic therapy. Acute B19V-infection has been frequently observed in paediatric patients with haematological and/or oncological disease. In patients with non-malignant diseases anaemia or autoimmune disorders were diagnosed in association with B19V-infection. Furthermore, a significant number of cancer patients displayed markers for acute, recent or persistent B19V-infection. This association may be strengthened by frequent treatment with blood products combined with therapeutic immune suppression. In B19V-infected cancer patients supportive therapy was more complex.","['Jitschin, R', 'Peters, O', 'Plentz, A', 'Turowski, P', 'Segerer, H', 'Modrow, S']","['Jitschin R', 'Peters O', 'Plentz A', 'Turowski P', 'Segerer H', 'Modrow S']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitat Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110303,England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/blood', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*virology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/*virology', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*blood/*complications', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/10 06:00,2012/03/03 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1198-743X(14)61212-X [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-0691.2010.03355.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 Sep;17(9):1336-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2010.03355.x.

This has been the case in the analysis of metabolic products of doxorubicin, a widely used fluorescent anthracycline for the treatment of tumors and leukemia. In this work, we combine high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a tandem laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection scheme for the characterization of doxorubicin and its metabolites produced in the postmitochondrial fraction prepared from Fischer 344 rat liver. LIF detection allowed quantification of the metabolic compounds while MS detection aided in the identification of the metabolites. Using this HPLC-LIF-MS methodology, the disappearance of doxorubicin and the appearance of 7-deoxydoxorubicinone and 7-deoxydoxorubicinolone were monitored over the course of 40 min. This application demonstrates the potential of the tandem LIF-MS detection scheme in quantification and characterization of biotransformations of fluorescent xenobiotics of biomedical and environmental relevance. Furthermore, this detection scheme would be particularly relevant in the analysis of fluorescent analytes in complex samples and in validation of methods for the analysis of such samples that typically rely only on LIF detectors.","['Katzenmeyer, Joseph B', 'Eddy, Christopher V', 'Arriaga, Edgar A']","['Katzenmeyer JB', 'Eddy CV', 'Arriaga EA']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '116455-20-0 (7-deoxy-13-dihydroadriamycinone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB2YU5128G (7-deoxyadriamycin aglycone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*analysis/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*analysis/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', '*Lasers', 'Liver/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Naphthacenes/analysis', 'Rats']",2010/09/10 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/09/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac1011415 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2010 Oct 1;82(19):8113-20. doi: 10.1021/ac1011415.,"['T32 AG029796/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AG029796/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2989425,,,,,,['NIHMS235107'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive clinical data have shown that intensive asparaginase treatment improves clinical outcomes in childhood ALL. Three asparaginase preparations are available: the native asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (E. coli asparaginase), a pegylated form of this enzyme (PEG-asparaginase), and a product isolated from Erwinia chrysanthemi, ie, Erwinia asparaginase. Clinical hypersensitivity reactions and silent inactivation due to antibodies against E. coli asparaginase, lead to inactivation of E. coli asparaginase in up to 60% of cases. Current treatment protocols include E. coli asparaginase or PEG-asparaginase for first-line treatment of ALL. Typically, patients exhibiting sensitivity to one formulation of asparaginase are switched to another to ensure they receive the most efficacious treatment regimen possible. Erwinia asparaginase is used as a second- or third-line treatment in European and US protocols. Despite the universal inclusion of asparaginase in such treatment protocols, debate on the optimal formulation and dosage of these agents continues. This article provides an overview of available evidence for optimal use of Erwinia asparaginase in the treatment of ALL.","['Pieters, Rob', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Boos, Joachim', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Silverman, Lewis', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Goekbuget, Nicola', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Pieters R', 'Hunger SP', 'Boos J', 'Rizzari C', 'Silverman L', 'Baruchel A', 'Goekbuget N', 'Schrappe M', 'Pui CH']","[""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands. rob.pieters@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100907,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '27O7W4T232 (Spironolactone)', '76270-06-9 (spironolactone, althiazide drug combination)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Erwinia/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Spironolactone', 'Sulfonamides']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/03/16 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25489 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jan 15;117(2):238-49. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25489.

In this study, the authors compared the molecular and clinical features of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in AYAs with the same features among patients in other age groups. METHODS: One thousand eleven patients underwent initial treatment for PTC at the University of California at San Francisco. Patients were subdivided into 2 age groups: ages 15 to 39 years (the AYA group) and aged >/=40 years. Demographic, clinical, and survival data in the cohort also were compared with data from the National Cancer Instsitute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. In a subset of the study cohort, the primary tumors were analyzed by genome-wide expression analyses, genotyping for common somatic mutations, and pathway-specific gene expression arrays between the age groups. RESULTS: The percentage of women and the lymph node metastasis rate were significantly higher in the AYA group. In the AYA group, the rate of distant metastasis was lower. Disease-free survival and median overall survival were significantly higher in the AYA group. The better survival in AYA patients also was apparent in the national SEER data. An unsupervised cluster analysis of gene expression data revealed no distinct clustering by age in 96 PTC samples. The frequency and type of somatic mutations in the primary tumors did not differ significantly between age groups (the AYA group vs the group aged >/=40 years). Six genes (extracellular matrix protein 1 [ECM1], v-erb-2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 [ERBB2], urinary plasminogen activator [UPA], 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 [PFKFB2], meis homeobox 2 [MEIS2], and carbonic anhydrase II [CA2]) had significant differential expression between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of disease at presentation and the survival of patients with PTC differed between AYAs and older patients. The current results indicated that these differences may be caused by several candidate genes and that these genes are expressed differentially and may play an important role in tumor cell biology. However, no distinct gene expression profiles exist for patients with PTC that distinguish between AYAs and patients aged >/=40 years.","['Vriens, Menno R', 'Moses, Willieford', 'Weng, Julie', 'Peng, Miao', 'Griffin, Ann', 'Bleyer, Archie', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Indelicato, Daniel J', 'Hwang, Jimmy', 'Kebebew, Electron']","['Vriens MR', 'Moses W', 'Weng J', 'Peng M', 'Griffin A', 'Bleyer A', 'Pollock BH', 'Indelicato DJ', 'Hwang J', 'Kebebew E']","['Department of Surgery, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/03/16 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25369 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jan 15;117(2):259-67. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25369.

In ALL patients, none of the polymorphisms demonstrated a statistically significant association with ALL after correcting for multiple comparisons. Gender-stratified analysis showed that in girls, GSTT1-null genotype was associated with increased ALL risk (OR = 2.20; p = 0.027), while GSTP1 1578AG genotype was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.43; p = 0.031). Strong linkage disequilibrium between the MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C polymorphisms was observed (D' = 1.0; r(2) = 0.072). The haplotypes 677C-1298C and 677T-1298A were associated with a reduced risk of ALL (OR = 0.68 and 0.64, respectively; gender-adjusted global p = 0.028). Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was employed to identify potential high-order gene-gene interactions and cluster subjects into susceptibility groups. SLC19A1 80G > A emerged as the predominant polymorphism associated with risk of ALL. Individuals simultaneously carrying MTHFR 1298AA, 3'-TYMS 6bp deletion(s) and SLC19A1 80A-allele(s) were at higher disease risk (OR = 2.21; p < 0.001). On the contrary, simultaneous possession of MTHFR 1298CC, 3'-TYMS 6bp homozygosity and SLC19A1 80A-allele(s) conferred lower risk (OR = 0.25; p = 0.004). Carriage of NQO1 609C-allele amongst SLC19A1 80GG genotype was associated with lower risk (OR = 0.47; p = 0.003).

However, limitations in detection sensitivity inherently restrict the method, sometimes resulting in the inability to measure proteins of very low abundance or to differentiate cells expressing subtly different protein concentrations. To improve these measurements, an enzymatic amplification approach called tyramide signal amplification (TSA) was optimized for assessment of intracellular kinase cascades. First, Pacific Blue, Pacific Orange, and Alexa Fluor 488 tyramide reporters were shown to exhibit low nonspecific binding in permeabilized cells. Next, the effects of antibody concentration, tyramide concentration, and reaction time on assay resolution were characterized. Use of optimized TSA resulted in a 10-fold or greater improvement in measurement resolution of endogenous Erk and Stat cell signaling pathways relative to standard, nonamplified detection. TSA also enhanced assay sensitivity and, in conjunction with fluorescent cell barcoding, improved assay performance according to a metric used to evaluate high-throughput drug screens.

Dasatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a promising agent for the treatment of Ph-ALL. We report on a Ph-ALL patient who relapsed early after the first allogeneic HSCT, but achieved complete molecular remission with dasatinib alone. She remains in molecular remission 12 months after the second allogeneic HSCT. Dasatinib was generally well tolerated, but she developed myalgia, nausea and positive cytomegalovirus antigenemia. In addition, sudden-onset bloody diarrhea was observed 10 days after the second HSCT, which was possibly associated with the use of dasatinib in addition to the effect of the conditioning regimen and graft-versus-host disease. In conclusion, dasatinib is an effective agent for Ph-ALL with a poor prognosis, but may be associated with specific adverse events including opportunistic infection and gastrointestinal bleeding.","['Ishida, Yoko', 'Terasako, Kiriko', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Sakamoto, Kana', 'Ashizawa, Masahiro', 'Sato, Miki', 'Kikuchi, Misato', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Okuda, Shinya', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Yamazaki, Rie', 'Nishida, Junji', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Ishida Y', 'Terasako K', 'Oshima K', 'Sakamoto K', 'Ashizawa M', 'Sato M', 'Kikuchi M', 'Kimura S', 'Nakasone H', 'Okuda S', 'Kako S', 'Yamazaki R', 'Nishida J', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Omiya-ku, Saitama, Saitama, 330-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100908,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*prevention & control/surgery', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0678-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Oct;92(3):542-6. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0678-6.

Aberrations of BCL11B locus leading to abnormal gene transcription were identified in human hematological disorders and corresponding animal models. Recently, the elevated levels of Bcl11b protein have been described in a subset of squameous cell carcinoma cases. Despite the rapidly accumulating knowledge concerning Bcl11b biology, the contribution of this protein to normal or transformed cell homeostasis remains open. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, by employing an overexpression strategy we revealed formerly unidentified features of Bcl11b. Two different T-cell lines were forced to express BCL11B at levels similar to those observed in primary T-cell leukemias. This resulted in markedly increased resistance to radiomimetic drugs while no influence on death-receptor apoptotic pathway was observed. Apoptosis resistance triggered by BCL11B overexpression was accompanied by a cell cycle delay caused by accumulation of cells at G1. This cell cycle restriction was associated with upregulation of CDKN1C (p57) and CDKN2C (p18) cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. Moreover, p27 and p130 proteins accumulated and the SKP2 gene encoding a protein of the ubiquitin-binding complex responsible for their degradation was repressed. Furthermore, the expression of the MYCN oncogene was silenced which resulted in significant depletion of the protein in cells expressing high BCL11B levels. Both cell cycle restriction and resistance to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis coincided and required the histone deacetylase binding N-terminal domain of Bcl11b. The sensitivity to genotoxic stress could be restored by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatine A. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here suggest a potential role of BCL11B in tumor survival and encourage developing Bcl11b-inhibitory approaches as a potential tool to specifically target chemoresistant tumor cells.","['Grabarczyk, Piotr', 'Nahse, Viola', 'Delin, Martin', 'Przybylski, Grzegorz', 'Depke, Maren', 'Hildebrandt, Petra', 'Volker, Uwe', 'Schmidt, Christian A']","['Grabarczyk P', 'Nahse V', 'Delin M', 'Przybylski G', 'Depke M', 'Hildebrandt P', 'Volker U', 'Schmidt CA']","['Molecular Hematology, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100902,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012532 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Sep 2;5(9). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012532.,,PMC2932720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher expression of this enzyme correlates with the degree of cell de-differentiation. We found that ME2 is expressed in K562 erythroleukemia cells, in which a number of agents have been found to induce differentiation either along the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. We found that knockdown of ME2 led to diminished proliferation of tumor cells and increased apoptosis in vitro. These findings were accompanied by differentiation of K562 cells along the erythroid lineage, as confirmed by staining for glycophorin A and hemoglobin production. ME2 knockdown also totally abolished growth of K562 cells in nude mice. Increased ROS levels, likely reflecting increased mitochondrial production, and a decreased NADPH/NADP+ ratio were noted but use of a free radical scavenger to decrease inhibition of ROS levels did not reverse the differentiation or apoptotic phenotype, suggesting that ROS production is not causally involved in the resultant phenotype. As might be expected, depletion of ME2 induced an increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio and ATP levels fell significantly. Inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle was insufficient to induce K562 differentiation. We also examined several intracellular signaling pathways and expression of transcription factors and intermediate filament proteins whose expression is known to be modulated during erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. We found that silencing of ME2 leads to phospho-ERK1/2 inhibition, phospho-AKT activation, increased GATA-1 expression and diminished vimentin expression. Metabolomic analysis, conducted to gain insight into intermediary metabolic pathways that ME2 knockdown might affect, showed that ME2 depletion resulted in high orotate levels, suggesting potential impairment of pyrimidine metabolism. Collectively our data point to ME2 as a potentially novel metabolic target for leukemia therapy.","['Ren, Jian-Guo', 'Seth, Pankaj', 'Everett, Peter', 'Clish, Clary B', 'Sukhatme, Vikas P']","['Ren JG', 'Seth P', 'Everett P', 'Clish CB', 'Sukhatme VP']","['Divisions of Interdisciplinary Medicine and Biotechnology, Hematology-Oncology and Nephrology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100902,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 1.1.1.37 (Malate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.37 (malic enzyme 2; human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Malate Dehydrogenase/*deficiency/genetics', 'Mice']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012520 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Sep 2;5(9). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012520.,"['K01 CA104700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007199/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01-CA 104700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2932743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A proteomic approach using CoIP, mono-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, allowed us to identify a total of 124 proteins that may associate with PML after irradiation. Bioinformatic analysis of the identified proteins showed that most of them were related to characterized PML functions, such as transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle regulation, cell-death regulation and response to stress. Four proteins, B23, MVP, G3BP1 and DHX9, were verified to co-localize with PML differentially before and after ionizing radiation (IR) treatment. The proteins identified in this study will significantly improve our understanding of the dynamic organization and multiple functions of PML NBs in DDR.","['Liu, Jinfeng', 'Song, Yi', 'Tian, Baolei', 'Qian, Junjie', 'Dong, Yan', 'Liu, Jilai', 'Liu, Bin', 'Sun, Zhixian']","['Liu J', 'Song Y', 'Tian B', 'Qian J', 'Dong Y', 'Liu J', 'Liu B', 'Sun Z']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, 27 Taiping Road, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Nucleus Structures/metabolism/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Proteomics', '*Transcription Factors/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism/physiology/*radiation effects/ultrastructure']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['mvq105 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvq105 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2010 Dec;148(6):659-67. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvq105.

We developed animal models of obesity and leukemia to test whether obesity could directly accelerate acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using BCR/ABL transgenic and AKR/J mice weaned onto a high-fat diet. Mice were observed until development of progressive ALL. Although obese and control BCR/ABL mice had similar median survival, older obese mice had accelerated ALL onset, implying a time-dependent effect of obesity on ALL. Obese AKR mice developed ALL significantly earlier than controls. The effect of obesity was not explained by WBC count, thymus/spleen weight, or ALL phenotype. However, obese AKR mice had higher leptin, insulin, and interleukin-6 levels than controls, and these obesity-related hormones all have potential roles in leukemia pathogenesis. In conclusion, obesity directly accelerates presentation of ALL, likely by increasing the risk of an early event in leukemogenesis. This is the first study to show that obesity can directly accelerate the progression of ALL. Thus, the observed associations between obesity and leukemia incidence are likely to be directly related to biological effects of obesity.","['Yun, Jason P', 'Behan, James W', 'Heisterkamp, Nora', 'Butturini, Anna', 'Klemm, Lars', 'Ji, Lingyun', 'Groffen, John', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Yun JP', 'Behan JW', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Butturini A', 'Klemm L', 'Ji L', 'Groffen J', 'Muschen M', 'Mittelman SD']","['Division of Endocrinology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/blood', 'Age of Onset', 'Animals', 'Diet', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leptin/blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Obesity/blood/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/genetics']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-10-0087 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0087 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2010 Oct;3(10):1259-64. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0087.

We previously identified FLVCR2 to function as a receptor for FY981 feline leukemia virus (FeLV). However, the cellular function of FLVCR2 remains unresolved. Here, we report the cellular function of FLVCR2 as an importer of heme, based on the following observations. First, FLVCR2 binds to hemin-conjugated agarose, and binding is competed by free hemin. Second, mammalian cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing FLVCR2 display enhanced heme uptake. Third, heme import is reduced after the expression of FLVCR2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or after the binding of the FY981 FeLV envelope protein to the FLVCR2 receptor. Finally, cells overexpressing FLVCR2 are more sensitive to heme toxicity, a finding most likely attributable to enhanced heme uptake. Tissue expression analysis indicates that FLVCR2 is expressed in a broad range of human tissues, including liver, placenta, brain, and kidney. The identification of a cellular function for FLVCR2 will have important implications in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of Fowler syndrome and of phenotypically associated disorders.","['Duffy, Simon P', 'Shing, Jennifer', 'Saraon, Punit', 'Berger, Lloyd C', 'Eiden, Maribeth V', 'Wilde, Andrew', 'Tailor, Chetankumar S']","['Duffy SP', 'Shing J', 'Saraon P', 'Berger LC', 'Eiden MV', 'Wilde A', 'Tailor CS']","['Hospital for Sick Children, Program in Cell Biology, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (FLVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Brain Diseases/metabolism/pathology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Heme/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Syndrome', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Xenopus laevis']",2010/09/09 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00690-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00690-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Nov;30(22):5318-24. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00690-10.

Unregulated activation of Notch signaling can result in excessive cellular proliferation and cancer. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The disease has a dismal prognosis and is invariably fatal. In this study, we report a high frequency of constitutively activated Notch in ATL patients. We found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human cancers. Compared with the exclusive activating frameshift mutations in the proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) domain in T-ALLs, those in ATLs have, in addition, single-substitution mutations in this domain leading to reduced CDC4/Fbw7-mediated degradation and stabilization of the intracellular cleaved form of Notch1 (ICN1). Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of Notch signaling by gamma-secretase inhibitors reduced tumor cell proliferation and tumor formation in ATL-engrafted mice. These data suggest that activated Notch may be important to ATL pathogenesis and reveal Notch1 as a target for therapeutic intervention in ATL patients.","['Pancewicz, Joanna', 'Taylor, John M', 'Datta, Abhik', 'Baydoun, Hicham H', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Pancewicz J', 'Taylor JM', 'Datta A', 'Baydoun HH', 'Waldmann TA', 'Hermine O', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Notch1/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2010/09/09 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1010722107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1010722107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 21;107(38):16619-24. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1010722107.

NKR-P1 receptors are members of the C-type lectin-related NK receptor superfamily that are conserved from rodents to humans. Identification of Clr ligands for the NKR-P1 receptors has facilitated functional analysis of MHC-independent target cell recognition by NK cells. One receptor-ligand pair, NKR-P1B:Clr-b, can mediate ""missing-self"" recognition of tumor and infected cells, but the role of this axis in sensing stressed cells remains unknown. Here, we show that Clr-b is rapidly downregulated in cells undergoing genotoxic and cellular stress at the level of both RNA and surface protein. Stress-mediated loss of Clr-b on leukemia cells enhanced cytotoxicity mediated by NKR-P1B(+) NK cells. Notably, Clr-b downregulation was coordinated functionally with stress-mediated upregulation of NKG2D ligands (but not class I MHC). Our findings highlight a unique role for the MHC-independent NKR-P1B:Clr-b missing-self axis in recognition of stressed cells, and provide evidence of two independent levels of Clr-b regulation in stressed cells.","['Fine, Jason H', 'Chen, Peter', 'Mesci, Aruz', 'Allan, David S J', 'Gasser, Stephan', 'Raulet, David H', 'Carlyle, James R']","['Fine JH', 'Chen P', 'Mesci A', 'Allan DS', 'Gasser S', 'Raulet DH', 'Carlyle JR']","['Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Ocil protein, mouse)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Atr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Roscovitine', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2010/09/09 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1316 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1316 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 15;70(18):7102-13. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1316.

Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is a central component in prosurvival signaling downstream of these events. We investigated the role of Akt and its modulation by the protooncogene T-cell leukemia 1a (Tcl1a) in the survival pathways of primary CLL samples and CLL-derived prolymphocytic cell lines MEC-1 and MEC-2. Akt activation was increased by the protective presence of human bone marrow stromal cells and B-cell receptor mimicking signals but antagonized by direct Akt blockade with the novel specific inhibitor AiX, with preferential apoptosis induction in CLL cells with an unmutated immunoglobulin status, which predicts poor clinical outcome. In addition, we found a direct interaction of Akt with Tcl1a in an endogenous coimmunoprecipitation assay. Confirming the critical role of Tcl1a in modulating Akt signaling, Akt activation was enhanced by overexpressing Tcl1a in CLL. In contrast, decreasing Tcl1a levels by small interfering RNA reduced Akt activation in the fludarabine-insensitive CLL cell line MEC-2 and sensitized the malignant cells to fludarabine treatment. In summary, our data reveal a significant role for the Akt-Tcl1a axis in CLL survival and propose a further evaluation of this interplay for targeting chemoresistance phenomena.","['Hofbauer, Sebastian W', 'Pinon, Josefina D', 'Brachtl, Gabriele', 'Haginger, Lucia', 'Wang, Wei', 'Johrer, Karin', 'Tinhofer, Ingeborg', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Greil, Richard']","['Hofbauer SW', 'Pinon JD', 'Brachtl G', 'Haginger L', 'Wang W', 'Johrer K', 'Tinhofer I', 'Hartmann TN', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, University Clinics of Internal Medicine III with Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Oxazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2010/09/09 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-4411 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4411 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 15;70(18):7336-44. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4411.

In addition, FOXM1 has been reported to contribute to oncogenesis in various cancers. However, it is not clearly understood how FOXM1 contributes to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecular function of FOXM1 in AML cells. The FOXM1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expressed in AML cell lines was predominantly the FOXM1B isoform, and its levels were significantly higher than in normal high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(hi)) cells. Reduction of FOXM1 expression in AML cells inhibited cell proliferation compared with control cells, through induction of G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, a decrease in the protein expression of Aurora kinase B, Survivin, Cyclin B1, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 and Cdc25B and an increase in the protein expression of p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). FOXM1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was overexpressed in all 127 AML clinical specimens tested (n = 21, 56, 32 and 18 for M1, M2, M4 and M5 subtypes, respectively). Compared with normal ALDH(hi) cells, FOXM1 gene expression was 1.65- to 2.26-fold higher in AML cells. Moreover, the FOXM1 protein was more strongly expressed in AML-derived ALDH(hi) cells compared with normal ALDH(hi) cells. In addition, depletion of FOXM1 reduced colony formation of AML-derived ALDH(hi) cells due to inhibition of Cdc25B and Cyclin B1 expression. In summary, we found that FOXM1B mRNA is predominantly expressed in AML cells and that aberrant expression of FOXM1 induces AML cell proliferation through modulation of cell cycle progression. Thus, inhibition of FOXM1 expression represents an attractive target for AML therapy.","['Nakamura, Satoki', 'Hirano, Isao', 'Okinaka, Keiji', 'Takemura, Tomonari', 'Yokota, Daisuke', 'Ono, Takaaki', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Shibata, Kiyoshi', 'Fujisawa, Shinya', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Nakamura S', 'Hirano I', 'Okinaka K', 'Takemura T', 'Yokota D', 'Ono T', 'Shigeno K', 'Shibata K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Ohnishi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan. satonaka@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin B1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Disease Progression', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survivin']",2010/09/09 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq185 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq185 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Nov;31(11):2012-21. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq185.

A population-based study.,298-305,10.1016/j.canep.2010.08.002 [doi],"PURPOSE: Cancer in a child may adversely affect parents' work opportunities due to enlarged care burdens and/or altered priorities. Few studies exist, and possible effects on parental employment and earnings were therefore explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the entire Norwegian population aged 27-65 with children under the age of 20 in 1990-2002 (N=1.2 million) was retrieved from national registries. Employment rates for parents of 3263 children with cancer were compared to those of parents with children without cancer by means of logistic regression models. Log-linear regression models were used to explore childhood cancer's effect on parental earnings for the large majority of parents who remained employed. RESULTS: Cancer in a child was in general not associated with a reduced risk of employment, although some exceptions exist among both mothers and fathers. For employed mothers, CNS cancers, germinal cell cancers, and unspecified leukemia were associated with significant reductions in earnings (10%, 21%, and 60%, respectively). Reductions were particularly pronounced for mothers with a young and alive child, and became more pronounced with time elapsed from diagnosis. Fathers' earnings were not affected significantly. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Parents' employment is not adversely affected by a child's cancer in Norway. Earnings are reduced in certain instances, but the overall effects are minor. Generous welfare options and flexible labor markets typical for Nordic welfare states may account for this. In line with traditional caregiving responsibilities, reductions in earnings were most pronounced for mothers.","['Syse, Astri', 'Larsen, Inger Kristin', 'Tretli, Steinar']","['Syse A', 'Larsen IK', 'Tretli S']","['Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway. astri.syse@kreftregisteret.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100906,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Employment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/economics/*epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', '*Parents', 'Registries', 'Salaries and Fringe Benefits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(10)00152-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2010.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2011 Jun;35(3):298-305. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2010.08.002.

The aim of this study was to document engraftment and to detect as soon as possible relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia who underwent stem cell transplantation. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a highly sensitive and reproducible technology. It is useful in some disease to target selected sub-populations in order to have an earlier detection of relapse on cell fractions. In the acute myeloid leukaemia (n=65), analysis of the chimerism on whole peripheral blood cells and bone marrow cells, CD3+ cells, specific myeloid CD33+ cells (from blood) and CD34+ cells (from bone marrow) is of importance. After transplant, 25 patients relapsed (38%), three massively, with chimerism detection in whole blood and bone marrow and 22 insidiously following two different schemes (GRI and GRII). In GRI, (n=13): chimerism of CD33+ and CD34+ cellular fractions allowed an early detection of relapse in 100% of cases undetected in whole cells whereas in GRII (n=9): myeloid cells could identified relapse in 89% of cases when whole blood cells and CD3+ cells expressed a mixed chimerism. This study highlighted the importance of sub-cellular population chimerism documentation enable to ascertain a stable engraftment and to detect early relapse.

About 85% of children with ALL are leukaemia free at 5 years, but at best, only about 40% adults with 'standard risk' ALL remain in remission at that time. This is in spite of almost an equal proportion of adult patients achieving a complete remission as their much younger counterparts. Current data supports the efficacy of asparaginase in the treatment of ALL. PURPOSE: This review focuses on the role of asparaginase in the management of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It examines the current use of this agent in this disease and the potential for optimising its application and monitoring of efficacy in treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: Use of L-asparaginase has revolutionised the anti-leukaemia therapy in ALL. Early and sustained asparagine depletion, at least up to the first 30 weeks of therapy, appears to be crucial. Given the clear correlation between the depth of asparagine depletion and the patient outcome, asparaginase therapy should be monitored for adequate asparagine depletion for achievement of optimum results.","['Patil, Sushrut', 'Coutsouvelis, John', 'Spencer, Andrew']","['Patil S', 'Coutsouvelis J', 'Spencer A']","['Department of Malignant Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, The Alfred Hospital, Commercial Road, Melbourne 3004, Australia. s.patil@alfred.org.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100906,Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(10)00137-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2011 May;37(3):202-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.08.002.

Therefore, the development of a simple purification method attracts the attention of retroviral drug and enzyme researchers and manufacturers. The present work is the first purification example of a non-tagged (native) RT by affinity chromatography using synthetic affinity ligands. In this study, the ligand was selected from a structure-biased combinatorial library of dNTP-mimetic ligands, and it was evaluated for its ability to bind and purify M-MLVH- RT from inclusion bodies of recombinant E. coli. The selected ligand (AEAd), bearing 9-aminoethyladenine and 1,6-diamine-hexane both linked on the same triazine scaffold, displayed the highest enzyme purifying ability after applying mild desorption conditions (6 mM MnCl(2) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5). The binding capacity of immobilized AEAd with M-MLVH- RT was determined to be equal to approximately 1 mg enzyme/g moist weight gel.

However, filtering may introduce a bias on the multiple testing correction. The precise amount of bias depends on many quantities, such as fraction of probes filtered out, filter statistic and test statistic used. RESULTS: We show that a biased multiple testing correction results if non-differentially expressed probes are not filtered out with equal probability from the entire range of p-values. We illustrate our results using both a simulation study and an experimental dataset, where the FDR is shown to be biased mostly by filters that are associated with the hypothesis being tested, such as the fold change. Filters that induce little bias on the FDR yield less additional power of detecting differentially expressed genes. Finally, we propose a statistical test that can be used in practice to determine whether any chosen filter introduces bias on the FDR estimate used, given a general experimental setup. CONCLUSIONS: Filtering out of probes must be used with care as it may bias the multiple testing correction. Researchers can use our test for FDR bias to guide their choice of filter and amount of filtering in practice.","['van Iterson, Maarten', 'Boer, Judith M', 'Menezes, Renee X']","['van Iterson M', 'Boer JM', 'Menezes RX']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, 1007 MB, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-450 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-450 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Sep 7;11:450. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-450.,,PMC2949886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to confirm the predictive value of h-CLAT for skin sensitisation activity by employing a larger number of test chemicals. One hundred chemicals were selected, according to their categorisation in the local lymph node assay (LLNA), as being: extreme, strong, moderate and weak sensitisers, and non-sensitisers. The correlation of the h-CLAT results with the LLNA results was 84%. There were some false negatives (e.g. benzoyl peroxide, hexyl cinnamic aldehyde) and some false positives (e.g. 1-bromobutane, diethylphthalate). Eight out of the 9 false negatives (89%) were water-insoluble chemicals. The h-CLAT could positively predict not only extreme and strong sensitisers, but also moderate and weak sensitisers, though the detection rates of weak sensitisers and non-sensitisers were comparatively low. Some sensitisers enhanced both CD86 and CD54 levels, and some enhanced the level of only one of them. The use of the combination of CD86 and CD54 induction as a positive indicator, improved the accuracy of the test. In conclusion, the h-CLAT is expected to be a useful cell-based in vitro method for predicting skin sensitisation potential.","['Ashikaga, Takao', 'Sakaguchi, Hitoshi', 'Sono, Sakiko', 'Kosaka, Nanae', 'Ishikawa, Makie', 'Nukada, Yuko', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki', 'Ito, Yuichi', 'Nishiyama, Naohiro', 'Itagaki, Hiroshi']","['Ashikaga T', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Sono S', 'Kosaka N', 'Ishikawa M', 'Nukada Y', 'Miyazawa M', 'Ito Y', 'Nishiyama N', 'Itagaki H']","['Shiseido Co.

Although the cellular responses induced by doxorubicin treatment have been investigated for years, the precise mechanisms underlying its cytotoxicity and therapeutic activity remain unclear. Here we utilized mass spectrometry, together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to analyze comparatively the protein expression in Jurkat-T cells before and after treatment with a clinically relevant concentration of doxorubicin. We were able to quantify 1066 proteins in Jurkat-T cells with both forward and reverse SILAC measurements, among which 62 were with significantly altered levels of expression induced by doxorubicin treatment. These included the up-regulation of core histones, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, and superoxide dismutase 2 as well as the down-regulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase. The latter two are essential enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the doxorubicin-induced growth inhibition of Jurkat-T cells could be rescued by treatment with cholesterol, supporting that doxorubicin exerts its cytotoxic effect, in part, by suppressing the expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase, thereby inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol. The results from the present study provide important new knowledge for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of doxorubicin.","['Dong, Xiaoli', 'Xiong, Lei', 'Jiang, Xinning', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Dong X', 'Xiong L', 'Jiang X', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521-0403, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100923,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*drug effects/genetics', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry']",2010/09/09 06:00,2011/03/08 06:00,['2010/09/09 06:00'],"['2010/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr1007043 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2010 Nov 5;9(11):5943-51. doi: 10.1021/pr1007043.

Chloroquine is a lysosomotropic agent that has been reported to enhance in vitro cytotoxicity of basic anticancer drugs. To investigate the mechanism of chloroquine triggering basic anticancer drugs release from liposomes and the potential to treat solid tumors in clinic, daunorubicin was loaded into folate-targeted liposomes by ammonium sulfate remote loading method. In vitro triggered release profiles showed that chloroquine can instantly expel about 11% daunorubicin out of liposomes. In vitro cytotoxicity of folate-targeted liposomal daunorubicin on L1210JF(FR+) was enhanced by chloroquine, which was further confirmed by confocal micrographs. Intraliposomal pH was increased by adding chloroquine into 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) liposomes with ammonium sulfate gradient, but was not higher than 5.5. Ion exchange and pH rising are the most plausible mechanisms of chloroquine triggering daunorubicin release from liposomes. In vivo anticancer effects on a murine solid tumor model with L1210JF indicated that chloroquine induced daunorubicin release from liposomes as well. Overall, these results support the potential application of chloroquine to trigger the release of liposomal drugs and ultimately to improve the therapeutic efficacy.","['Xiong, Subin', 'Li, Hong', 'Yu, Bo', 'Wu, Jun', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Xiong S', 'Li H', 'Yu B', 'Wu J', 'Lee RJ']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, 18, Chaowang Road, Hangzhou 310032, PR China. xiongsb@zjut.edu.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arylsulfonates)', '0 (Liposomes)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'I2W85YOX9L (pyranine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Arylsulfonates/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Liposomes', '*Lysosomes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy']",2010/09/08 06:00,2011/03/03 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/jps.22210 [doi]', 'S0022-3549(15)32379-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2010 Dec;99(12):5011-8. doi: 10.1002/jps.22210.,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a fraction of cancer patients responds to the drug, and no biomarkers are available to predict tumor sensitivity. Recently, we and others have obtained evidence for potential involvement of tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) receptor protein tyrosine kinases (TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) in leukemia. In the present study, we tested the therapeutic effect of Rapamycin and its analog RAD001 on altered TRK-induced leukemia in a murine model. Daily treatment with Rapamycin (2 mg/kg) or RAD001 (1 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the survival of treated animals (n = 40) compared with the placebo group. Consistently, both mTOR and S6 proteins were strongly dephosphorylated in vitro and in vivo after treatment with Rapamycin or RAD001. However, Rapamycin did not completely inhibit mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. With exception of one mouse showing slight reactivation of Akt after treatment, no reactivation of MAPK or Akt pathways was observed in other resistant tumors. Interestingly, leukemic cells isolated from a Rapamycin-resistant mouse were still highly sensitive to Rapamycin in vitro. Our findings suggest that altered TRK signaling may be a good predictor of tumor sensitivity to mTOR inhibition and that pathways other than MAPK and Akt exist that may trigger resistance of leukemic cells to Rapamycin in vivo.","['Rhein, Mathias', 'Schwarzer, Adrian', 'Yang, Min', 'Kaever, Volkhard', 'Brugman, Martijn', 'Meyer, Johann', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Baum, Christopher', 'Li, Zhixiong']","['Rhein M', 'Schwarzer A', 'Yang M', 'Kaever V', 'Brugman M', 'Meyer J', 'Ganser A', 'Baum C', 'Li Z']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100907,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Survival Analysis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/09/08 06:00,2011/03/31 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2010/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1065-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Mar;90(3):283-92. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1065-3.

Three stacking methods with different mechanisms were combined and incorporated into CE separation. Complete stacking and sharp peaks were achieved. Firstly, the optimized buffer (60 mM phosphate containing 15% THF and 100 mM SDS) was filled into the capillary, which was followed by the higher conductivity buffer (100 mM phosphate, 2 psi for 45 s). The analytes extracted from CSF were injected at 2 psi for 99.9 s, which provided long sample zones and pH junction for focusing. Finally, the stacking step was performed by sweeping, and separation was achieved by micellar electrokinetic chromatography. The results of the linear regression equations indicated high linearity (r >/= 0.9981) over the range of 0.5-7 muM. In intra- and inter-batch results, all data of RSD and RE were below 11%, indicating good precision and accuracy of this method. The LODs (S/N = 3) were 0.1 muM for MTX, 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OHMTX) and MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-(Glu)(n, n = 2-5)), 0.2 muM for MTX-(Glu)(6), and 0.3 muM for 2,4-diamino-N(10)-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) and MTX-(Glu)(7). Our method was implemented for analysis of MTX and its metabolites in the CSF, and could be used for evaluation of its curative effects of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The data were also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results showed good coincidence.","['Cheng, Hui-Ling', 'Chiou, Shyh-Shin', 'Liao, Yu-Mei', 'Lu, Chi-Yu', 'Chen, Yen-Ling', 'Wu, Shou-Mei']","['Cheng HL', 'Chiou SS', 'Liao YM', 'Lu CY', 'Chen YL', 'Wu SM']","['School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, 100, Shi-chuan 1st Rd., Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100906,Germany,Anal Bioanal Chem,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,101134327,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Electrophoresis, Capillary/*methods', 'Humans', '*Methotrexate/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2010/09/08 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2010/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00216-010-4152-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Bioanal Chem. 2010 Nov;398(5):2183-90. doi: 10.1007/s00216-010-4152-3.

Much focus has also been placed on the development of methods that decrease the toxicity of parent compounds, specifically through the use of drug carriers such as liposomes, and on the development of new, potentially less toxic anthracycline derivatives, such as amrubicin and pixantrone.

Chronic hemolytic anemia is well known as an underlying condition. However, additional factors have been recognized to accompany parvoviral PRCA; however, there are only limited reports on iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and rituximab-induced B-cell dysfunction. We report two patients with PVB19-associated PRCA confirmed by positivity of viral DNA. Although they had no chronic hemolysis, patient 1 had IDA, and patient 2 had remitted small-lymphocytic lymphoma treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Absence of reticulocytes in peripheral blood and marked depletion of erythroid precursors in bone marrow were observed both. Whereas patient 1 received only symptomatic therapy because anemia was not severe, patient 2 was treated with steroids, as PRCA etiology was at first uncertain, and immunological PRCA was not excluded. Both showed rapid increase of reticulocyte counts and recovery from anemia. Although immunoglobulin is considered effective for parvoviral PRCA, notable adverse reactions have been reported. When anemic symptom is not severe, reticulocyte observation only is recommended. The effects of steroids should also be re-evaluated. Optimal treatment according to disease severity remains to be established.","['Kaneko, Hiroto', 'Shimura, Kazuho', 'Nishida, Koichi', 'Fujiwara, Yasunori', 'Matsumoto, Yousuke', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Yokota, Shouhei', 'Ohkawara, Yasuo', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Kaneko H', 'Shimura K', 'Nishida K', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Kuroda J', 'Horiike S', 'Yokota S', 'Ohkawara Y', 'Taniwaki M']","['Department of Hematology, Aiseikai-Yamashina Hospital, 19-4 Shichouno-cho, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto, 607-8086, Japan. hp@aiseikaihp.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100907,Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/*complications', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Parvoviridae Infections/virology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*virology', 'Rituximab']",2010/09/08 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2010/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10156-010-0106-0 [doi]', 'S1341-321X(11)70527-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2011 Apr;17(2):268-71. doi: 10.1007/s10156-010-0106-0.

This study explores an alternative HLA class II presentation pathway in leukemic blasts that involves proteasome and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-dependent peptide loading. Although HLA-DR did associate with Ii, Ii silencing in the human class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP)-negative KG-1 myeloid leukemic cell line did not affect total and plasma membrane expression levels of HLA-DR, as determined by western blotting and flow cytometry. Since HLA-DR expression does require peptide binding, we examined the role of endogenous antigen-processing machinery in HLA-DR presentation by CLIP(-) leukemic blasts. The suppression of proteasome and TAP function using various inhibitors resulted in decreased HLA-DR levels in both CLIP(-) KG-1 and ME-1 blasts. Simultaneous inhibition of TAP and Ii completely down-modulated the expression of HLA-DR, demonstrating that together these molecules form the key mediators of HLA class II antigen presentation in leukemic blasts. By the use of a proteasome- and TAP-dependent pathway for HLA class II antigen presentation, CLIP(-) leukemic blasts might be able to present a broad range of endogenous leukemia-associated peptides via HLA class II to activate leukemia-specific CD4(+) T cells.","['van Luijn, Marvin M', 'Chamuleau, Martine E D', 'Ressing, Maaike E', 'Wiertz, Emmanuel J', 'Ostrand-Rosenberg, Suzanne', 'Souwer, Yuri', 'Zevenbergen, Adri', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'van Ham, S Marieke']","['van Luijn MM', 'Chamuleau ME', 'Ressing ME', 'Wiertz EJ', 'Ostrand-Rosenberg S', 'Souwer Y', 'Zevenbergen A', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'van Ham SM']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU Institute for Cancer and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.luijn@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100905,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (invariant chain)', '0 (transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP))', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*physiology', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology']",2010/09/08 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0908-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Dec;59(12):1825-38. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0908-z.

We also sought to determine time trends and to compare the results with international studies. METHODS: We asked 11 population-based cancer registries to submit individual data for patients diagnosed from 1993 to 1999, together with data on outcome after 5 years. Although all these registries submitted data (491 772 cases), only six met the required standards for the quality of registration data and follow-up investigation. The relative 5-year survival calculated by pooling data from 151 061 cases from six registries was taken as the survival for cancer patients in Japan. RESULTS: Relative 5-year survival (1997-99) was 54.3% for all cancers (males: 50.0%, females: 59.8%). Survival figures for all sites changed slightly over the 7-year period, from 53.2% for the first 4 years of the study (1993-96) to 54.3% for the last 3 years (1997-99), however, a major improvement was observed in several primary sites. Some overall survival was lower in Japan than in the USA, but similar to that in European countries. Specifically, survival for uterine cancer, prostate cancer, testis cancer, lymphoma and leukemia was much lower in Japan than in other countries. However, survival was better in Japan mainly for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, liver and gallbladder.

The expression of CD123 may also be high in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study, the expression and clinical significance of CD123 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor (CD114) on the bone marrow cells of patients with MDS were investigated to explore the molecular marker of the malignant clone of MDS. METHODS: Forty-two patients with MDS, who were diagnosed in the Hematological Department of General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from 2008 to 2009, and twelve normal controls were enrolled in this study. Fluorescence activiated cell sorter (FACS) was used to measure the expression of CD123 on CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and CD114 on CD34(+) cells of the bone marrow of these patients and controls and the clinical significance was analyzed. The expression of CD114 on CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells was further measured to explore the molecular marker of the malignant clone in MDS. RESULTS: MDS patients displayed significantly higher proportion of CD34(+)CD38(-)/CD34(+) ((14.03 +/- 5.27)%) than normal controls ((7.70 +/- 4.36)%, P < 0.05). The expression rate of CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-)/CD34(+)CD38(-) was significantly higher in MDS patients ((48.39 +/- 28.15)%) than that in normal controls ((8.75 +/- 11.71)%, P < 0.01). The expression level of CD123 was significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow blasts (r = 0.457, P < 0.05). The expression rate of CD114(+)CD34(+)/CD34(+) was lower in MDS patients ((33.05 +/- 21.71)%) than that in normal controls ((38.99 +/- 19.07)%) but was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The expression of CD114 on CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells ((34.82 +/- 29.58)%) was significantly lower than that on CD123(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells ((53.48 +/- 27.41)%) of MDS patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MDS patients displayed higher proportion of CD34(+)CD38(-)/CD34(+) than normal controls. CD123 was highly expressed in the bone marrow of the patients with MDS, significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow blasts, and thus might be the marker of MDS malignant clone. CD123(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells exhibited lower expression of G-CSF receptors, which might partly explain why MDS clone responds worse to G-CSF in vitro and in vivo.","['Yue, Lan-zhu', 'Fu, Rong', 'Wang, Hua-quan', 'Li, Li-juan', 'Hu, Hao-ran', 'Fu, Lin', 'Shao, Zong-hong']","['Yue LZ', 'Fu R', 'Wang HQ', 'Li LJ', 'Hu HR', 'Fu L', 'Shao ZH']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/08 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2010 Aug 5;123(15):2034-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Records for 896 childhood cancer survivors treated at the Sydney Children's Hospital between 1972 and 1999 were linked to the National Death Index and NSW Central Cancer Registry to identify deaths and notifications of second cancers. Survivors were defined as those alive for at least 5 years after diagnosis and were followed until death or 31 December 2004, whichever occurred first. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were used as measures of relative risk. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to quantify the influence of demographic and disease-related characteristics on the risk of death and second cancers. RESULTS: The SMR and SIR were 7.46 and 4.98 times higher, respectively, among cancer survivors relative to the NSW population. Relative mortality was highest in survivors of soft-tissue sarcoma (SMR, 18.95 [95% CI, 6.88-40.81]) and central nervous system (CNS) malignancies (SMR, 16.78 [95% CI, 7.62-31.64]). The leading causes of death included recurrence of the primary childhood cancer (55%) and second cancers (12%), as well as treatment-related complications (17%) The most frequently observed second cancers were bone and thyroid cancers, melanoma, and CNS malignancies, and second cancers were most common among survivors of leukaemia, soft-tissue sarcoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, survivors of childhood cancer in Australia are at increased risk of late mortality and second cancers. These findings highlight a continuing need to assess health issues faced by childhood cancer survivors and develop strategies to minimise the adverse outcomes associated with treatment for childhood cancer.","['Wilson, Carmen L', 'Cohn, Richard J', 'Johnston, Karen A', 'Ashton, Lesley J']","['Wilson CL', 'Cohn RJ', 'Johnston KA', 'Ashton LJ']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2010/09/08 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ash11307_fm [pii]', '10.5694/j.1326-5377.2010.tb03902.x [doi]']",ppublish,Med J Aust. 2010 Sep 6;193(5):258-61. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2010.tb03902.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received all-trans retinoic acid-based induction therapy. After two courses of consolidation chemotherapy, upfront auto-PBSCT was performed in 20 patients in the CR1. Five patients had a high WBC count of more than 10 x 10(9)/L (high risk), while 15 patients had a count of less than 10 x 10(9)/L (low risk) at initial presentation. In addition, six patients, who were considered as low-risk patients at presentation, had a relapse after three cycles of consolidation and 2 years of maintenance therapy, but gained the molecular remission after re-induction and consolidation, and underwent auto-PBSCT in the CR2.

Checkpoint loss results in genomic instability and contributes to the evolution of cancer. Among G1-, S-, G2- and M-phase checkpoints, genetic studies indicate the role of an intact S-phase checkpoint in maintaining genome integrity. Although the basic framework of the S-phase checkpoint in multicellular organisms has been outlined, the mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Human chromosome-11 band-q23 translocations disrupting the MLL gene lead to poor prognostic leukaemias. Here we assign MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian S-phase checkpoint network and identify checkpoint dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of MLL leukaemias. MLL is phosphorylated at serine 516 by ATR in response to genotoxic stress in the S phase, which disrupts its interaction with, and hence its degradation by, the SCF(Skp2) E3 ligase, leading to its accumulation. Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3 lysine 4 at late replication origins and inhibits the loading of CDC45 to delay DNA replication. Cells deficient in MLL showed radioresistant DNA synthesis and chromatid-type genomic abnormalities, indicative of S-phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of Mll(-/-) (Mll also known as Mll1) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type but not S516A or DeltaSET mutant MLL rescues the S-phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine myeloid progenitor cells carrying an Mll-CBP knock-in allele that mimics human t(11;16) leukaemia show a severe radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype. MLL fusions function as dominant negative mutants that abrogate the ATR-mediated phosphorylation/stabilization of wild-type MLL on damage to DNA, and thus compromise the S-phase checkpoint. Together, our results identify MLL as a key constituent of the mammalian DNA damage response pathway and show that deregulation of the S-phase checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations probably contributes to the pathogenesis of human MLL leukaemias.","['Liu, Han', 'Takeda, Shugaku', 'Kumar, Rakesh', 'Westergard, Todd D', 'Brown, Eric J', 'Pandita, Tej K', 'Cheng, Emily H-Y', 'Hsieh, James J-D']","['Liu H', 'Takeda S', 'Kumar R', 'Westergard TD', 'Brown EJ', 'Pandita TK', 'Cheng EH', 'Hsieh JJ']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100905,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (CDC45 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Atr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/physiology', 'Genes, Dominant/genetics', 'Genomic Instability/physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'S Phase/*physiology', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2010/09/08 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nature09350 [pii]', '10.1038/nature09350 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Sep 16;467(7313):343-6. doi: 10.1038/nature09350.

As major regulators of apoptosis, Bcl-2 proteins serve as emerging targets for novel chemotherapeutic strategies. In this study, we examined the involvement of Bcl-2 proteins in apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent actinomycin D. A dramatic decrease in anti-apoptotic myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) mRNA and protein expression was detected upon actinomycin D treatment. Further, Mcl-l over-expression caused resistance to cell death upon treatment with actinomycin D, implicating a role for the down-regulation of Mcl-1 in actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. We also explored the therapeutic potential of actinomycin D in combination with ABT-737, an experimental agent that inhibits anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Actinomycin D sensitized cells to ABT-737 treatment in a Bak- or Bax-dependent manner. Importantly, low concentrations of actinomycin D and ABT-737 were more effective in inducing cell death in transformed cells than their untransformed counterparts. A synergistic effect of actinomycin D and ABT-737 on cell death was observed in several human tumor cell lines. Like actinomycin D treatment, knocking down Mcl-1 expression greatly sensitized tumor cells to ABT-737, and Mcl-1 over-expression abrogated the cytotoxic effect induced by ABT-737 and actinomycin D. These results suggest that the down-regulation of Mcl-1 by actinomycin D is likely responsible for the observed synergistic effect between the two drugs. Overall, our studies provide compelling evidence that the combination of actinomycin D and ABT-737 may lead to an effective cancer treatment strategy.","['Olberding, Kristen E', 'Wang, Xiaoli', 'Zhu, Yanglong', 'Pan, Jianmin', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Li, Chi']","['Olberding KE', 'Wang X', 'Zhu Y', 'Pan J', 'Rai SN', 'Li C']","['Molecular Targets Group, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101101,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/09/08 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['13274 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.10.9.13274 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Nov 1;10(9):918-29. doi: 10.4161/cbt.10.9.13274.

Analysis of CD11b and apoptosis by flow-cytometry revealed that on 3rd day after irradiation by 8 Gy the HL-60-IR are more resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis and more differentiated (increase in CD11b in non-apoptotic cells) than regular HL-60. We found that both types of cells have high basal level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2 . Irradiation induces decrease in Erk1/2 phosphorylation after 4 and 8 h in both cell types. However, in HL-60-IR cells Erk1/2 phosphorylation is restored faster than in HL-60. Also it was found that in contrary to HL-60 cells, the HL-60-IR cells react to 2 Gy irradiation by p53 independent increase in p21(WAF1/Cip1), and not by activation of checkpoint kinase Chk-2. Therefore we concluded that relatively high dose of radiation (6 Gy) does not lead after 10 repetitive irradiations to eradication of HL-60 cells, but instead increases their radioresistance, increases the ability to differentiate, alters MAPK response, increases amount of p21(WAF1/Cip1), and decreases induction of apoptosis by ionizing radiation. p21(WAF1/Cip1) might prevent apoptosis induction and trigger permanent cell-cycle arrest, which can also contribute to regression of this leukaemia after therapy.","['Vavrova, Jirina', 'Tichy, Ales', 'Rezacova, Martina', 'Zarybnicka, Lenka', 'Sinkorova, Zuzana', 'Osterreicher, Jan']","['Vavrova J', 'Tichy A', 'Rezacova M', 'Zarybnicka L', 'Sinkorova Z', 'Osterreicher J']","['Department of Radiobiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hradec Kralove, University of Defence Brno, Czech Republic. vavrova@pmfhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays/therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*radiation effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Radiation Tolerance/*physiology']",2010/09/08 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2010 Sep;29(3):275-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, natural xanthines and/or sythesized xanthines may recall a lot positive affects (hemorheologic properties, anti-inflammatory properties, tracheal smooth muscle relaxant, positive chronotropic and central nervous system-stimulating, etc.) and may even induce a quantity of changes on the molecular level (inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, inhibition of the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, etc.). In our previous paper we showed that some xanthine derivatives (pentoxifylline and its derivatives) depress P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated multidrug resistance of the mouse leukemic cells. Other authors, first of all Sadzuka and co-workers, confirm this usefulness of long side substituted xanthines as biochemical modulators. However, the mechanism of molecular action of xanthine derivatives has not been clarified. One of the possible ways to chemosensitize the cancer cells is direct competiting in defence mechanism - inhibition of efflux pump (P-gp). Interaction of xanthine derivatives with binding site of P-gp is a question which could be solved by experiment; although, molecular modelling may clear up this matter. But, each dynamic and static program for molecular simulation of P-gp action is dividing on input variable, considering mechanistic view of insight drug transport.","['Docolomansky, Peter', 'Bohacova, Viera', 'Barancik, Miroslav', 'Breier, Albert']","['Docolomansky P', 'Bohacova V', 'Barancik M', 'Breier A']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 5, 833 34 Bratislava. viera.bohacova@savba.sk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Xanthines)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xanthines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2010/09/08 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/gpb_2010_03_215 [doi]'],ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2010 Sep;29(3):215-21. doi: 10.4149/gpb_2010_03_215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
