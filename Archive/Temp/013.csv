However, its role in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. Therefore, we compared the gene transcription data of healthy and pancreatic cancer tissues using the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. R software (v3.6.1) was used for the differential, clinicopathological correlation, and survival analyses. We found that NCEH1 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with that in healthy tissues (P = 1.732 e-50), and that its expression level was related to lymph node metastasis. High NCEH1 expression was associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.002). Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we determined that NCEH1 is an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis identified that NCEH1 overexpression is prominent in cell-cell adhesion junctions, pancreatic cancer, cancer-associated pathways, prostate cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia. In contrast, low NCEH1 expression correlated to high oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude that NCEH1 may be a prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer.",['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2020.'],"['Lu, Yan', 'Zhang, Longyi', 'Chen, Xuya', 'Zhang, Qiaohong']","['Lu Y', 'Zhang L', 'Chen X', 'Zhang Q']","[""Clinical Laboratory, Dongyang People's Hospital 60 West Wuning Road, Dongyang 322100, Zhejiang, China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, Dongyang People's Hospital 60 West Wuning Road, Dongyang 322100, Zhejiang, China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, Dongyang People's Hospital 60 West Wuning Road, Dongyang 322100, Zhejiang, China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, Dongyang People's Hospital 60 West Wuning Road, Dongyang 322100, Zhejiang, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201101,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,PMC7716126,['NOTNLM'],"['NCEH1', 'TCGA', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'leading edge analysis', 'pancreatic cancer', 'prognostic biomarker']",['None.'],2020/12/08 06:00,2020/12/08 06:01,['2020/12/07 17:11'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/07 17:11 [entrez]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/08 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2020 Nov 1;13(11):2746-2752. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard induction therapy leads to complete remission in approximately 50% to 75% of patients. In spite of favorable primary response rates, only 20% to 30% of patients enjoy long-term disease free survival. Identifying proteins involved in prognosis is important for proposing biomarkers that can aid in the clinical management of the disease. The aim of this study was to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network based on serum proteins associated with unfavorable prognosis of AML, and analyze the biological pathways underlying molecular complexes in the network. We identified 16 candidate serum proteins associated with unfavorable prognosis (in terms of poor response to treatment, poor overall survival, short complete remission, and relapse) in AML via a search in the literature: IL2RA, FTL, HSP90AA1, D2HGDH, PLAU, COL18A1, FGF19, SPP1, FGA, PF4, NME1, TNF, ANGPT2, B2M, CD274, LGALS3. The PPI network was constructed with Cytoscape using association networks from String and BioGRID, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the ClueGo pluggin was performed. The central protein in the network was found to be PTPN11 which is involved in modulating the RAS-ERK, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways, as well as in hematopoiesis, and in the regulation of apoptotic genes. Therefore, a dysregulation of this protein and/or of the proteins connected to it in the network leads to the defective activation of these signaling pathways and to a reduction in apoptosis. Together, this could cause an increase in the frequency of leukemic cells and a resistance to apoptosis in response to treatment.",,"['Rendon-Rodriguez, Juan Jose', 'Restrepo-Rodriguez, Luisa Fernanda', 'Rothlisberger, Sarah']","['Rendon-Rodriguez JJ', 'Restrepo-Rodriguez LF', 'Rothlisberger S']","['Biomedical Innovation and Research Group, Faculty of Applied and Exact Sciences, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano ITM, 050034 Medellin, Colombia.', 'Biomedical Innovation and Research Group, Faculty of Applied and Exact Sciences, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano ITM, 050034 Medellin, Colombia.', 'Biomedical Innovation and Research Group, Faculty of Applied and Exact Sciences, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano ITM, 050034 Medellin, Colombia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,,,,,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/12/07 14:19'],"['2019/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 14:19 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2020 Dec 7;67(4):475-483. doi: 10.18388/abp.2020_5094.,20210802,10.18388/abp.2020_5094 [doi],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/blood/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Ontology', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/blood/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/blood/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/blood/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'STAT Transcription Factors/blood/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/blood/genetics']","['5094 [pii]', '10.18388/abp.2020_5094 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It manifests as an impairment of the ocular surface, such as severe dry eye disease, and deteriorates the recipient's visual function and quality of life. We encountered an ""overlap syndrome"" of ocular GVHD, which is characterized by the presence of both acute and chronic GVHD symptoms. In this report, we present the treatment progress of the overlap syndrome in a case with ocular GVHD. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man with acute myeloblastic leukemia underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Six weeks after the treatment, the recipient complained of eye pain and discharge. He was diagnosed with the overlap syndrome due to low tear volume, severe corneal epithelitis, hyperemia, and a pseudomembrane on the conjunctiva. Immune cells infiltration, fibrinoid degeneration, fibroblastic and spindle-shaped cells, and fibrosis were observed in the pathology of the pseudomembrane. The recipient was treated with topical immunosuppression and pseudomembrane removal. One week after the initial treatment, ocular GVHD improved. Twelve weeks after the treatment, the topical steroid was discontinued due to the elevation of intraocular pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of conjunctival pseudomembrane in ocular GVHD is important to determine the stage of the case and to assess systemic GVHD. Furthermore, prompt removal of the pseudomembrane after diagnosis is an appropriate management to reduce the symptoms of ocular GVHD. The combination of topical steroids and immunosuppressive agents is suggested to be an effective treatment in management of overlap syndrome.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

An ontology is needed for semantic analysis of social media data. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to develop a cancer ontology with terminology containing consumer terms and to analyze social media data to identify health information needs and emotions related to cancer. METHODS: A cancer ontology was developed using social media data, collected with a crawler, from online communities and blogs between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017 in South Korea. The relative frequencies of posts containing ontology concepts were counted and compared by cancer type. RESULTS: The ontology had 9 superclasses, 213 class concepts, and 4061 synonyms. Ontology-driven natural language processing was performed on the text from 754,744 cancer-related posts. Colon, breast, stomach, cervical, lung, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancer; brain tumors; and leukemia appeared most in these posts. At the superclass level, risk factor was the most frequent, followed by emotions, symptoms, treatments, and dealing with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Information needs and emotions differed according to cancer type. The observations of this study could be used to provide tailored information to consumers according to cancer type and care process. Attention should be paid to provision of cancer-related information to not only patients but also their families and the general public seeking information on cancer.","['(c)Jooyun Lee, Hyeoun-Ae Park, Seul Ki Park, Tae-Min Song.

We generated isogenic MCF10A cell lines with deletion mutations of genes encoding cohesin subunits SMC3, RAD21, and STAG2 and screened for synthetic lethality with 3009 FDA-approved compounds. The screen identified several compounds that interfere with transcription, DNA damage repair and the cell cycle. Unexpectedly, one of the top 'hits' was a GSK3 inhibitor, an agonist of Wnt signaling. We show that sensitivity to GSK3 inhibition is likely due to stabilization of beta-catenin in cohesin-mutant cells, and that Wnt-responsive gene expression is highly sensitized in STAG2-mutant CMK leukemia cells. Moreover, Wnt activity is enhanced in zebrafish mutant for cohesin subunits stag2b and rad21.

METHODS: The clinical characteristics of 135 patients diagnosed as de novo MDS in People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from September 2015 to September 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Next-generation sequencing was used to detect 34 kinds of myeloid-tumor-related gene in MDS patients. The clinical characteristics of BCOR/BCORL1 mutation and its effect to progression-free survival(PSF) and overall survival (OS) in MDS patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Among MDS patients, BCOR/BCORL1 mutation was found in 34(25.2%) patients, including 16(11.9%) BCOR mutation and 18(13.3%) BCORL1 mutation. Patients with BCOR/BCORL1 mutation were more common in women and showed lower neutrophil count 0.75(0.08-22.20) vs 1.27(0.06-35.71)x10(9)/L, P=0.047 as compared with those without BCOR/BCORL1 mutation. There were no significant difference in the rate of BCOR/BCORL1 mutation in different IPSS-R subgroups, the IPSS-R lower risk group and the IPSS-R higher risk group, different genetic groups, and conversion or non-conversion to leukemia group(P=0.725, P=0.713, P=0.273, P=0.165).

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 7 medical centers, 45 patients with MDS (>/= 60 years old) and MDS-transformed AML from October 2016 to January 2019 were enrolled, with the median age of 68.5 years old. The risk stratification of patients was poor or very poor, according to IPSS-R score. The treament results of decitabine combined with CEG and decitabine combined with CAG were compared. RESULTS: The comparison of the two regiem showed that the DCEG regimen had advantages on total effective rate (ORR, 86.4% vs 47.8%, respectively), overall survival time (OS) (10.0 months vs 6.0 months, respectively) and progression-free survival time (PFS) (9.0 months vs 3.0 months, respectively). About 50% of MDS patients treated by DCEG regimen achieved PR or CR, with a median OS of 31 months. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with PR or CR after induction therapy and DCEG regimen had longer survival time (31months).

According to whether the patients had U2AF1 gene mutation, the patients were divided into U2AF1 mutated group and non-mutated group, and the relationship between gene mutation characteristics and clinical manifestations and prognosis was analyzed. Then according to the difference of the mutation site of U2AF1, the patients in U2AF1 mutated group were divided into U2AF1(S34) mutated group and U2AF1(Q157/R156) mutated group, and the correlation between gene mutation characteristics and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of U2AF1 mutation in MDS patients was approximately 11.3% (23/203), and the mutation frequency of U2AF1 allele was 32.5%. The male ratio in U2AF1 mutated group was significantly higher than that in U2AF1 non-mutated group (P=0.001).

FITC Annexin V/PI double staining method was used to analyze the change of apoptosis rate. Immunocytochemistry method was used to detect the expression of wild-type P53 protein. RESULTS: Different concentration of AICAR was inhibitory effect on K562 cells at different time point of action for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and the inhibition was time and dose-dependent (r=0.71, r=0.84). The combination of AICAR and IFN-alpha-2b could effectively inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis of K562 cells.

METHODS: 365 patients with newly diagnosed AML (except M3) treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were enrolled and retrospective analysis, and multi-parameter flow cytometry was performed to detect the expression of CD123 in myeloid leukemia cell population. CD123>/=20% was defined as positive. Clinical features, concomitant fusion gene or gene mutation, efficacy and prognosis of CD123(+) and CD123(-) patients were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rate of CD123 in 365 newly diagnosed AML patients was 38.9%. Compared with the CD123(-) group, the white blood cell count (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and bone marrow blast cell ratio were higher in the CD123(+) group, and the ratio of NPM1 and DMNT3a gene mutations and the CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion gene was significantly increased, while the ratio of CEBPA gene mutation and AML-ETO fusion gene was significantly reduced. The rate of first inducing complete remission and total remission in CD123(+) group was significantly lower than that in CD123(-) group. There was no significant difference in recurrence rate between the two groups (P>0.05). Survival analysis showed that in 77 AML patients with normal karyotype and intermediate risk, the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate of the CD123(+) group were significantly lower than those of the CD123(-) group. Multivariate analysis showed that CD123 was an independent prognostic risk factor for OS and EFS in AML patients with normal karyotype and intermediate risk.

METHODS: The acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 and the normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were selected as subjects. The expression of let-7b-5p and FTO mRNA in those cells was detected by qPCR, further the expression of FTO protein in those cells was detected by Western blot. And, the luciferase reporter gene assay was used to verify the targeting effect of let-7b-5p on FTO. Finally, THP-1 cells were transfected respectively with let-7b-5p mimic, and PBMNC with let-7b-5p inhibitor, there after the C-MYC mRNA m(6)A enrichment level in transfected cells was analyzed by dot blot, the expression levels of let-7b-5p, FTO and c-MYC were assayed by RT-PCR, the expressions of FTO and c-MYC protein were verified by Western blot, and the proliferation level of cells after transfection was detected by MTT assay. RESULTS: Compared with PBMNC, the expression of let-7b-5p in THP-1 significantly decreased, while the expression of FTO was significantly increased (P<0.05). After transfection with let-7b-5p mimic combined with FTO 3'-UTR, the luciferase activity of transfected THP-1 cells significantly decreased, but the luciferase activity significantly increased after transfection with mutant 3'-UTR, which was significantly different from the negative control group(blank vector) (P<0.05).

METHODS: Different concentrations of GO6976 were applied to the K562 cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and normal BaF3 cells, MTT assay was used to detect the effect on cell proliferation. BALB/C mice were used to investigate the toxicity in vivo. The general situation, body weight and the number of white blood cells in peripheral blood were monitored during administration, the blood collected from eyeballs before and after administration was used for biochemical examination, at the same time, the liver, kidney and femurs were examined pathologically. RESULTS: GO6976 could significantly inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells, inhibition effect increased with increasing dose (r=0.9623). However, there was no significant change in the inhibitory effect on PBMNC and BaF3 cells. The pathological examination of organs in each group showed no abnormal manifestations such as inflammatory infiltration, while the change rate of leukocyte count in peripheral blood of high dose group fluctuated greatly (P0.05), which might be related to the inhibition of intracellular protein kinase C, and no abnormality was observed in blood biochemical indexes.

METHODS: 55 cases of paediatric TCF3-PBX1(+) ALL patients from April 2008 to April 2015 were enrolled and analyzed. The FCM and PCR was used to detect the MRD in 239 bone marrow samples of 55 patients. All statistical analyses were carried out by using SPSS software version 16. RESULTS: Among the 55 children with TCF3-PBX1(+) ALL, there were 30 male and 25 female. The median age was 5 (1-14) years. 20 patients relapsed during follow-up. The MRD results from PCR and FCM showed a strong correlation between both methods (K=0.774, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in 5-years DFS and OS between the patients in PCR(+) and PCR(-) groups on day 15 or day 33. The 5 year DFS rate between the patients in FCM(-) and FCM(+) was 63.9%+/-7.0% and 0; the 5 year OS rate was 66.5%+/-7.9% and 0.

METHODS: After HL-60 cells in logarithmic growth phase were treated with Olaparib at different concentrations for different times (24, 48 h), the expression of NKG2D ligand on the surface of HL-60 cells was detected by flow cytometry. Western blot was used to dectect the expression of ERK expression in HL-60 cells. The killing effect of NK cells to HL-60 cells was detected by CFSE/PI method. RESULTS: 10 mumol/L Olaparib could upregulate the expression of NKG2D ligand on the surface of HL-60 cell at 24 and 48 hours, while 5 mumol/L Olaparib could induce up-regulation of the expression of ULBP-2 and ULBP-3 at 48 hours. Western blot analysis showed that ERK phosphorylation of HL-60 cells was enhanced after treating with Olaparib. The killing effect of NK cells to HL-60 cells could be enhanced by Olaparib, however, ERK inhibitor could suppress the killing effect of NK cells to HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Olaparib can upregulate NKG2D ligands expression on the surface of HL-60 cells and enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cell to HL-60 cells.

METHODS: The genetic mutation results and clinical data of 19 children with JMML in Fujian from January 2015 to December 2018 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. According to the results of gene mutation, they were divided into PTPN11 gene mutation group and non-PTPN11 gene mutation group, and the clinical characteristics and prognosis of children with JMML between two groups were compared. RESULTS: Among the 19 children with JMML, 14 cases were male and 5 cases were female, and male/female ratio was 2.8ratio1. The median age at diagnosis was 13(3-48) months, and 14 cases (73.68%) were less than 2 years old. Abdominal distension and pyrexia were the common initial symptoms, and all the children with JMML had splenomegaly. The median white blood cell count was 39.82(4.53-103.4)x10(9)/Land monocyte count was 4.37(1.04-23.12)x10(9)/L. HbF was higher than the normal high value of the same age in 8 cases (42.11%). All JMML children's Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene were negative. Among the 19 patients, there were 1 case without any JMML related gene mutation, 7 cases (36.84%) with PTPN11 mutation, 6 cases (31.58%) with K-Ras mutation, 2 cases with NF1 mutation (10.53%), 2 cases with N-Ras mutation (10.53%), and 1 case (5.26%) with NF1 and N-Ras mutations simultaneously. Fifteen patients who only received supporting therapy all died, with a median survival time 9.2 (0.4-58.1) months. Whereas, among the four JMML children who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT), three cases survived and only one case died. Compared with the non-PTPN11 gene mutation group, the proportion of patients with hemoglobin F higher than the normal value of the same age was higher, and the median survival time was shorter in PTPN11 gene mutation group, and the differences were statistically significant (P=0.048 and 0.046, respectively). CONCLUSION: JMML is more common in male infancy and toddlerhood, and the main gene mutation types are PTPN11 and Ras mutations. Because the JMML children with PTPN11 mutations show particularly rapid disease progression, if there is no timely intervention, most children die in a short period of time. Therefore, early HSCT may improve the prognosis of the children with JMML.",,"['Weng, Kai-Zhi', 'Zheng, Yong-Zhi', 'Zhuang, Shu-Quan', 'Chen, Hai-Yun', 'LE, Shao-Hua']","['Weng KZ', 'Zheng YZ', 'Zhuang SQ', 'Chen HY', 'LE SH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Blood Medical Center, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Longyan First Hospital, Longyan 364000, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Blood Medical Center, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China,E-mail: lele883@sina.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,,,2020/12/08 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/07 08:43'],"['2020/12/07 08:43 [entrez]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Dec;28(6):1811-1818. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.06.004.,20201208,10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.06.004 [doi],"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']","['1009-2137(2020)06-1811-08 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.06.004 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 30 patients diagnosed as PCL in our hospital from January 1993 to December 2019 were enrolled, and the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, therapeutic regimes, and survival data of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the 30 patients was 56.5 (28-80) years old, among them, 25 patients were primary plasma cell leukemia, and 5 patients were secondary plasma cell leukemia. Complex karyotypes and subdiploids were most common in cytogenetic abnormalities. Among the 20 cases of chromosome G banding, 11 (55%) cases were complex karyotypes and 8 (40%) cases were hypodiploid. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) test showed that among 11 cases, 6 cases showed 17p13 deletion, 8 cases showed at least two kinds of abnormalities, which including t (14; 16), t (8; 14), t (11;14), 17p13 deletion, and 13q14 deletion. The median overall survival (OS) time was 10.5 months for all patients. The median OS time of the patients in ECOG score </= 2 group was 21.5 months, which was significantly longer than those in the ECOG score>2 group(1.2 months) (P=0.017). The median OS time of the patients treated with novel agents (including proteasome inhibitor and/or immunomodulator) was 24.9 months, which was significantly longer than the patients treated with traditional chemotherapy group(10.5 months) (P0.001). For the patients treated with novel agents, the median OS time of patients accepted two novel agents combination was 30.9 months, which was longer than those of single novel agent(11.5 months) (P=0.021). The effect of genetic abnormolity to the OS of the patients showed no statistical difference. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that ECOG score>2 was the independent prognostic factor of plasma cell leukemia patients. There were two patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the study,but died due to the pulmonary infection within 6 months after transplantation. CONCLUSION: In the era of novel agents, ECOG score is an independent prognostic factor of plasma cell leukemia. Multiple novel agents treatment should be underwent as soon as possible to improve the prognosis of the patients.

METHODS: Drug-resistance leukemia cell line was established by transfecting pcDNA3.1-STAT3 into K562 cells (K562/STAT3). The expression of STAT3, BAX and NKG2D ligands (MICA and ULBP1) in K562/-cells, K562/STAT3 were detected by Western blot and/or RQ-PCR. Cells apoptosis and the killing effect of NK cells on leukemia cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of the total STAT3, STAT3 phosphorylation in K562/STAT3 was significantly increased, and P-gp mRNA expression was increased also significantly (P<0.005). In K562/STAT3 cells, the expression of pro-apoptotic BAX (P=0.005) was significantly lower, and the number of apoptotic cells (P=0.002) induced by adriamycin was significantly decreased as compared with those in K562/- cells. After K562/STAT3 cells were treated by STAT3 inhibitor (SH-4-54), the expression of BAX mRNA (P=0.017) was significantly higher and the number of apoptotic cells (P=0.005) was significantly increased. The MICA and ULBP1 mRNA expression in K562/STAT3 cells was significantly lower than that in K562/- cells, and also for MICA and ULBP1 protein (MICA and ULPB1 mRNA: P<0.0001, MICA protein: P=0.001, ULPB1 protein: P=0.022). After K562/STAT3 cells were treated with STAT3 inhibitor (SH-4-54), the expression of MICA mRNA and protein was increased (mRNA: P=0.001, protein: P=0.002), but ULBP1 mRNA and protein showed no significantly change (mRNA: P=0.137, protein: P=0.1905). The cytotoxicity of NK cells to K562/STAT3 cells was susceptible as compared with K562/- (P=0.002), but the cytotoxicity of K562/STAT3 cells to NK cell could be recovered by STAT3 inhibitor (P=0.006).

We report here the case of a 37-year-old man who developed a GS of the retro-orbital as an isolated manifestation of AML relapse 27 months after allo-HSCT. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old man was diagnosed with AML and subsequently received allo-HSCT after clinical chemical remission. The patient suddenly presented with painless exophthalmos of the left eye twenty-seven months after allo-HSCT. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left retro-orbital masses. Histopathology revealed diffused infiltration of leukemic blasts. Further systemic investigation showed no leukemic involvement of his other organs. Isolated retro-orbital relapse of AML was diagnosed. Despite treatment using retro-orbital irradiation, the patient died 6 months after presentation.

Here we report on a patient with a rare FLT3 germline variant in the context of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A female patient aged 57 years presented with AML with mutations in the IDH2, ASXL1, and DNMT3A genes. She underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant but relapsed 2 years posttransplant. Targeted next generation sequencing identified a new missense variant in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain c.2440G > T (p.A814S). The treating team considered the possibility of patient eligibility for an FLT3 inhibitor. Because both somatic and germline mutations can be identified in tumor tissue with high-throughput sequencing, it becomes important to distinguish the origin of these alterations when possible-especially, in this challenging case, to define the treatment modality. Simultaneous tumor/germline sequencing allows for the identification of rare germline mutations and may help in determining their significance in the pathogenesis of disease.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2020.

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the routinely used method, but has limitations in quantification accuracy due to its inherent technical variation. Treatment recommendations rely on specific BCR-ABL1 values set at timed response milestones, making precise measurement of BCR-ABL1 a requisite. Furthermore, the sensitivity of qPCR may be insufficient to reliably quantify low levels of residual BCR-ABL1 in patients in deep molecular response (DMR) who could qualify for an attempt to discontinue Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy. We reviewed the current use of digital PCR (dPCR) as a promising alternative for response monitoring in CML. dPCR offers an absolute BCR-ABL1 quantification at various disease levels with remarkable precision and a clinical sensitivity reaching down to at least MR5.0. Moreover, dPCR has been validated in multiple studies as prognostic marker for successful TKI treatment discontinuation, while this could not be achieved using classical qPCR. dPCR may thus prospectively be the preferred method to reliably identify patients achieving treatment milestones after initiation of TKI therapy as well as for the selection and timing for TKI discontinuation.","['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

However, the molecular mechanisms and key regulators involved in the global regulation of gene expression levels in AMoL are poorly understood. In order to elucidate the role of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) and transcription factors (TFs) in AMoL pathogenesis at the network level, miRNA and TF expression level profiles were systematically analyzed by miRNA sequencing and TF array, respectively; this identified 285 differentially expressed miRNAs and 139 differentially expressed TFs in AMoL samples compared with controls. By combining expression level profile data and bioinformatics tools available for predicting TF and miRNA targets, a comprehensive AMoL-specific miRNA-TF-mediated regulatory network was constructed. A total of 26 miRNAs and 23 TFs were identified as hub nodes in the network. Among these hubs, miR-29b-3p, MYC, TP53 and NFKB1 were determined to be potential AMoL regulators, and were subsequently extracted to construct sub-networks. A hypothetical pathway model was also proposed for miR-29b-3p to reveal the potential co-regulatory mechanisms of miR-29b-3p, MYC, TP53 and NFKB1 in AMoL.

In a promising alternative, antigens are targeted to DC-associated endocytic receptors in vivo with antibody-antigen conjugates co-administered with toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists as adjuvants. To combine the potential advantages of in vivo targeting of DCs with those of conjugated TLR agonists, we generated a multifunctional antibody construct integrating the DC-specific delivery of viral- or tumor-associated antigens and DC activation by TLR ligation in one molecule. We validated its functionality in vitro and determined if TLR ligation might improve the efficacy of such a molecule. In proof-of-principle studies, an alphaCD40 antibody containing a CMV pp65-derived peptide as an antigen domain (alphaCD40(CMV)) was genetically fused to the TLR5-binding D0/D1 domain of bacterial flagellin (alphaCD40.Flg(CMV)). The analysis of surface maturation markers on immature DCs revealed that fusion of flagellin to alphaCD40(CMV) highly increased DC maturation (3.4-fold elevation of CD80 expression compared to alphaCD40(CMV) alone) by specifically interacting with TLR5. Immature DCs loaded with alphaCD40.Flg(CMV) induced significantly higher CMVNLV-specific T cell activation and proliferation compared to alphaCD40(CMV) in co-culture experiments with allogeneic and autologous T cells (1.8-fold increase in % IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha(+) CD8(+) T cells and 3.9-fold increase in % CMVNLV-specific dextramer(+) CD8(+) T cells). More importantly, we confirmed the beneficial effects of flagellin-dependent DC stimulation using a tumor-specific neoantigen as the antigen domain. Specifically, the acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-specific mutated NPM1 (mNPM1)-derived neoantigen CLAVEEVSL was delivered to DCs in the form of alphaCD40(mNPM1) and alphaCD40.Flg(mNPM1) antibody constructs, making this study the first to investigate mNPM1 in a DC vaccination context.

Optimization of the CAR design to improve persistence and cytotoxicity is a focus of the current CAR-T study. Herein, we established a novel CAR structure by adding a full length 4-1BB co-stimulatory receptor to a 28Z-based second generation CAR that targets CD20. Our data indicated that this new 2028Z-4-1BB CAR-T cell showed improved proliferation and cytotoxic ability. To further understand the mechanism of action, we found that constitutive 4-1BB sensing significantly reduced the apoptosis of CAR-T cells, enhanced proliferation, and increased NF-kappaB pathway activation. Consistent with the enhanced proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro, this new structure of CAR-T cells exhibited robust persistence and anti-tumor activity in a mouse xenograft lymphoma model. This work provides evidence for a new strategy to optimize the function of CAR-T against lymphoma.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Dai, Han, Qi, Li, Li, Fan, Zhang, Zhang and Yang.']","['Dai, Qiang', 'Han, Ping', 'Qi, Xinyue', 'Li, Fanlin', 'Li, Min', 'Fan, Lilv', 'Zhang, Huihui', 'Zhang, Xiaoqing', 'Yang, Xuanming']","['Dai Q', 'Han P', 'Qi X', 'Li F', 'Li M', 'Fan L', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang X', 'Yang X']","['Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Sheng Yushou Center of Cell Biology and Immunology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201113,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7691374,['NOTNLM'],"['* CD20', '*4-1BB', '*chimeric antigen receptor-modified T', '*immunotherapy', '*lymphoma']",,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/12/07 05:31'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/07 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 13;11:539654. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.539654. eCollection 2020.,20210428,10.3389/fimmu.2020.539654 [doi],"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/genetics/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.539654 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A budget impact model (BIM) was developed to evaluate the 3-year total budgetary impact of treating adults with R/R FLT3 (mut+) AML eligible for gilteritinib in a hypothetical US health plan. Total costs (drugs/administration, hospitalization, monitoring, adverse events, transfusions, subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, post-progression, and FLT3 testing) were estimated before and after gilteritinib entry. The budget impact was the total cost difference between the two scenarios. The target population size and cost inputs were based on public data or published literature, drug market share was informed by market research data, and the model included recommended treatments for R/R FLT3 (mut+) AML per clinical guidelines. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSAs) and scenario analyses varying key model inputs and assumptions were conducted to test for robustness. RESULTS: In a hypothetical health plan with 1 million members, 20.9 adults with R/R FLT3 (mut+) AML were estimated to be eligible for gilteritinib. Of these, it was assumed 30.0% would be treated with gilteritinib in Year 1 following gilteritinib entry, increasing the total plan budget by $663,795 and the per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost by $0.055. In Years 2-3, the market share of gilteritinib increased to 45.0%, increasing the total plan budget impact by $1,078,371 and $1,087,230, and the PMPM cost by $0.090 and $0.091, respectively. The model results remained robust in DSAs and scenario analyses, with the largest impact observed when the projected uptake of gilteritinib was changed. LIMITATIONS: The results of this BIM are contingent upon the model's assumptions and inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Adding gilteritinib to the formulary for the treatment of adults with R/R FLT3 (mut+) AML had a minimal budget impact from a US payer's perspective.",,"['Pandya, Bhavik J', 'Yang, Hongbo', 'Schmeichel, Cynthia', 'Qi, Cynthia Z', 'Shah, Manasee V']","['Pandya BJ', 'Yang H', 'Schmeichel C', 'Qi CZ', 'Shah MV']","['Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc, Northbrook, IL, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc, Northbrook, IL, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc, Northbrook, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'I00', 'I10', 'budget impact analysis', 'costs', 'gilteritinib', 'relapsed/refractory FLT3 mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia']",,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2020/12/07 05:22'],"['2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 05:22 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Econ. 2021 Jan-Dec;24(1):19-28. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2020.1851698.,20210929,10.1080/13696998.2020.1851698 [doi],"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds', 'Budgets', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', '*Pyrazines', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['10.1080/13696998.2020.1851698 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic options for patients with CMML are limited, and although hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine and decitabine are the standard of care, only 40% of patients achieve a response, and most responses are transient. Over the last 5 years, significant advances have been made in the understanding of the clonal landscape of CMML, some of the mechanisms associated to resistance to HMA, and other key biological processes involved in disease pathogenesis. Areas covered: The current article reviews the most relevant emerging therapies currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of previously untreated or relapsed CMML. Expert opinion: The presence of recurrent somatic mutations in CMML represents therapeutic opportunities to utilize specific small molecule inhibitors such as IDH, FLT3, MEK/ERK, PLK1, or splicing inhibitors and modulators. In addition, other novel agents such as immune therapies, BCL2 or MCL1 inhibitors and other monoclonal antibodies could lead to therapeutic advances. Identifying specific patient populations likely to benefit from some of these interventions, and development of optimal combinations will remain the challenge when determining their role in therapy.",,"['Ramos Perez, Jorge', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo']","['Ramos Perez J', 'Montalban-Bravo G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201213,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CMML', '*chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*clinical trials', '*novel therapies', '*therapies']",,2020/12/08 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/12/07 05:22'],"['2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/07 05:22 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2020 Dec;25(4):515-529. doi: 10.1080/14728214.2020.1854224.

Methods: THP-1 cells were cultured in vitro and 5 mug/L phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was applied to induce THP-1 cells differentiating into macrophages for 48 h in low glucose culture medium (5.5 mmol/L). THP-1-derived macrophages were then cultured with low glucose, medium glucose (15 mmol/L) or high glucose (25 mmol/L) media respectively. The proliferation of THP-1-derived macrophages was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method and the expressions of miR-126 and proliferation-associated factors were detected by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The miR-126 mimic or inhibitor was transfected into THP-1-derived macrophages for 72 h. The proliferation of cells was detected by CCK-8 method and the expressions of miR-126 or proliferation-associated factors were detected by qRT-PCR. Results: Increasing glucose concentration decreased the proliferation of THP-1-derived macrophages (day 7, A values in low, medium and high glucose groups were 0.369+/-0.014, 0.214+/-0.009 and 0.200+/-0.010, respectively, P<0.01) as well as the survival rate (P<0.05), promoted the expression of miR-126, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (BAX) and caspase-3 (P<0.05), and suppressed Bcl-2, phosphoinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit 2 (PIK3R2) expression (P<0.05). After the miR-126 mimic was transfected in cells in low glucose medium for 72 h, compared with negative control (1.005+/-0.118), the expression of miR-126 significantly increased (2 980.227+/-170.431, P<0.05), and the proliferation of THP-1 derived macrophages decreased (negative control: 1.816+/-0.013, mimic group: 1.310+/-0.048, P<0.01), the level of BAX and caspase-3 significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05), PIK3R2 and Bcl-2 significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01). After the miR-126 inhibitor was transfected in cells cultured in high glucose medium for 72 h, compared with negative control (0.723+/-0.133), the proliferation of inhibitor group increased (0.984+/-0.049, P<0.05), the level of BAX and caspase-3 significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), PIK3R2 and Bcl-2 significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05). Conclusions: High glucose condition can inhibit the proliferation of THP-1-derived macrophages and increase the expression of miR-126. MiR-126 can inhibit the proliferation of THP-1-derived macrophages in high glucose environment through up-regulating the expression of BAX and caspase-3 and down-regulating the expression of PIK3R2 and Bcl-2.",,"['Mu, Y Z', 'Deng, J Y', 'Li, J J', 'Song, L T', 'Jiang, S Y']","['Mu YZ', 'Deng JY', 'Li JJ', 'Song LT', 'Jiang SY']","['Department of Periodontics, Institute of Stomatology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.', 'Department of Periodontics, Institute of Stomatology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.', 'Department of Periodontics, Institute of Stomatology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.', 'Department of Periodontics, Institute of Stomatology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.', 'Stomatological Center, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,8711066,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diabetes mellitus', 'Macrophages', 'MicroRNA-126', 'Periodontitis', 'Proliferation']",,2020/12/08 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/12/07 01:55'],"['2020/12/07 01:55 [entrez]', '2020/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Dec 9;55(12):969-975. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20200409-00199.,20201208,10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20200409-00199 [doi],"['0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Glucose', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20200409-00199 [doi]'],,,,['17JCYBJC26300/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin of China'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We searched for a biomarker that can more easily distinguish Ph-MPNs from reactive hypercytosis and myelofibrosis by using RNA-seq analysis utilizing platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-derived RNAs from patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and reactive thrombocytosis, and CREB3L1 was found to have an extremely high impact in discriminating the two disorders. To validate and further explore the result, expression levels of CREB3L1 in PRP were quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR and compared among patients with ET, other Ph-MPNs, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and reactive hypercytosis and myelofibrosis. A CREB3L1 expression cutoff value determined based on PRP of 18 healthy volunteers accurately discriminated 150 driver mutation-positive Ph-MPNs from other entities (71 reactive hypercytosis and myelofibrosis, 6 CML, and 18 healthy volunteers) and showed both sensitivity and specificity of 1.0000. Importantly, CREB3L1 expression levels were significantly higher in ET compared with reactive thrombocytosis (P < .0001), and polycythemia vera compared with reactive erythrocytosis (P < .0001). Pathology-affirmed triple-negative ET (TN-ET) patients were divided into a high- and low-CREB3L1-expression group, and some patients in the low-expression group achieved a spontaneous remission during the clinical course. In conclusion, CREB3L1 analysis has the potential to single-handedly discriminate driver mutation-positive Ph-MPNs from reactive hypercytosis and myelofibrosis, and also may identify a subgroup within TN-ET showing distinct clinical features including spontaneous remission.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

A prognostic score identifying patients within this large group who are at high risk of disease progression would be highly beneficial. The recently published International Prognostic Score for Early asymptomatic patients (IPS-E) uses combination of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >15 x 10(9) /l, palpable lymphadenopathy, and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGHV) gene to predict the time to first-line therapy (TTFT). Patients at low, intermediate, and high risk had estimated 5-year TTFT of 8%, 28%, and 61%. We performed an external validation of the IPS-E score using an unselected, consecutive group of 130 Binet A patients. The 5-year TTFT was 11%, 36%, and 78% (C-statistic 0.74). Furthermore, we propose an alternative system (AIPS-E) using cytogenetic aberrations instead of palpable lymphadenopathy. This system yielded 5-year TTFT of 14%, 40%, and 72%. These results were externally validated in 388 Binet A patients from five Czech centres; the 5-year TTFT was 16%, 37%, and 80% (C-statistic 0.74).

Clinical manifestations of T-LGLL in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are often identical to those in which one would suspect Felty's syndrome (FS). These disorders are distinguished by the presence of T-cell clonality, which is present in T-LGLL but not in FS. Mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and 5b (STAT5b) genes can be used as molecular markers of T-LGLL, but their prevalence in FS is unknown.Eighty-one patients with RA and unexplained neutropenia or/and an increase in the number of LGLs above 2 x 10(9)/L were stratified into RA-associated T-LGLL (N = 56) or FS (N = 25) groups based on the presence or absence of T-cell clonality.

Measurable residual disease (MRD) following induction chemotherapy could be incorporated as a useful parameter for treatment decisions. The present study evaluated treatment outcomes according to the next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based MRD status and the type of consolidation therapy in patients with normal karyotype (NK)-AML. By sequencing 278 paired samples collected at diagnosis and first remission (CR1), we identified 361 mutations in 124 patients at diagnosis and tracked these at CR1. After excluding mutations associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis, 82 mutations in 50 of the 124 patients (40.3%) were detected at CR1. Survival benefit was observed in favor of allogeneic HCT over chemotherapy consolidation in the MRD(pos) subgroup with respect to overall survival (HR 0.294, p = 0.003), relapse-free survival (HR 0.376, p = 0.015) and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR 0.279, p = 0.004) in multivariate analysis, but not in the MRD(neg) subgroup.

SUMMARY: INTRODUCTION: Current treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia allows survival above 80%, but it is also very important to prevent treatment-related side effects and to improve long-term quality of life. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the side effects of chemotherapy on the skeletal system and to identify prognostic and risk factors. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2016, 215 children were treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the 2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University. In our retrospective study, we analyzed data of these children with skeletal-related side-effects (38 children with reduced bone mineral density, 5 with osteonecrosis, 3 with osteomyelitis and 2 with pathologic fracture). RESULTS: Osteodensitometric data, vitamin D, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and lipid levels were collected at different follow-up times. Osteodensitometric values were already reduced at the time of diagnosis (lumbar spine Z-score: -1.5 +/- 1.02) and intensive venous chemotherapy caused further decrease (-1.8 +/- 0.5). Z-score showed an improving tendency at the end of the maintenance therapy (-1.6 +/- 0.5; p<0.05), followed by further improvement later (-1.2 +/- 0.4 [p<0.01] and -0.9 +/- 0.4). Vitamin D levels showed improvement after intensive venous chemotherapy (20 +/- 3.1 ng/ml vs. 31 +/- 2.6 ng/ml at multi-year follow-up; p<001). Phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels did not change considerably during the period considered. Cholesterol levels increased continuously during treatment (at the time of diagnosis 3.28 +/- 0.3 mM/l vs. at the end of the maintenance therapy 4.62 +/- 0.2 mM/l; p<0.0001). A similar trend was observed with HDL cholesterol levels (0.53 +/- 0.09 mM/l vs. 1.48 +/- 0.14 mM/l). CONCLUSION: In summary, we can conclude that follow-up of these children, osteodensitometric measurements and monitoring of laboratory parameters are extremely important, as bone abnormalities can occur in leukemia patients.

However, little is known as to whether alterations in SM concentration or SM species distribution are linked pathological conditions. The present study examined SM concentrations and species profiles in serum taken from patients with hematologic malignancies. Serum was collected from normal subjects and from patients with B-cell lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphatic leukemia/ lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL/LBL). Serum SM species distribution was analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS). Serum lipids concentration were measured using enzymatic assays. Normal and hematologic malignancy sera were similar in terms of total serum SM and phosphatidylcholine (PC) concentrations and SM/PC ratio. However, all hematologic malignancy sera had lower levels of SM species containing saturated odd chain fatty acids (OCFAs) in the side chain compared to normal serum. In addition, the proportion of SM species with saturated (C20 and C22) and mono unsaturated fatty acids (C18, C20, C22) were lower in MDS patient serum compared to normal serum. The present study revealed that the serum SM species profile in patients with hematologic malignancies differed from that of normal subjects despite total serum SM and PC concentrations and SM/PC ratios being similar between the various cancer groups and the normal group.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Future development to try to improve outcomes include combination therapies to reduce the tumor burden prior to starting treatment, combining with immune checkpoint inhibition therapy such as anti-PD-1/PDL1 antibodies, and the use of second generation bispecific antibodies that target two different antigens and recruit other effector cells such as nature killer cells and macrophages.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

However, there is an ongoing search for novel checkpoints with targeting innate immunity via activation of macrophage phagocytosis representing an exciting therapeutic strategy. CD47 is the dominant negative macrophage immune checkpoint expressed on cancer cells which acts as a ""don't eat me signal"", preventing phagocytosis via its interaction with SIRP-alpha on macrophages. CD47 has been shown to be upregulated in many cancer types including myeloid malignancies with increased expression associated with inferior OS. Magrolimab, an anti-CD47 antibody, has shown proof-of-principle of efficacy in this therapeutic class with promising early results in both higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and TP53 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The toxicity profile to date has been shown safe and manageable with on-target anemia related to CD47 being present on aged red blood cells and without evidence of immune related toxicities. Investigation of novel agents targeting this pathway and novel combinations are ongoing.

Many studies have revealed that inflammation has an essential role in the progression of hematopoietic malignancies. Since the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, an important pathway involved in inflammation induction, has previously been associated with solid tumors, we hypothesized that it would be correlated with the pathophysiological characteristics of AML patients and could be considered as an anticancer target. METHOD: We evaluated the mRNA expression of TLR4, MyD88, RelB, and NF-small ka, CyrillicB using qRT-PCR in bone-marrow samples of 40 AML patients categorized into four groups according to prognosis, cell type, age, and drug response. Next, we explored the expression of these genes in three AML cell lines (NB4, U937, and KG-1) and used TAK-242, a specific inhibitor of TLR4, to investigate whether this inhibition could suppress AML cell proliferation using cell-cycle analysis. The effect of TAK-242 on arsenic trioxide (ATO) cytotoxicity was also assessed. RESULT: The results of qRT-PCR showed that most genes had higher expression in patients with poor prognosis or drug-resistant statues. They were also overexpressed in patients with less-differentiated cells. Moreover, TAK-242 inhibited cell proliferation of all the cell lines and altered their cell cycle distribution. It could also intensify the cytotoxicity of ATO in combination therapy.

B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T cells have demonstrated promising effects in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. However, the dynamics of CAR-T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in clinical patients remains unexplored. Here, we longitudinally profiled the transcriptomes of 55,488 T cells including CAR-T products, CAR-T cells, and endogenous T cells at the peak and remission phases in a plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patient treated with BCMA CAR-T cells by single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Our results showed distinct CAR-T and endogenous T cell subsets indicating stage-specific expression in proliferation, cytotoxicity, and intercellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, we found that CAR-T cells at peak phase gradually convert to a highly cytotoxic state from a highly proliferative state along a development trajectory. Moreover, re-analysis of a single cell study from CD8(+) CD19 CAR-T confirmed our findings. These commonalities suggest conserved mechanisms for CAR-T treatment across hematological malignancies. Taken together, our current study provides insight into CAR-T cell dynamics during CAR-T therapy and proves that both BCMA CAR-T and CD19 CAR-T have similar transcriptional characteristics, especially at the CAR-T peak phase.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

The mechanisms by which etoposide induces secondary hematopoietic malignancies are poorly documented. However, etoposide-related leukemogenesis is known to depend on oxidative metabolites of etoposide, notably etoposide quinone, that can react with protein cysteine residues such as in topoisomerases II. CREBBP is a major histone acetyltransferase that functions mainly as a transcriptional co-activator. This epigenetic enzyme is considered as a tumor suppressor that plays a major role in hematopoiesis. Genetic alterations affecting CREBBP activity are highly common in hematopoietic malignancies. We report here that CREBBP is impaired by etoposide quinone. Molecular and kinetic analyses show that this inhibition occurs through the rapid and covalent (kinhib = 16.10(2) M(-1). s(-1)) adduction of etoposide quinone with redox sensitive cysteine residues within the RING and PHD Zn(2+)-fingers of CREBBP catalytic core leading to subsequent release of Zn(2+). In agreement with these findings, experiments conducted in cells and in mice treated with etoposide showed irreversible inhibition of endogenous CREBBP activity and decreased H3K18 and H3K27 acetylation. As shown for topoisomerases II, our work thus suggests that the leukemogenic metabolite etoposide quinone can impair the epigenetic CREBBP acetyltransferase through reaction with redox sensitive cysteine residues.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the outstanding efficacies observed with these agents, these treatments are sometimes discontinued due to toxicity, unresponsiveness, transformation of the disease and/or resistance. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation that protects CLL cells from apoptotic stimuli represents one of molecular mechanisms that underlie the emergence of drug resistance. As prostaglandin E (EP)4 receptor agonists have been shown to successfully inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway in B-cell lymphoma cells, we investigated the potential of the highly specific EP4 receptor agonist L-902688 for the potential treatment of patients with CLL. We show here that low micromolar concentrations of L-902688 can indeed induce selective cytotoxicity towards several B-cell malignancies, including CLL. Moreover, L-902688-mediated activation of the EP4 receptor in patient derived CLL cells resulted in inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway, cell proliferation, and induction of apoptosis. Most importantly, we show for the first time that in combination with ibrutinib, idelalisib, or venetoclax, L-902688 induces synergistic cytotoxic activity against patient derived CLL cells. To conclude, the modulation of NF-kappaB activity by EP4 receptor agonists represents an innovative approach to improve the treatment of patients with CLL. In particular, EP4 receptor agonists appear to represent promising adjuncts to the already existing therapies for patients with CLL due to these promising synergistic activities.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

33278349,NLM,MEDLINE,20210916,1658-3876 (Print),14,3,2021 Sep,New promising developments for potential therapeutic applications of high-dose ascorbate as an anticancer drug.,179-191,"Vitamin C (ascorbate) is an essential dietary requirement, with fundamental redox, anti-oxidant functions at physiologic concentrations. Vitamin C is a cofactor for Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, englobing large families of enzymes, including also epigenetic regulators of DNA and histone methylation. Importantly, vitamin C is involved in the control of the activity of TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes, key epigenetic regulators. For this spectrum of activities, often involving pathways deregulated in cancer cells, vitamin C possesses some pharmacologic activities that can be exploited in anticancer therapy. In particular, the capacity of pharmacological doses of vitamin C to target redox imbalance and to rescue deregulated epigenetic program observed in some cancer cells represents a consistent therapeutic potentiality. Several recent studies have identified some cancer subsets that could benefit from the pharmacological activities of vitamin C. The identification of these potentially responsive patients will help to carefully define controlled clinical trials aiming to evaluate the anticancer activity of Vitamin C.","['Copyright (c) 2020 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

L-asparaginases are immunogenic and can induce hypersensitivity reactions; inability to receive asparaginase has been associated with poor patient outcomes. There are L-asparaginases of varied bacterial origins, with the most commonly used being Escherichia coli (E. coli); therefore, to ensure that patients who develop hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginases receive an adequate therapeutic course, alternative preparations are warranted. JZP-458 is a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase produced using a novel Pseudomonas fluorescens expression platform that yields an enzyme with no immunologic cross-reactivity to E. coli-derived asparaginases. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of JZP-458, a randomized, single-center, open-label, phase I study was conducted with JZP-458 given via i.m. injection or i.v. infusion to healthy adult volunteers. At the highest doses tested for each route of administration (i.e., 25 mg/m(2) i.m. and 37.5 mg/m(2) i.v.), JZP-458 achieved serum asparaginase activity (SAA) levels >/= 0.1 IU/mL at 72 hours postdose for 100% of volunteers. Bioavailability for i.m. JZP-458 was estimated at 36.8% based on SAA data. All dose levels were well-tolerated, with no unanticipated adverse events (AEs), no serious AEs, and no grade 3 or higher AEs. Based on PK and safety data, the recommended JZP-458 starting dose for the pivotal phase II/III study in adult and pediatric patients is 25 mg/m(2) i.m. and 37.5 mg/m(2) i.v. on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday dosing schedule.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Patients with cancer, and especially those with hematologic malignancies, may be at especially high risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality resulting from COVID-19 infection. The ASH Research Collaborative COVID-19 Registry for Hematology was developed to study features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with underlying blood disorders, such as hematologic malignancies. At the time of this report, data from 250 patients with blood cancers from 74 sites around the world had been entered into the registry. The most commonly represented malignancies were acute leukemia (33%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and myeloma or amyloidosis (16%). Patients presented with a myriad of symptoms, most frequently fever (73%), cough (67%), dyspnea (50%), and fatigue (40%). Use of COVID-19-directed therapies, such as hydroxychloroquine (n = 76) or azithromycin (n = 59), was common. Overall mortality was 28%. Patients with a physician-estimated prognosis from the underlying hematologic malignancy of <12 months at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and those with relapsed/refractory disease experienced a higher proportion of moderate/severe COVID-19 disease and death. In some instances, death occurred after a decision was made to forgo intensive care unit admission in favor of a palliative approach. Taken together, these data support the emerging consensus that patients with hematologic malignancies experience significant morbidity and mortality resulting from COVID-19 infection.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has a propensity for occurring in composite lymphomas, a phenomenon that remains to be elucidated. We applied cytogenetics, droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, and massively parallel sequencing to analyze longitudinally a patient with CLL, who 3 years later showed transformation to a hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V). Outgrowth of the IGHV4-34-positive HCL-V clone at the expense of the initially dominant CLL clone with trisomy 12 and MED12 mutation started before CLL-guided treatment and was accompanied by a TP53 mutation, which was already detectable at diagnosis of CLL. Furthermore, deep sequencing of IGH showed a composite lymphoma with presence of both disease components at all analyzed timepoints (down to a minor clone: major clone ratio of ~1:1000). Overall, our analyses showed a disease course that resembled clonal dynamics reported for malignancies with intratumoral heterogeneity and illustrate the utility of deep sequencing of IGH to detect distinct clonal populations at diagnosis, monitor clonal response to therapy, and possibly improve clinical outcomes.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Locher, Maurus', 'Jukic, Emina', 'Bohn, Jan-Paul', 'Untergasser, Gerold', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Cramer, Christian Andreas', 'Schwendinger, Simon', 'Vogi, Verena', 'Verdorfer, Irmgard', 'Witsch-Baumgartner, Martina', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Gunsilius, Eberhard', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Zschocke, Johannes', 'Steiner, Normann']","['Locher M', 'Jukic E', 'Bohn JP', 'Untergasser G', 'Steurer M', 'Cramer CA', 'Schwendinger S', 'Vogi V', 'Verdorfer I', 'Witsch-Baumgartner M', 'Nachbaur D', 'Gunsilius E', 'Wolf D', 'Zschocke J', 'Steiner N']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Center for Human Genetics, Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical Clinic III, Oncology, Hematology, Immuno-Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201212,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,PMC7984250,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*HCL-V', '*IGHV', '*clonal dynamics', '*composite lymphoma']",,2020/12/06 06:00,2020/12/06 06:00,['2020/12/05 05:34'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/05 05:34 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2021 Apr;60(4):287-292. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22925.

Cellular experiments demonstrated that both inhibitors induced cell death with caspase activation and cell cycle arrest, however only the GW806742X inhibitor decreased with more efficacy AURKA and AURKB expression in K-562 leukemia cells. In ALL patients both AURKA and AURKB showed a significant overexpression, when compared to health controls. Moreover, AURKB expression level was significant higher than AURKA in patients, and predicted a poorer prognosis with significantly lower survival rates. No differences were found in AURKA and AURKB expression between gene fusions, immunophenotypic groups, white blood cells count, gender or age. In summary, the results in this study indicates that the AURKA and AURKB overexpression are important findings in pediatric ALL, and designed inhibitor, GW806742X tested in vitro were able to effectively inhibit the gene expression of both aurora kinases and induce apoptosis in K-562 cells, however our data clearly shown that AURKB proves to be a singular finding and potential prognostic biomarker that may be used as a promising therapeutic target to those patients.",,"['Moreira-Nunes, Caroline Aquino', 'Mesquita, Felipe Pantoja', 'Portilho, Adrhyann Jullyanne de Sousa', 'Mello Junior, Fernando Augusto Rodrigues', 'Maues, Jersey Heitor da Silva', 'Pantoja, Laudreisa da Costa', 'Wanderley, Alayde Vieira', 'Khayat, Andre Salim', 'Zuercher, William J', 'Montenegro, Raquel Carvalho', 'de Moraes-Filho, Manoel Odorico', 'de Moraes, Maria Elisabete Amaral']","['Moreira-Nunes CA', 'Mesquita FP', 'Portilho AJS', 'Mello Junior FAR', 'Maues JHDS', 'Pantoja LDC', 'Wanderley AV', 'Khayat AS', 'Zuercher WJ', 'Montenegro RC', 'de Moraes-Filho MO', 'de Moraes MEA']","['Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Coronel Nunes de Melo st, n 1000, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, CE, CEP: 60416-000, Brazil. carolfam@gmail.com.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Coronel Nunes de Melo st, n 1000, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, CE, CEP: 60416-000, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Coronel Nunes de Melo st, n 1000, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, CE, CEP: 60416-000, Brazil.', 'Molecular Biology Laboratory, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem, PA, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Human Cytogenetics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Para, Belem, PA, Brazil.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Octavio Lobo Children's Hospital, Belem, PA, Brazil."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Octavio Lobo Children's Hospital, Belem, PA, Brazil."", 'Oncology Research Center, Joao de Barros Barreto University Hospital, Federal University of Para, Belem, PA, Brazil.', 'Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Coronel Nunes de Melo st, n 1000, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, CE, CEP: 60416-000, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Coronel Nunes de Melo st, n 1000, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, CE, CEP: 60416-000, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Federal University of Ceara, Coronel Nunes de Melo st, n 1000, Rodolfo Teofilo, Fortaleza, CE, CEP: 60416-000, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201204,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC7718893,,,,2020/12/06 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/12/05 05:29'],"['2020/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/05 05:29 [entrez]', '2020/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Dec 4;10(1):21272. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-78024-8.,20210329,10.1038/s41598-020-78024-8 [doi],"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)']",IM,"['Aurora Kinase A/*metabolism', 'Aurora Kinase B/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Protein Interaction Maps']","['10.1038/s41598-020-78024-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-78024-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is accumulating evidence that these relapse-inducing cells are maintained and protected by signals provided by the microenvironment. Thus, inhibition of niche signals is a proposed strategy to target leukemia stem cells but this requires knowledge of the critical signals and may be subject to compensatory mechanisms. Signals from the niche require receptor-mediated endocytosis, a generic process dependent on the Dynamin family of large GTPases. Here, we show that Dynole 34-2, a potent inhibitor of Dynamin GTPase activity, can block transduction of key signalling pathways and overcome chemoresistance of leukemia stem cells.

Stimulation of wild-type T cells in vitro and in vivo with allo-antigens enhances autophagy. To assess the relevance of autophagy to T-cell allo-immunity, we generated T-cell-specific Atg5 knock-out mice. Deficiency of ATG5-dependent autophagy reduced T-cell proliferation and increased apoptosis following in vitro and in vivo allo-stimulation. The absence of ATG5 in allo-stimulated T cells enhanced their ability to release effector cytokines and cytotoxic functions, uncoupling their proliferation and effector functions. Absence of autophagy reduced intracellular degradation of cytotoxic enzymes such as granzyme B, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of T cells. In several in vivo models of allo-HSCT, ATG5-dependent dissociation of T-cell functions contributed to significant reduction in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) but retained sufficient graft versus tumor (GVT) response. Our findings demonstrate that ATG5-dependent autophagy uncouples T-cell proliferation from its effector functions and offers a potential new strategy to enhance outcomes after allo-HSCT.

We compared survival of 25,523 non-Hispanic Black and White adults with AML using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program data and performed mutational profiling of 1,339 patients with AML treated on frontline Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) protocols. Black patients had shorter survival than White patients, both in SEER and in the setting of Alliance clinical trials. The disparity was especially pronounced in Black patients <60 years, after adjustment for socioeconomic (SEER) and molecular (Alliance) factors. Black race was an independent prognosticator of poor survival. Gene mutation profiles showed fewer NPM1 and more IDH2 mutations in younger Black patients. Overall survival of younger Black patients was adversely affected by IDH2 mutations and FLT3-ITD, but, in contrast to White patients, was not improved by NPM1 mutations. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that young Black patients have not benefited as much as White patients from recent progress in AML treatment in the United States. Our data suggest that both socioeconomic factors and differences in disease biology contribute to the survival disparity and need to be urgently addressed.See related commentary by Vyas, p. 540.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 521.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Bhatnagar, Bhavana', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Zhao, Qiuhong', 'Fisher, James L', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Walker, Christopher J', 'Mims, Alice S', 'Oakes, Christopher', 'Giacopelli, Brian', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Boateng, Isaiah', 'Blachly, James S', 'Maharry, Sophia E', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Paskett, Electra D', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin']","['Bhatnagar B', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Mrozek K', 'Zhao Q', 'Fisher JL', 'Nicolet D', 'Walker CJ', 'Mims AS', 'Oakes C', 'Giacopelli B', 'Orwick S', 'Boateng I', 'Blachly JS', 'Maharry SE', 'Carroll AJ', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Stone RM', 'Byrd JC', 'Paskett ED', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Garzon R', 'Eisfeld AK']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.

To minimise graft failure and relapse after CBT, intensification of conditioning by the addition of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (CA) and concomitant continuous use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are reported to convey a significantly better survival after CBT in some retrospective studies. To confirm the effect of G-CSF plus CA combination, in addition to the standard conditioning regimen, cyclophosphamide (CY)/total body irradiation (TBI), we design a randomised controlled study comparing CA/CY/TBI with versus without G-CSF priming (G-CSF combined conditioned cord blood transplantation [G-CONCORD] study). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase III study that aimed to compare G-CSF+CA/CY/TBI as a conditioning regimen for CBT with CA/CY/TBI. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, aged 16-55 years, are eligible. The target sample size is 160 and the registration period is 4 years. The primary endpoint is the 2-year disease-free survival rate after CBT. The secondary endpoints are overall survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, engraftment rate, time to neutrophil recovery, short-term adverse events, incidence of infections and causes of death.This study employs a single one-to-one web-based randomisation between the with-G-CSF versus without-G-CSF groups after patient registration. Combination of high-dose CA and CY/TBI in both groups is used for conditioning. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the central review board, Nagoya University Certified Review Board, after the enforcement of the Clinical Trials Act in Japan. The manuscripts presenting data from this study will be submitted for publication in quality peer-reviewed medical journals. Study findings will be disseminated via presentations at national/international conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

The objective of the study was to assess disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with ALL according with MRD status at the end of induction therapy in a Colombian population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed a retrospective cohort to compare DFS and OS in adults with de novo ALL according to MRD status at the end of induction chemotherapy, and the type of postinduction consolidation strategy used. RESULTS: A total of 165 adults with ALL were included in the MRD part of the study, 73 patients in the MRD-negative group and 92 in the MRD-positive group. Median DFS for the MRD-positive group was 11 months (95% confidence interval, 11.7-22.2) and was not reached for the MRD-negative group (P < .001). At 3 years, DFS was 18% and 55%, respectively (P < .001). The median OS for MRD-positive patients was 16 months (95% confidence interval, 8.8-23.15) and was not reached in the MRD-negative group. At 3 years, OS was 26% and 51% for the former and latter group, respectively. Among subjects who did not receive a transplant, median DFS was 21 months for MRD-negative patients and 9 months for MRD-positive patients (P < .001). The median DFS was not reached in either group, whereas 3-year DFS was 64% for MRD-negative and 70% for MRD-positive patients who underwent transplantation in first remission (P = .861). CONCLUSION: MRD status at the end of induction is an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS in adult ALL.

The clinical picture consists of generalized confluent papular eruptions with possible systemic manifestations, which may be fatal as it still constitutes a therapeutic dilemma. Histologically, it is characterized by dermal mucin deposition, fibroblast proliferation with fibrosis, with monoclonal gammopathy in the absence of thyroid disease. Some atypical forms of the disease were reported in the literature, but none were reported in acute leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of a 21 years old female patient, known case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who developed numerous hyper-pigmented erythematous papules and plaques, mainly over her thighs, lower abdomen, and sub-mammary flexures. Histopathology of skin lesions confirmed the diagnosis of atypical scleromyxedema. Her symptoms significantly improved with the use of high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). CONCLUSIONS: Despite that scleromyxedema is associated with many hematologic disorders, it is very rarely associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and a high index of suspicion is needed for diagnosis.

Therefore, there is a need for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents that could treat AML effectively. Radotinib, an oral BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was developed as a drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Previously, we reported that radotinib exerts increased cytotoxic effects towards AML cells. However, little is known about the effects of combining radotinib with Ara-C, a conventional chemotherapeutic agent for AML, with respect to cell death in AML cells. Therefore, we investigated combination effects of radotinib and Ara-C on AML in this study. METHODS: Synergistic anti-cancer effects of radotinib and Ara-C in AML cells including HL60, HEL92.1.7, THP-1 and bone marrow cells from AML patients have been examined. Diverse cell biological assays such as cell viability assay, Annexin V-positive cells, caspase-3 activity, cell cycle distribution, and related signaling pathway have been performed. RESULTS: The combination of radotinib and Ara-C was found to induce AML cell apoptosis, which involved the mitochondrial pathway. In brief, combined radotinib and Ara-C significantly induced Annexin V-positive cells, cytosolic cytochrome C, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in AML cells including HL60, HEL92.1.7, and THP-1. In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential and Bcl-xl protein were markedly decreased by radotinib and Ara-C. Moreover, this combination induced caspase-3 activity. Cleaved caspase-3, 7, and 9 levels were also increased by combined radotinib and Ara-C. Additionally, radotinib and Ara-C co-treatment induced G0/G1 arrest via the induction of CDKIs such as p21 and p27 and the inhibition of CDK2 and cyclin E. Thus, radotinib/Ara-C induces mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest via the regulation of the CDKI-CDK-cyclin cascade in AML cells. In addition, our results showed that combined treatment with radotinib and Ara-C inhibits AML cell growth, including tumor volumes and weights in vivo. Also, the combination of radotinib and Ara-C can sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin or idarubicin in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our results can be concluded that radotinib in combination with Ara-C possesses a strong anti-AML activity.",,"['Heo, Sook-Kyoung', 'Noh, Eui-Kyu', 'Yu, Ho-Min', 'Kim, Do Kyoung', 'Seo, Hye Jin', 'Lee, Yoo Jin', 'Cheon, Jaekyung', 'Koh, Su Jin', 'Min, Young Joo', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol']","['Heo SK', 'Noh EK', 'Yu HM', 'Kim DK', 'Seo HJ', 'Lee YJ', 'Cheon J', 'Koh SJ', 'Min YJ', 'Choi Y', 'Jo JC']","['Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. choiysmd@gmail.com.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. jcjo97@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. jcjo97@hanmail.net.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201204,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC7718665,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Anti-leukemic activity', 'Ara-C', 'Cytarabine', 'Radotinib']",,2020/12/06 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/12/05 05:20'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/05 05:20 [entrez]', '2020/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Dec 4;20(1):1193. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07701-8.,20210419,10.1186/s12885-020-07701-8 [doi],"['0', '(4-methyl-N-(3-(4-methylimidazol-1-yl)-5-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-(4-pyrazin-2-yl', 'pyrimidin-2-ylamino)benzamide)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Random Allocation', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07701-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07701-8 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6014-7977'],,"['2017R1A1A3A04069314/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'UUHBRC-2016-001/Ulsan University Hospital', 'UUH-2019-06/Ulsan University Hospital']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PJP was the most common cause of infectious death in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia prior to the inclusion of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis as part of the standard medical care in the late 1980s. Children with acute leukemia, lymphomas, and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially allogeneic transplantation, are also at high risk of PJP. Persistent lymphopenia, graft versus host disease, poor immune reconstitution, and lengthy use of corticosteroids are significant risk factors for PJP. Active infection may be due to reactivation of latent infection or recent acquisition from environmental exposure. Intense hypoxemia and impaired diffusing capacity of the lungs are hallmarks of PJP, while computerized tomography of the lungs is the diagnostic technique of choice. Immunofluorescence testing with monoclonal antibodies followed by fluorescent microscopy and polymerase chain reaction testing of respiratory specimens have emerged as the best diagnostic methods. Measurement of (1-3)-beta-D-glucan in the serum has a high negative predictive value in ruling out PJP. Oral cotrimoxazole is effective for prophylaxis, but in intolerant patients, intravenous and aerosolized pentamidine, dapsone, and atovaquone are effective alternatives. Iotantravenous cotrimoxazole is the treatment of choice, but PJP has a high mortality even with appropriate therapy.",,"['Mantadakis, Elpis']",['Mantadakis E'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology/Oncology Unit, University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, 68 100 Alexandroupolis, Thrace, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201202,Switzerland,J Fungi (Basel),"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",101671827,PMC7761543,['NOTNLM'],"['Pneumocystis jirovecii', 'Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)', 'atovaquone', 'bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)', 'children', 'cotrimoxazole', 'dapsone', 'leukemia', 'pentamidine']",,2020/12/06 06:00,2020/12/06 06:01,['2020/12/05 01:01'],"['2020/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/05 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/06 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,J Fungi (Basel). 2020 Dec 2;6(4). pii: jof6040331. doi: 10.3390/jof6040331.,,E331 [pii] 10.3390/jof6040331 [doi],,,,"['jof6040331 [pii]', '10.3390/jof6040331 [doi]']",,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7837-9733'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cells are the main cell effectors of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that mediates antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Hence, it is relevant to understand NK physiology and status to investigate the biological effect of mAbs in the clinic. NK cells are heterogeneous with multiple subsets that may have specific activity against different attacks. The presence of viral-sculpted NK cell populations has already been described, but the presence of cancer-sculpted NK cells remains unknown. Cancer induces a broad NK cell dysfunction, which has not been linked to a specific population. Here, we investigated the NK cell population by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embed maps in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients at diagnosis and at least 30 days after treatment, which correlates with tumor cell clearance. We found that the NK lineage largely responded to the tumor by generating antitumor NK cells and renewing the population with a subset of immature NK cells. However, we failed to identify a specific ""memory-like"" subset with the NK cell markers used. Moreover, in patients in relapse, we found essentially the same NK populations as those found at diagnosis, suggesting that NK cells equally respond to the first or second tumor rise. Finally, we observed that previous cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection largely affects the tumor-associated changes in NK population, but the CMV-associated CD57(+)NKG2C(+) NK cell population does not appear to play any role in tumor immunity.",,"['Vo, Dang-Nghiem', 'Constantinides, Michael', 'Allende-Vega, Nerea', 'Alexia, Catherine', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Vo DN', 'Constantinides M', 'Allende-Vega N', 'Alexia C', 'Cartron G', 'Villalba M']","['IRMB, University Montpellier, INSERM, 34295 Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, University Montpellier, INSERM, 34295 Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, CHU Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, University Montpellier, INSERM, 34295 Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, University Montpellier, INSERM, 34295 Montpellier, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France."", 'IRMB, University Montpellier, INSERM, 34295 Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, CHU Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, University Montpellier, INSERM, CNRS, CHU Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201202,Switzerland,Vaccines (Basel),Vaccines,101629355,PMC7761578,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Hodgkin lymphoma', 'NK cells', 'UMAP', 'trogocytosis']",,2020/12/06 06:00,2020/12/06 06:01,['2020/12/05 01:01'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/05 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/06 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Vaccines (Basel). 2020 Dec 2;8(4). pii: vaccines8040727. doi: 10.3390/vaccines8040727.,,E727 [pii] 10.3390/vaccines8040727 [doi],,,,"['vaccines8040727 [pii]', '10.3390/vaccines8040727 [doi]']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4385-4888'],,"['2017/La Ligue Regionale contre le Cancer', 'PRT-K 2018-021/INCA', 'ANR-10-LABX-53/ANR', 'NK-001/Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional "" (FEDER-FSE-IEJ 2014/2020)', 'HEMODIAG_2020/Region Languedoc Roussillon', 'ANR-10-INBS-04/ANR', 'Emergence (MV; 2018/2019)/Canceropole GSO']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognostication, response criteria, therapeutic management of patients, efficacy of established and novel treatment modalities are thoroughly reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations in genes involved in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, and cell-signaling are abundant in CMML and implicated in its complex pathogenesis. As presence of these mutations carry a prognostic impact, they are increasingly incorporated in risk-stratification schemes. Novel response criteria have been proposed, considering the unique features of the disease. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only treatment with curative intent, it is reserved for a minority of patients; therefore, there is an unmet need for optimizing treatment modalities, such as hypomethylating agents, and introducing novel agents, which could substantially improve survival and quality of life of CMML patients.

This category consists of 5 neoplastic subtypes: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), BCR-ABL1-negative atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), MDS/MPN-ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), and MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (U). Cytogenetic abnormalities and somatic copy number variations are uncommon; however, >90% patients harbor gene mutations. Although no single gene mutation is specific to a disease subtype, certain mutational signatures in the context of appropriate clinical and morphological features can be used to establish a diagnosis. In CMML, mutated coexpression of TET2 and SRSF2 results in clonal hematopoiesis skewed toward monocytosis, and the ensuing acquisition of driver mutations including ASXL1, NRAS, and CBL results in overt disease. MDS/MPN-RS-T demonstrates features of SF3B1-mutant MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS), with the development of thrombocytosis secondary to the acquisition of signaling mutations, most commonly JAK2V617F. JMML, the only pediatric entity, is a bona fide RASopathy, with germline and somatic mutations occurring in the oncogenic RAS pathway giving rise to disease. BCR-ABL1-negative aCML is characterized by dysplastic neutrophilia and is enriched in SETBP1 and ETNK1 mutations, whereas MDS/MPN-U is the least defined and lacks a characteristic mutational signature. Molecular profiling also provides prognostic information, with truncating ASXL1 mutations being universally detrimental and germline CBL mutations in JMML showing spontaneous regression. Sequencing information in certain cases can help identify potential targeted therapies (IDH1, IDH2, and splicing mutations) and should be a mainstay in the diagnosis and management of these neoplasms.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Lasho, Terra L']","['Patnaik MM', 'Lasho TL']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Because of the favorable outcome of most patients with CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a greater number of comorbidities might be the most significant adverse feature for long-term survival. The presence of comorbidities may also affect the risk of developing adverse events with TKIs. This effect is perhaps best exemplified by the risk of developing arterio-occlusive events, which is greatest for patients who have other risk factors for such events, with the risk increasing with higher numbers of comorbidities. The coexistence of comorbidities in patients with CML not only may affect TKI selection but also demands close monitoring of the overall health condition of the patient to optimize safety and provide the opportunity for an optimal outcome to such patients.

Restrictive transfusion approaches are often practised, but whether these are appropriate for outpatients with MDS, who are often older and may be frail, is not known. Current schedules for transfusion-dependent patients are burdensome, necessitating frequent visits to hospitals for sample collection and blood administration.

The 2005 discovery of the driver mutation JAK2V617F, found in more than 70% of individuals with MPNs and 98% of those with PV, has transformed the diagnosis and management of MPNs. Although PV is the most common phenotype associated with JAK2V617F, roughly 60% of individuals with ET or PMF also have the mutation, and JAK2V617F is now recognized as a common lesion in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). JAK2V617F+ CH and MPN are indolent disorders that evolve over time, with transitions to different disease phases, transformation to bone marrow failure or leukemia, and high thrombosis rates. Genomic assessment has taken center stage as an important tool to define disease phenotype, disease burden, prognosis, and even thrombosis risk of MPNs. Genomics has also unveiled the causes and factors that modify the risk of acquiring and expanding CH and MPNs and points to new pathways for targeted therapies to treat and ultimately prevent them.

Randomized trials that demonstrated efficacy of these agents in the relapsed/refractory setting rarely included patients with prior novel agent exposure. Herein, we review available data, including single-arm prospective studies and retrospective cohorts, on outcomes for novel agent approaches after novel agent exposure. We examine data for subsequent treatment options in 3 specific scenarios: (1) progression of disease while receiving BTKi, (2) progression of disease after discontinuation of BTKi for intolerance, and (3) after treatment with venetoclax. Data are most robust for venetoclax-based regimens after progression on BTKi. For patients who experience progression of disease after discontinuation of BTKi for intolerance, venetoclax-based regimens and retreatment with BTKi (depending on severity of initial intolerance) are 2 data-driven options. After frontline venetoclax/obinutuzumab, subsequent treatment approaches depend on whether patients experience progression of disease during or after discontinuation of their fixed duration frontline regimen and whether venetoclax/obinutuzumab was discontinued for intolerance. After progression of disease while on venetoclax, we recommend BTKi as second-line therapy. For patients who experience progression after completion or premature discontinuation (because of intolerance) of fixed duration venetoclax/obinutuzumab, either BTKi or retreatment with venetoclax (with aggressive supportive care if prior intolerance) are reasonable considerations. Subsequent lines of therapy in these scenarios include PI3Ki and consideration of cellular therapies.

Traditionally, the field has turned to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with poor outcomes. While HSCT confers a survival benefit for several B-ALL populations, often HSCT becomes standard-of-care in subsets of de novo ALL with poor risk features despite limited or no data showing a survival benefit in these populations, yet the additive morbidity and mortality can be substantial. With the advent of targeted immunotherapies and the transformative impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells on relapsed or refractory B-ALL, this approach is currently under investigation in frontline therapy for a subset of patients with poor-risk B-ALL: high-risk B-ALL with persistent minimal residual disease at the end of consolidation, which has been designated very high risk. Comparisons of these 2 approaches are fraught with issues, including single-arm trials, differing eligibility criteria, comparisons to historical control populations, and vastly different toxicity profiles. Nevertheless, much can be learned from available data and ongoing trials. We will review data for HSCT for pediatric B-ALL in first remission and the efficacy of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory B-ALL, and we will discuss an ongoing international phase 2 clinical trial of CD19 CAR T cells for very-high-risk B-ALL in first remission.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Diorio, Caroline', 'Maude, Shannon L']","['Diorio C', 'Maude SL']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have qualitative and quantitative deficits in granulocytes predisposing to bacterial and fungal infections. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia results in qualitative deficits in lymphocytes, resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced cell-mediated immunity predisposing to certain bacterial and viral as well as fungal infections. Chemotherapeutic regimens often compound these deficits, result in prolonged periods of severe neutropenia, and disrupt mucosal barriers, further elevating infection risk. Despite advances in antimicrobial therapies and prophylaxis, acute leukemia patients with disease- and treatment-related immunosuppression remain at risk for life-threatening infection, including with resistant organisms, antimicrobial-related adverse events, and higher treatment costs. Additionally, our knowledge of infection risk and drug-drug interactions with new immune-targeted cancer therapeutics is evolving.

Genetic testing, which is rapidly becoming a common feature of both clinical care and research in hematology, adds additional layers of complexity to each of these consent elements. Using the example case of Mr. Smith, a man with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia whose clinicians offer him genetic testing of the leukemia through a clinical trial, I highlight the challenges and controversies of informed consent for genetic testing, focusing on each consent element as it pertains to genetic testing in such a setting.

By targeting this critical kinase in proximal B-cell receptor signaling, BTK inhibitors (BTKis) impair cell proliferation, migration, and activation of NF-kappaB. Clinically, because indefinite inhibition is a mainstay of therapy, there is an extended period of exposure in which adverse effects can develop. Given the impressive efficacy and activity of BTKis in the treatment of patients with CLL, appropriate management of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) is of paramount importance. Here we review the BTKi landscape and present the available toxicity and safety data for each agent. The long-term toxicity profile of ibrutinib, a first-in-class inhibitor, is well characterized and includes a clinically significant incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, infection, diarrhea, arthralgias, and hypertension. Acalabrutinib, the initial second-generation BTKi to earn approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, demonstrates improved kinase selectivity for BTK, with commonly observed adverse reactions including infection, headache, and diarrhea. Mediated by both on-target inhibition of BTK and variable off-target inhibition of other kinases including interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), tyrosine-protein kinase (TEC), and endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), the toxicity profile of BTKis is closely linked to their pattern of kinase binding. Other emerging BTKis include second-generation agents with variable degrees of kinase selectivity and third-generation agents that exhibit reversible noncovalent binding to BTK. We also highlight critical considerations for the prevention and monitoring of AEs and offer practical management strategies for treatment-emergent toxicities.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Lipsky, Andrew', 'Lamanna, Nicole']","['Lipsky A', 'Lamanna N']","['Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Younger age, more frequent receipt of chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation, and differences in comorbidities and socioeconomic factors may partially account for these differences. With new therapeutic options including oral small molecule inhibitors and parenteral drugs suitable for outpatient administration, there is increasing interest from patients and physicians in treating AML in the community setting and avoiding referral to academic centers. This may be particularly true for older adults, for whom treatment rates in the community have historically been low, and for those with comorbidities, because treatment benefits are estimated to be low, and thus travel to academic centers is perceived as especially burdensome. How the volume-outcome relationship is affected by the shift of the treatment landscape in AML over the last few years is unknown. Additionally, improvements in supportive care (transfusion support, broad-spectrum oral antimicrobials), resulting in gradually decreasing early death rates over time, and the growing focus on the impact of AML therapy on quality of life and treatment cost concerns further fuel the larger trend toward an increasing proportion of care delivered in the outpatient setting.

Treatment possibilities for patients with CLL in whom CIT fails whose disease progresses after initial CIT include pathway inhibitors (PIs) and, for selected patients, cellular therapy (ie, allogeneic stem cell transplant, chimeric antigen receptor T cells). PIs (ie, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, and BCL2 inhibitors) are revolutionizing the treatment of CLL. PIs have proved to be more effective than CIT, both as upfront therapy and for relapsed/refractory disease, largely because they may overcome the negative impact of adverse biomarkers (eg, TP53 aberrations, unmutated IGHV) on outcomes and because of their acceptable toxicity.

They consist of four adult onset entities including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), MDS/MPN-ring sideroblasts-thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), BCR-ABL1 negative atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U); with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) being the only pediatric onset entity. Among these overlap neoplasms, CMML is the most frequent and is hallmarked by the presence of sustained peripheral blood monocytosis with recurrent mutations involving TET2 (60%), SRSF2 (50%) and ASXL1 (40%); with RAS pathway mutations and JAK2V617F being relatively enriched in proliferative CMML subtypes (WBC >/=13 x 109/L). CMML usually presents in the 7th decade of life, with a male preponderance and is associated with a median overall survival of <36 months. Adverse prognosticators in CMML include increasing age, high WBC, presence of circulating immature myeloid cells, anemia, thrombocytopenia and truncating ASXL1 mutations. While allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option, given the late onset of this neoplasm and high frequency of comorbidities, most patients remain ineligible. Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, decitabine and oral decitabine/cedazuridine have been US FDA approved for the management of CMML, with overall response rates of 40-50% and complete remission rates of <20%. While these agents epigenetically restore hematopoiesis in a subset of responding patients, they do not impact mutational allele burdens and eventual disease progression to AML remains inevitable.

The arrival of targeted agents into our armamentarium, along with the advent of novel monoclonal antibodies that can achieve deeper remissions, has steered the field to a new treatment paradigm. Given the panoply of therapeutic options available, the question arises whether chemotherapy still has a role in the management of CLL. The novel targeted agents, which include the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, along with the B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, are highly effective in achieving a response with improved remission duration and survival, particularly in high-risk patients. Despite this major progress, the new agents bring a unique set of toxicities unlike those associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is a paucity of head-to-head comparisons among all of the novel agents, because their approval was based on randomization against traditional chemoimmunotherapeutic regimens. Parallel to the increase in the number of available targeted agents, there has been a significant improvement in quality of life and life expectancy of the patients with a CLL diagnosis over the last decade.

We recently developed and reported the synthesis of a first molecule called 17 f that selectively inhibits STAT5 signaling in myeloid leukemia cells and overcomes their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. To improve the antileukemic effect of 17 f, we synthesized ten analogs of this molecule and analyzed their impact on cell growth, survival, chemoresistance and STAT5 signaling. Two compounds, 7 a and 7 a', were identified as having similar or higher antileukemic effects in various AML and CML cell lines.

Herein, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature and analyzed clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through searching PubMed until June 03, 2020, we identified 16 relevant case studies (33 cases) from a total of 45 studies that have reported on patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancies. We investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics including type of hematologic malignancies, initial symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Then, we compared those characteristics and outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 to the general population infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median age was 66-year-old. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common type of hematologic malignancy (39.4%). Fever was the most common symptom (75.9%). Most patients had normal leukocyte counts (55.6%), lymphocytosis (45.4%), and normal platelet counts (68.8%). In comparison to patients with COVID-19 without underlying hematologic malignancies, dyspnea was more prevalent (45.0 vs. 24.9%, p=0.025). Leukocytosis (38.9 vs. 9.8%, p=0.001), lymphocytosis (45.4 vs. 8.2%, p=0.001), and thrombocytopenia (31.3 vs. 11.4%, p=0.036) were significantly more prevalent and lymphopenia (18.2 vs. 57.4%, p=0.012) less prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies. There were no clinical and laboratory characteristics predicting mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Mortality was much higher in patients with hematologic malignancies compared to those without this condition (40.0 vs. 3.6%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Co-occurrence of hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 is rare. However, due to the high mortality rate from COVID-19 in this vulnerable population, further investigation on tailored treatment and management is required.",,"['Kim, J S', 'Lee, K H', 'Kim, G E', 'Kim, S', 'Yang, J W', 'Li, H', 'Hong, S H', 'Ghayda, R A', 'Kronbichler, A', 'Koyanagi, A', 'Jacob, L', 'Shin, J I', 'Smith, L']","['Kim JS', 'Lee KH', 'Kim GE', 'Kim S', 'Yang JW', 'Li H', 'Hong SH', 'Ghayda RA', 'Kronbichler A', 'Koyanagi A', 'Jacob L', 'Shin JI', 'Smith L']","['Department of Nephrology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, interferon, and targeted therapy are the main treatment methods for CML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are also a treatment option, and patients are currently recommended to take these drugs throughout their lives to prevent CML recurrence. Therefore, there is a need to investigate and identify other potential chemotherapy drugs. Currently, research on CML treatment with a single drug has shown little progress. Fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved drug used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, has also shown great potential in the treatment of lymphocytic leukemia. In our study, we find that FTY720 and curcumol have a significant inhibitory effect on K562 cells, K562/ADR cells, and CD34(+) cells from CML patients. RNAseq data analysis shows that regulation of apoptosis and differentiation pathways are key pathways in this process. Besides, BCR/ABL-Jak2/STAT3 signaling, PI3K/Akt-Jnk signaling, and activation of BH3-only genes are involved in CML inhibition. In a K562 xenograft mouse model, therapy with curcumol and FTY720 led to significant inhibition of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis.

Testicular epidermoid cysts are rare benign tumors affecting the testes. We report a case of bilateral testicular epidermoid cysts in a 30-year-old man known to have Klinefelter syndrome. He had an incidental finding of bilateral hard irregular-surfaced testes during routine assessment for testosterone replacement therapy. Biochemical investigation confirmed primary hypogonadism and ultrasound imaging demonstrated bilateral solid testicular masses with no blood flow seen within the lesions. The patient went on to have a right-sided radical orchiectomy with left-side sparing. The histology revealed features in keeping with that of a testicular epidermoid cyst with no evidence of malignancy. The patient was commenced on testosterone replacement therapy.

We present here a 68-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who is admitted for a two-week history of abdominal pain and three days of anuria, despite adequate fluid intake. Laboratory values yielded a greatly elevated leukocyte count with a lymphocytic predominance and smudge cells. Potassium, phosphorus, and uric acid were also significantly increased. EKG revealed peaked T-waves. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of an abnormal B-cell population consistent with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with the following markers: CD19+, CD20+, CD23+, CD5+, CD10-. He was diagnosed with CLL and treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, allopurinol and rasburicase. The patient had another similar episode within one month.

One of the greater success stories in this respect has been Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM), which is an incurable B-cell neoplasm characterized by serum monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) and clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells infiltrating the bone marrow. Recent years have succeeded to describe the molecular landscape of WM in detail, highlighting two recurrently mutated genes, the MYD88 and the CXCR4 genes: MYD88 with an almost constant and recurrent point mutation present in over 90% of patients and CXCR4 with over 40 different mutations in the coding region affecting up to 40% of patients. Intriguingly, both mutations are activating mutations leading in the case of CXCR4 to an indelible activation and perpetual signaling of the chemokine receptor. These data have shed light on the essential role of CXCR4 in this disease and have paved the way to use these findings for predicting treatment response to the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib and novel therapeutic approaches in WM, which might be transferable to other related CXCR4 positive diseases.

New reagents or biologicals for the treatment of AML are urgently needed, and exosomes have been identified as candidate biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exosomes from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on AML cells as well as the underlying microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mechanisms. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated using a precipitation method, followed by validation using marker protein expression and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by deep RNA sequencing and confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Cell proliferation was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium inner salt method, and cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Functional gene expression was analyzed by qPCR and Western blotting (WB). Significant differences were determined using Student's t test or analysis of variance. RESULTS: BMSCs-derived exosomes effectively suppressed cell proliferation (both P < 0.0001 at 10 and 20 mug/mL) and cell cycle progression (P < 0.01 at G0-G1 stage), and also significantly enhanced cell apoptosis (P < 0.001) in KG-1a cells. There were 1167 differentially expressed miRNAs obtained from BMSCs-derived exosomes compared with KG-1a cell-derived exosomes (P < 0.05). Knockdown of hsa-miR-124-5p in BMSCs abrogated the effects of BMSCs-derived exosomes in regulating KG-1a such as the change in cell proliferation (both P < 0.0001 vs. normal KG-1a cell [NC] at 48 and 72 h). KG-1a cells treated with BMSCs-derived exosomes suppressed expression of structural maintenance of chromosomes 4 (P < 0.001 vs. NC by qPCR and P < 0.0001 vs. NC by WB), which is associated with the progression of various cancers. This BMSCs-derived exosomes effect was significantly reversed with knockdown of hsa-miR-124-5p (P < 0.0001 vs. NC by WB). CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs-derived exosomes suppress cell proliferation and cycle progression and promote cell apoptosis in KG-1a cells, likely acting through hsa-miR-124-5p.

Yet, research into factors that may underlie inconsistent findings regarding the variable impact of parental responses is lacking. The current study investigated the moderating role of parental distress in understanding the impact of parental pain-attending (eg, reassuring the child) and non-pain-attending (eg, distracting the child with humor) responses on child pain behavior (eg, crying). METHODS: Children (18 y and younger) with leukemia, undergoing a lumbar puncture (LP) and/or bone marrow aspiration procedure, and one of their parents, were recruited from the Pediatric Ghent University Hospital. Parent-child interactions were videotaped after the procedure allowing coding of parental responses and child pain behavior. Parents self-reported on experienced personal distress. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 42 children (24 boys, 18 girls) with leukemia and one of their parents. Children were 0.6 to 15 (7.08+/-4.39) years old. Findings indicated a positive association between parental pain-attending and child pain behavior, but only when parents reported high levels of distress (beta=0.56, P=0.001). No association was observed for parents reporting low levels of distress (beta=-0.09, ns). Parental non-pain-attending responses contributed to lower child pain behavior (beta=-0.24, P=0.045), independently of parental distress (beta=-0.07, ns). DISCUSSION: The current findings point to the moderating role of parental distress in understanding the impact of parental responses on child pain behavior and highlight the importance of interventions targeting parental emotion regulation to promote optimal child pain outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The drug has a favorable tolerability and safety profile but the occurrence of specific side effects (e.g. atrial fibrillation, bleeding and hypertension). If atrial fibrillation is diagnosed, anticoagulant therapy may be required. Such patients receiving concomitant anticoagulation should be followed closely. DOAC is preferred over a VKA because of the lower risk of major bleeding events and because of the favorable stroke risk--benefit profile. Of all, Dabigatran offers the availability of an antidote and shows reduced potential for CYP3A4 interactions.

Previously, we established NF2 loss activates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling, leading to clinical trials for NF2 and MN. Recently our omics studies identified activated ephrin (EPH) receptor and Src family kinases upon NF2 loss. Here, we report increased expression of several ligands in NF2-null human arachnoidal cells (ACs) and the MN cell line Ben-Men-1, particularly neuregulin-1/heregulin (NRG1), and confirm increased NRG1 secretion and activation of V-ERB-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) receptor kinase. Conditioned-medium from NF2-null ACs or exogenous NRG1 stimulated ERBB3, EPHA2, and mTORC1/2 signaling, suggesting pathway crosstalk. NF2-null cells treated with an ERBB3-neutralizing antibody partially downregulated mTOR pathway activation but showed no effect on viability. mTORC1/2 inhibitor treatment decreased NRG1 expression and downregulated ERBB3 while re-activating pAkt T308, suggesting a mechanism independent of NRG1-ERBB3 but likely involving activation of another upstream receptor kinase. Transcriptomics after mTORC1/2 inhibition confirmed decreased ERBB3/ERBB4 while revealing increased expression of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R). Drug treatment co-targeting mTORC1/2 and IGF1R/insulin receptor attenuated pAkt T308 and showed synergistic effects on viability. Our findings indicate potential autocrine signaling where NF2 loss leads to secretion/activation of NRG1-ERBB3 signaling. mTORC1/2 inhibition downregulates NRG1-ERBB3, while upregulating pAkt T308 through an adaptive response involving IGF1R/insulin receptor and co-targeting these pathways may prove effective for treatment of NF2-deficient MN.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Inhibition of BTK has been proven to be an effective therapeutic approach for various hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell leukemia (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, a new series of imidazole group-substituted arylaminopyrimidines (IAAPs) were designed and synthesized as potent inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of BTK with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 13.10 to 42.40 nM. In particular, 11a and 11b exhibited stronger antiproliferative activity against AML and B lymphomas cell lines compared with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and showed low cytotoxicity against normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, analysis of the mechanism of action of these compounds revealed that 11a and 11b induced significant apoptosis in AML and B lymphoma cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G1/G0 or G2/M stage and blocked BTK autophosphorylation as well as the ensuing abrogation of pro-survival AKT and ERK signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that 11a and 11b might serve as valuable preclinical candidates for the treatment of AML and B-cell lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Throughout Australia and New Zealand massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is being adopted by diagnostic laboratories for the routine evaluation of patients with AML. This technology enables the surveying of many genes simultaneously, with many technical advantages over single gene testing approaches. However, there are many variations in wet and dry lab MPS procedures, which raises the prospect of discordant results between laboratories. This study compared the results obtained from MPS testing of ten diagnostic AML bone marrow aspirate samples sent to eight participating laboratories across Australasia. A reassuringly high concordance of 94% was observed with regard to variant detection and characterisation of pathogenicity. The level of discordance observed, although low, demonstrates the need for ongoing assessment of concordance between diagnostic testing laboratories through quality assurance programs.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

It is a solid mass formed by the primitive or immature myeloid cells extramedullary infiltration, which is commonly caused by acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It mainly involves bones, lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues of the head and neck. In general, the incidence is low and central nervous system (CNS) involvement is relatively rare. The clinical manifestations of the disease are varied and the treatment is intractable. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old male with intracranial granulocytic sarcoma who suffered a pressing pain on the left cheek. The patient had a hypophasis with left corneal reflex diminished. He had bilateral anisocoria, lower jaw and tongue tilted to the left upon opening the mouth and the left pharyngeal reflex was declined. The whole blood routine was normal except for eosinophils, head magnetic resonance imaging plain scan revealed a space-occupying lesion. Postoperative pathology suggested GS.

Currently, two CAR-T-cell products, Kymriah and Yescarta, are approved for leukemia patients, and various anti-CD19 CAR T cells are undergoing clinical trial. Most of these anti-CD19 CAR T cells use FMC63 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) for binding CD19 expressed on the cancer cell surface. In this study, we screened several known CD19 scFvs for developing anti-CD19 CAR T cells. We used the KHYG-1 NK/T-cell line for screening of CD19 scFvs because it has advantages in terms of cell culture and gene transduction compared to primary T cells. Using our CAR construct backbone, we made anti-CD19 CAR constructs which each had CD19 scFvs including FMC63, B43, 25C1, BLY3, 4G7, HD37, HB12a, and HB12b, then made each anti-CD19 CAR KHYG-1 cells. Interestingly, only FMC63 CAR KHYG-1 and 4G7 CAR KHYG-1 efficiently lysed CD19-positive cell lines. In addition, in Jurkat cell line, only these two CAR Jurkat cell lines secreted IL-2 when co-cultured with CD19-positive cell line, NALM-6. Based on these results, we made FMC63 CAR T cells and 4G7 CAR T cells from PBMC. In in vitro lysis assay, 4G7 CAR T cells lysed CD19-positive cell line as well as FMC63 CAR T cells. In in vivo assay with NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice, 4G7 CAR T cells eradicated NALM-6 as potently as FMC63 CAR T cells. Therefore, we anticipate that 4G7 CAR T cells will show as good a result as FMC63 CAR T cells for B-cell leukemia patients.",,"['Kang, Chung Hyo', 'Kim, Yeongrin', 'Lee, Heung Kyoung', 'Lee, So Myoung', 'Jeong, Hye Gwang', 'Choi, Sang Un', 'Park, Chi Hoon']","['Kang CH', 'Kim Y', 'Lee HK', 'Lee SM', 'Jeong HG', 'Choi SU', 'Park CH']","['Therapeutics & Biotechnology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, PO Box 107, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Korea.', 'Therapeutics & Biotechnology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, PO Box 107, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Korea University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Therapeutics & Biotechnology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, PO Box 107, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'Therapeutics & Biotechnology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, PO Box 107, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Korea.', 'Therapeutics & Biotechnology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, PO Box 107, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'Therapeutics & Biotechnology Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, PO Box 107, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Korea University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7730610,['NOTNLM'],"['4G7', 'CD19', 'FMC63', 'chimeric-antigen receptor', 'leukemia', 'scFv']",,2020/12/05 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/12/04 01:01'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/04 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Dec 1;21(23). pii: ijms21239163. doi: 10.3390/ijms21239163.,20210309,E9163 [pii] 10.3390/ijms21239163 [doi],"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['ijms21239163 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21239163 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5625-4964', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8020-8914']",,"['BSK20-402/Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology', 'SI1931-40/Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we deeply studied KIR2D allele expression, HLA-C recognition and functional effect on NK cells in 108 blood donors in combining high-resolution KIR allele typing and multicolor flow cytometry. The KIR2DL1*003 allotype is associated with centromeric (cen) AA motif and confers the highest NK cell frequency, expression level and strength of KIR/HLA-C interactions compared to the KIR2DL1*002 and KIR2DL1*004 allotypes respectively associated with cenAB and BB motifs. KIR2DL2*001 and *003 allotypes negatively affect the frequency of KIR2DL1(+) and KIR2DL3(+) NK cells. Altogether, our data suggest that cenAA individuals display more efficient KIR2DL alleles (L1*003 and L3*001) to mount a consistent frequency of KIR2DL(+) NK cells and to confer an effective NK cell responsiveness. The transposition of our in vitro observations in the T-replete haplo-identical HSCT context led us to observe that cenAA HSC grafts limit significantly the incidence of relapse in patients with myeloid diseases after T-replete haplo-identical HSCT.

METHODS: Immunophenotypic data from 268 diagnostic AML samples obtained in 2009-2018 were analyzed retrospectively for the antigens CD34, CD117, CD123, and CLEC12A. Correlation between immunophenotypes and mutations was analyzed by Fischer's exact test. Clinical applicability of the markers for predicting mutational status was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics analyses, where an area under the curve (AUC) of at least 0.85 was accepted as clinically relevant. RESULTS: For a number of genes, the antigen expression differed significantly between mutated and wild-type gene expression. Despite low AUCs, CD123 and CLEC12A correlated with FLT3+NPM1- and FLT3+NPM1+. Three subsets met the AUC requirements (CD34+, CD34+CD117+, and CD34-CD117+) for predicting FLT3-NPM1+ or FLT3+NPM1+. CONCLUSION: The value of immunophenotypes as surrogate markers for mutational status in AML seems limited when employing CD123 and CLEC12A in combination with CD34 and CD117. Defining relevant cutoffs for given markers is challenging and hampered by variation between laboratories and patient groups.","['(c) 2020 S.

However, leukemic cells apply various immune evasion mechanisms to deviate host immune responses resulting tumor progression. One of the recently well-known immune escape mechanisms is over-expression of immune checkpoint receptors and their ligands. Introduction of blocking antibodies targeting co-inhibitory molecules achieved invaluable success in tumor targeted therapy. Moreover, several new co-inhibitory pathways are currently studying for their potential impacts on improving anti-tumor immune responses. Although immunotherapeutic strategies based on the blockade of immune checkpoint molecules have shown promising results in a number of hematological malignances, their effectiveness in AML patients showed less remarkable success.

The potential of the natural anthraquinone parietin (PTN) in PDT is still relatively unexploited. In the present work, PTN isolated from the lichen Teoloschistes nodulifer (Nyl.) Hillman (Telochistaceae) was evaluated as a potential photosensitiser on tumour cells employing UVA-Vis and blue light. Blue light of 2 J/cm(2) induced 50% death of K562 leukaemic cells treated 1 h with 30 muM PTN (Protocol a). Higher light doses (8 J/cm(2)) were needed to achieve the same percentage of cell death employing lower PTN concentrations (3 muM) and higher exposure times (24 h) (Protocol b). Cell cycle analysis after both protocols of PTN-PDT revealed a high percentage of sub-G1 cells. PTN was found to be taken up by K562 cells mainly by passive diffusion. Other tumour cells such as ovary cancer IGROV-1 and LM2 mammary carcinoma, as well as the normal keratinocytes HaCaT, were also photosensitised with PTN-PDT. We conclude that PTN is a promising photosensitiser for PDT of superficial malignancies and purging of leukaemic cells, when illuminated with blue light. Thus, this light wavelength is proposed to replace the Vis-UVA lamps generally employed for the photosensitisation of anthraquinones.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We retrospectively studied the characteristics and outcomes of 66 (18 pediatric and 48 adult) patients with CNS leukemia with ALL (n = 41) or AML (n = 25). The median age of patients at diagnosis of CNS leukemia was 30 (range, 1-69) years. Nearly two-third patients had CNS involvement at the initial diagnosis of leukemia. Complete remission of CNS leukemia was attained in 58 (88%) patients, and probability of overall survival at 36 months after the diagnosis of CNS leukemia was 43% for the entire cohort. We identified that achieving remission of systemic leukemia and having CNS leukemia diagnosed and treated before allogeneic transplantation were the factors associated with CNS leukemia remission. Prognostic factors associated with better overall survival in patients with CNS leukemia included pediatric age, diagnosis of CNS leukemia before receiving allogenic transplantation, achieving clearance of systemic or CNS leukemia, receiving no cranial radiation in conjunction with intrathecal chemotherapy (IT), and receiving IT consolidation after achieving remission of CNS leukemia. Our findings show that patients with CNS leukemia are at considerable risk of mortality. Awareness of modifiable prognostic factors such as avoidance of cranial radiation whenever possible and use of IT consolidation can result in improved outcomes in subset of patients with CNS leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2020 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Refractory or relapsed disease because of chemotherapy resistance is a major issue. microRNAs (miRNAs) were incriminated in resistance. This study aimed to identify miRNAs involved in chemoresistance in AML patients and to define their target genes. We focused on cytogenetically normal AML patients with wild-type NPM1 without FLT3-ITD as the treatment of this subset of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics is not well established. We analysed baseline AML samples by small RNA sequencing and compared the profile of chemoresistant to chemosensitive AML patients. Among the miRNAs significantly overexpressed in chemoresistant patients, we revealed miR-15a-5p and miR-21-5p as miRNAs with a major role in chemoresistance in AML. We showed that miR-15a-5p and miR-21-5p overexpression decreased apoptosis induced by cytarabine and/or daunorubicin. PDCD4, ARL2 and BTG2 genes were found to be targeted by miR-15a-5p, as well as PDCD4 and BTG2 by miR-21-5p. Inhibition experiments of the three target genes reproduced the functional effect of both miRNAs on chemosensitivity. Our study demonstrates that miR-15a-5p and miR-21-5p are overexpressed in a subgroup of chemoresistant AML patients. Both miRNAs induce chemoresistance by targeting three pro-apoptotic genes PDCD4, ARL2 and BTG2.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The authors evaluated a combination of the high-affinity CXCR4 antagonist BL-8040 with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) chemotherapy in a phase 2a study of patients with relapsed and refractory AML. METHODS: Forty-two patients received treatment with BL-8040 monotherapy for 2 days followed by a combination of BL-8040 with HiDAC for 5 days. Six escalating BL-8040 dose levels were investigated (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg), and 1.5 mg/kg was selected as the dose for the expansion phase (n = 23). RESULTS: BL-8040 in combination with HiDAC was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels. Clinical response was observed with BL-8040 doses >/=1.0 mg/kg. The composite response rate (complete remissions plus complete remissions with incomplete hematologic recovery of platelets or neutrophils) was 29% (12 of 42) in all patients and 39% (9 of 23) in the 1.5-mg/kg phase. The median overall survival was 8.4 months for all patients, 10.8 months in the 1.5-mg/kg phase, and 21.8 months for responding patients in the 1.5-mg/kg cohort.

Targeted adoptive T-cell therapies have achieved impressive clinical outcomes in some B-cell leukemias and lymphomas but not in AML. Double-negative T cells (DNTs) effectively kill blast cells from the majority of AML patients and are now being tested in clinical trials. However, AML blasts obtained from approximately 30% of patients show resistance to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity; the markers or mechanisms underlying this resistance have not been elucidated. Here, we used a targeted clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) screen to identify genes that cause susceptibility of AML cells to DNT therapy. Inactivation of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) deubiquitinating complex components sensitized AML cells to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, CD64 inactivation resulted in resistance to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity. Importantly, the level of CD64 expression correlated strongly with the sensitivity of AML cells to DNT treatment. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of CD64 overcame AML resistance to DNTs in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our data demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 screens to uncover mechanisms underlying the sensitivity to DNT therapy and suggest CD64 as a predictive marker for response in AML patients.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Soares, Fraser', 'Chen, Branson', 'Lee, Jong Bok', 'Ahmed, Musaddeque', 'Ly, Dalam', 'Tin, Enoch', 'Kang, Hyeonjeong', 'Zeng, Yong', 'Akhtar, Nayeema', 'Minden, Mark D', 'He, Housheng Hansen', 'Zhang, Li']","['Soares F', 'Chen B', 'Lee JB', 'Ahmed M', 'Ly D', 'Tin E', 'Kang H', 'Zeng Y', 'Akhtar N', 'Minden MD', 'He HH', 'Zhang L']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Immunology, and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Immunology, and.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Immunology, and.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology.', 'Department of Immunology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2020/12/04 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/12/03 17:15'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/03 17:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Apr 22;137(16):2171-2181. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004108.,20210928,10.1182/blood.2019004108 [doi],"['0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation']","['S0006-4971(21)00864-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004108 [doi]']",,,,['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infusion of unselected donor lymphocytes (DLIs) enhances the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, because the infused lymphocytes are not selected for leukemia specificity, the GVL effect is often accompanied by life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), related to the concurrent transfer of alloreactive lymphocytes. Thus, to minimize GVHD and maximize GVL, we selectively activated and expanded stem cell donor-derived T cells reactive to multiple antigens expressed by AML/MDS cells (PRAME, WT1, Survivin, and NY-ESO-1). Products that demonstrated leukemia antigen specificity were generated from 29 HCT donors. In contrast to DLIs, leukemia-specific T cells (mLSTs) selectively recognized and killed leukemia antigen-pulsed cells, with no activity against recipient's normal cells in vitro. We administered escalating doses of mLSTs (0.5 to 10 x 107 cells per square meter) to 25 trial enrollees, 17 with high risk of relapse and 8 with relapsed disease. Infusions were well tolerated with no grade >2 acute or extensive chronic GVHD seen. We observed antileukemia effects in vivo that translated into not-yet-reached median leukemia-free and overall survival at 1.9 years of follow-up and objective responses in the active disease cohort (1 complete response and 1 partial response). In summary, mLSTs are safe and promising for the prevention and treatment of AML/MDS after HCT.

Although the efficacy of TKIs is beyond dispute, conception-related safety issues are still waiting to be explored, particularly in males. This systematic review aimed to summarize all available evidence on pregnancy outcomes of female spouses of male CML patients who fathered children after TKI treatment for CML. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in seven electronic databases for studies that reported on male CML patients who did or did not discontinue TKI treatment before conceiving, and the pregnancy outcomes of their female spouse are available. The search centered on the TKI era (from 2001 onward) without any other language or study design restrictions. RESULTS: Out of a total of 38 potentially eligible papers, 27 non-overlapping study cohorts were analyzed. All were descriptive studies (case or case series studies). Altogether, 428 pregnancies from 374 fathers conceived without treatment discontinuation, 400 of which (93.5%) ended up in a live birth. A total of ten offspring with a malformation (2.5%) were reported: six with imatinib (of 313 live births, 1.9%), two with nilotinib (of 26 live births, 7.7%), one with dasatinib (of 43 live births, 2.3%), and none with bosutinib (of 12 live births). Data on CML status were scarcely reported. Only nine pregnancies (from nine males) and no malformation were reported in males who discontinued TKI treatment before conception. CONCLUSION: Malformations affected, on average 2.5% of live births from fathers who did not discontinue TKI treatment before conception, which is comparable with the rate of malformations in the general population. Large-scale studies with representative samples are awaited to confirm our results.",,"['Szakacs, Zsolt', 'Hegyi, Peter Jeno', 'Farkas, Nelli', 'Hegyi, Peter', 'Balasko, Marta', 'Eros, Adrienn', 'Szujo, Szabina', 'Pammer, Judit', 'Mosdosi, Bernadett', 'Simon, Maria', 'Nagy, Arnold', 'Fur, Gabriella', 'Hussain, Alizadeh']","['Szakacs Z', 'Hegyi PJ', 'Farkas N', 'Hegyi P', 'Balasko M', 'Eros A', 'Szujo S', 'Pammer J', 'Mosdosi B', 'Simon M', 'Nagy A', 'Fur G', 'Hussain A']","['Institute for Translational Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Szentagothai Research Centre, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Institute for Translational Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Institute of Bioanalysis, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Institute for Translational Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Institute for Translational Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Institute for Translational Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Szentagothai Research Centre, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Division of Hematology, First Department of Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Division of Hematology, First Department of Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Institute of Pathophysiology, University of Szeged, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Division of Hematology, First Department of Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20201203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC7714354,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/12/04 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/12/03 17:15'],"['2019/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/03 17:15 [entrez]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Dec 3;15(12):e0243045. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0243045. eCollection 2020.,20210211,10.1371/journal.pone.0243045 [doi],"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/etiology', 'Aniline Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Nitriles/therapeutic use', 'Paternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/therapeutic use']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0243045 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-31926 [pii]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7035-941X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6443-0259', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4358-9834', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3749-6444']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To compare costs, use of resources, and clinical outcomes between an early palliative home care program and standard hospital care for active-advanced or terminal phase patients. Patients and Methods: In this real-life, nonrandomized comparative study, the allocation of advanced/terminal phase patients to either home or hospital was based on pragmatic considerations. Analysis focused on resources use, events requiring blood unit transfusions or parenteral therapy, patient-reported symptom burden, mean weekly cost of care (MWC), cost-minimization difference, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: Of 119 patients, 59 patients cared at home were more debilitated and had a shorter survival than the 60 in hospital group (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, symptom burden was similar in both groups. At home the mean weekly number of transfusions (1.45) was lower than that at hospital (2.77). Higher rate of infections occurred at hospital (54%) versus home (21%; <0.001). MWC for hospitalization was significantly higher in a 3:1 ratio versus home care. Compared with hospital, domiciliary assistance produced a weekly saving of euro 2314.9 for the health provider, with a charge of euro 85.9 for the family, and was cost-effective by an ICER of euro -7013.9 of prevented days of care for avoided infections. Conclusions: Current findings suggest that costs of early palliative home care for patients with hematologic malignancies are lower than standard hospital care costs.

Previous investigations highlighted double-strand breaks arising from maternal exposure to xenobiotics during pregnancy as a risk factor for EAL and KMT2A-r. In this case-control study, we investigated the relationship between EAL and genetic variants of the nonhomologous end-joining (XRCC6 rs5751129, XRCC4 rs6869366 and rs28360071), since they might affect DNA repair capacity, leading to KMT2A-r and leukemogenesis. Samples from 577 individuals (acute lymphoblastic leukemia-ALL, n=164; acute myeloid leukemia-AML, n=113; controls, n=300) were genotyped. No significant association was found for rs5751129 and rs6869366, whereas rs28360071 was associated with an increased risk for ALL with KMT2A-r (IIxID: OR - Odds ratio 2.23, CI 1.17-4.25, p=0.014). Bone marrow samples from ALL patients showed a higher expression of XRCC4 compared to AML patients (p=0.025). Human Splicing Finder 3.1 predicted that the deleted allele of rs28360071 is potentially associated with the activation of a 5' cryptic splice site in intron 3 of XRCC4. The sequencing of cDNA did not show any differences on the splicing process for the rs28360071 genotypes.

METHODS: We enrolled 1021 pregnant women with PE and 1594 normotensive pregnant women to analyze genotyping of MOV10 rs2932538. Clinical data and related test results of all subjects were collected and analyzed. For volunteers providing placentas, real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were applied to assess the expression level of MOV10. RESULTS: There was significant statistical difference between preeclamptic patients and healthy subjects in genotype distributions and alleles. The frequencies of genotypes TT+CT were significantly associated with the increased risk of preeclampsia. Besides, T alleles were found to be related to a higher risk of PE. Significant statistical difference was also observed on distributions of genotype in PE without/with severe features group compared or early onset/late onset versus controls. The placental expression of MOV10 was lower in preeclamptic women, however, no relationship was found between MOV10 expression level and MOV10 rs2932538 genotypes. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MOV10 rs2932538 polymorphism may be associated with PE susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.

The diagnosis is confirmed by the finding of pancreatic duct obstruction on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with evidence of infection, such as a positive pancreatic juice culture or drainage of purulent pancreatic juice. Patients and methods We studied five patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and one with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), who suffered from AOSPD. Results Of the 281 PDAC and 39 CML patients who we treated in the past 2 years in our hospital, five with PDAC (1.8 %) and one with CML (2.6 %) experienced AOSPD. Each patient had fever, abdominal pain, and increased blood C-reactive protein. Pancreatography found that each patient had a MPD stricture and an upstream dilatation. Four had a disruption of the MPD in the upper stream of the stricture. Nasopancreatic drainage was successfully performed in all patients. Pancreatic juice culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter agerogenes, or Enterococcus cloacae in four patients. Conclusion AOSPD should be considered in pancreatic malignancy with fever and abdominal pain. Prompt diagnosis of AOSPD could avoid shortening of survival of patients with an already poor prognosis by infection.","['The Author(s).

CASE SUMMARY: In this report, the patient did not receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment despite a two-year history of lymph node enlargement. Hereafter, she was admitted for B symptoms and was diagnosed as ALK-ALCL by lymph node biopsy. Then, the disease progressed to leukemia without any treatment after 2 mo. The proportion of lymphoma cells in bone marrow was as high as 96%, and the proportion of peripheral blood was 84%. She also had clinical manifestations similar to acute leukemia. After completion of chemotherapy, she developed granulocytopenia and fever and died from septicemia.

However, there are no guidelines for adjusting ATO dosage in patients with severe renal failure or on dialysis. Herein, we report the successful treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in a patient on hemodialysis with ATO single agent and review the cases in literature. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old woman who has been on hemodialysis to chronic glomerulone-phritis for 15 years visited our hospital for pancytopenia. She had been seen for pancytopenia 3 years ago and had been diagnosed with APL. She also received chemotherapy for APL but unfortunately was lost to follow-up after her second consolidation chemotherapy. She was noted to have pancytopenia by her nephrologist during hemodialysis 1 mo ago. Bone marrow biopsy and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests revealed a diagnosis of relapsed APL. Treatment for relapsed APL with ATO single agent was started and she achieved molecular remission after administering 24 doses of ATO. Thus far, four consolidation therapies have been performed with the ATO single agent, and, to date, the molecular remission has been maintained as negative promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusion gene as confirmed by RT-PCR testing for two years.

This study investigated clinical features and outcomes of posttransplant relapse of AML based on data for 1265 patients with AML suffering relapse after allogeneic HCT conducted during complete remission (CR). Relapse occurred at a median of 6.1 months. The incidence rate of relapse peaked at 29.0 per 100 patient-years during the first 3-6 months period post transplant, after which the rate declined over time, and after 3 years remained consistently at less than 1 per 100 patient-years. The probability of overall survival (OS) after posttransplant relapse was 19% at 2 years, with 68% of deaths being attributed to leukemia. The interval from transplantation to relapse was identified as the strongest indicator for OS. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and second allogeneic HCT (HCT2) were administered to 152 (12%) and 481 (38%) patients, respectively. Landmark analyses showed some signs of survival benefit when these procedures were performed during CR, but no benefit was gained when performed during non-CR.

The incidence of the following hematologic cancers was determined based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision: Multiple Myeloma (MM), Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), Lymphoid Leukemia (LL), and Myeloid Leukemia (ML). During an average of 8.3 years of follow-up (79,179,225 person-years), 15,864 incident hematologic malignancies were identified. Compared to those in the highest HDL-C quartile, subjects in the lowest HDL-C quartile had the highest risk of all hematologic cancers combined (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.31, 1.25-1.37) and of each respective type of blood cancer, as follows: MM (HR 1.61, 95% CI, 1.46-1.76), HL (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.70), NHL (HR 1.12, 95%CI 1.04-1.21), LL (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.16-1.61), and ML (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.22-1.45).

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development of physiology and pathology. Many reports have shown that lncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) is a carcinogen and plays an important role in many tumors, but little is known about its role in AML. The aim of this study was to explore the potential mechanism and role of HOXA-AS2 in AML. HOXA-AS2 was upregulated in AML cell lines and tissues, and the overexpression of HOXA-AS2 is negatively correlated with the survival of patients. Silencing HOXA-AS2 can inhibit the proliferation and induce differentiation of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpressing HOXA-AS2 showed the opposite result. Moreover, more in-depth mechanism studies showed that carcinogenicity of HOXA-AS2 exerted mainly through binding with the epigenetic inhibitor Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and then inhibiting the expression of Large Tumor Suppressor 2 (LATS2). Taken together, our findings highlight the important role of HOXA-AS2 in AML, suggesting that HOXA-AS2 may be an effective therapeutic target for patients with AML.",,"['Feng, Yubin', 'Hu, Shuang', 'Li, Lanlan', 'Peng, Xiaoqing', 'Chen, Feihu']","['Feng Y', 'Hu S', 'Li L', 'Peng X', 'Chen F']","['Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China. pengxiaoqing@ahmu.edu.cn.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China. pengxiaoqing@ahmu.edu.cn.', 'Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China. chenfeihu@ahmu.edu.cn.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China. chenfeihu@ahmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201202,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC7710717,,,,2020/12/04 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/12/03 05:41'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Dec 2;11(12):1025. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-03193-3.,20210408,10.1038/s41419-020-03193-3 [doi],"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (LATS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']","['10.1038/s41419-020-03193-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-03193-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GM-CSF is a regulator of granulocyte and macrophage lineage differentiation and a key player in the pathogenesis of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that Fli-1 regulates the expression of GM-CSF in both T cells and endothelial cells. The expression of GM-CSF was significantly reduced in T cells and endothelial cells when Fli-1 was reduced. We found that Fli-1 binds directly to the GM-CSF promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Transient transfection assays indicated that Fli-1 drives transcription from the GM-CSF promoter in a dose-dependent manner, and mutation of the Fli-1 DNA binding domain resulted in a significant loss of transcriptional activation. Mutation of a known phosphorylation site within the Fli-1 protein led to a significant increase in GM-CSF promoter activation. Thus, direct binding to the promoter and phosphorylation are two important mechanisms behind Fli-1-driven activation of the GM-CSF promoter. In addition, Fli-1 regulates GM-CSF expression in an additive manner with another transcription factor Sp1. Finally, we demonstrated that a low dose of a chemotherapeutic drug, camptothecin, inhibited expression of Fli-1 and reduced GM-CSF production in human T cells. These results demonstrate novel mechanisms for regulating the expression of GM-CSF and suggest that Fli-1 is a critical druggable regulator of inflammation and immunity.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Wang, Xuan', 'Lennard Richard, Mara', 'Li, Pengfei', 'Henry, Brittany', 'Schutt, Steven', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong', 'Fan, Hongkuan', 'Zhang, Weiru', 'Gilkeson, Gary', 'Zhang, Xian K']","['Wang X', 'Lennard Richard M', 'Li P', 'Henry B', 'Schutt S', 'Yu XZ', 'Fan H', 'Zhang W', 'Gilkeson G', 'Zhang XK']","['Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425; and.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425; and.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425.', 'Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425; zhangjo@musc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201202,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC7942804,,,,2020/12/04 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/12/03 05:40'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/03 05:40 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2021 Jan 1;206(1):59-66. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2000664.

At doses of 9mg/m(2), its benefit was limited by hepatotoxicity and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Fractionated doses improved toxicity without compromising efficacy. We evaluated the efficacy and the toxicity of low doses of GO. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with AML received 3mg/m(2) of GO as a part of the induction or reinduction therapy. RESULTS: Fourteen patients diagnosed with de novo AML and 10 patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML received GO as a part of the induction or reinduction therapy. Three and no cases of hepatotoxicity were observed, respectively. Thirteen patients received a subsequent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after GO therapy. Hepatotoxicity was observed in 2 patients and no SOS was observed in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of low dose GO is feasible and does not have impact on subsequent HSCT outcome. Although some degree of hepatotoxicity was observed, there were no cases of SOS, either before or after HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Besides its analgesic effects on neuron cells, the effects of oxycodone on other cell types are yet to be elucidated. We previously demonstrated that oxycodone displayed both pro- and anti-cancer effects on bulk cancer cells. This work further investigated the effects of oxycodone on normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells. Using hematopoietic CD34(+) cells isolated from normal bone marrow (NBM) or patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we showed that oxycodone activates hematopoietic cells regardless of cell development stage and malignant status. Oxycodone dose-dependently increases colony formation and self-renewal capacity of NBM and AML stem/progenitor cells, and promotes proliferation of AML bulk cells. NBM stem/progenitor cells are more sensitive to oxycodone than AML counterparts. In addition, oxycodone alleviates chemotherapy drug-induced toxicity in AML stem/progenitor cells. Mechanism studies demonstrate that oxycodone acts on hematopoietic cells in an opioid-receptor-independent manner. Oxycodone did not affect epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling neither but stimulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Rescue studies via depleting beta-catenin using genetic and pharmacological approaches confirmed that beta-catenin was required for the activation of hematopoietic cells induced by oxycodone. Our work demonstrates 1) the protective role of oxycodone in malignant hematopoietic cells from chemotherapy; 2) stimulatory effects of oxycodone in normal hematopoietic stem cells; and 3) ability of oxycodone in Wnt signaling activation.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with MPNs suffer from substantial symptom burden and curtailed longevity due to thrombohemorrhagic complications or progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia. Therefore, the management strategies focus on thrombosis risk mitigation in PV/ET, alleviation of symptom burden and improvement in cytopenias and red blood cell transfusion requirements, and disease course alteration in PMF. The United States Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA) approval of two JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, fedratinib) has transformed the therapeutic landscape of MPNs in assuaging the need for frequent therapeutic phlebotomy (PV) and reduction in spleen and symptom burden (PV and PMF). Despite improving biological understanding of these complex clonal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell neoplasms, none of the currently available therapies appear to modify the proclivity of the disease per se, thereby remaining an urgent unmet clinical need and an ongoing area of intense clinical investigation.

Due to the high costs and time complexity of traditional bio-experiments, in recent years, more and more computational methods have been proposed by researchers to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations. However, there exist all kinds of limitations in these state-of-the-art prediction methods as well. RESULTS: In this manuscript, a novel computational model named FVTLDA is proposed to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations. In FVTLDA, its major novelty lies in the integration of direct and indirect features related to lncRNA-disease associations such as the feature vectors of lncRNA-disease pairs and their corresponding association probability fractions, which guarantees that FVTLDA can be utilized to predict diseases without known related-lncRNAs and lncRNAs without known related-diseases. Moreover, FVTLDA neither relies solely on known lncRNA-disease nor requires any negative samples, which guarantee that it can infer potential lncRNA-disease associations more equitably and effectively than traditional state-of-the-art prediction methods. Additionally, to avoid the limitations of single model prediction techniques, we combine FVTLDA with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for data analysis respectively. Simulation experiment results show that FVTLDA with MLR can achieve reliable AUCs of 0.8909, 0.8936 and 0.8970 in 5-Fold Cross Validation (fivefold CV), 10-Fold Cross Validation (tenfold CV) and Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV), separately, while FVTLDA with ANN can achieve reliable AUCs of 0.8766, 0.8830 and 0.8807 in fivefold CV, tenfold CV, and LOOCV respectively. Furthermore, in case studies of gastric cancer, leukemia and lung cancer, experiment results show that there are 8, 8 and 8 out of top 10 candidate lncRNAs predicted by FVTLDA with MLR, and 8, 7 and 8 out of top 10 candidate lncRNAs predicted by FVTLDA with ANN, having been verified by recent literature. Comparing with the representative prediction model of KATZLDA, comparison results illustrate that FVTLDA with MLR and FVTLDA with ANN can achieve the average case study contrast scores of 0.8429 and 0.8515 respectively, which are both notably higher than the average case study contrast score of 0.6375 achieved by KATZLDA. CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that FVTLDA has good prediction performance, which is a good supplement to future bioinformatics research.",,"['Xiao, Yubin', 'Xiao, Zheng', 'Feng, Xiang', 'Chen, Zhiping', 'Kuang, Linai', 'Wang, Lei']","['Xiao Y', 'Xiao Z', 'Feng X', 'Chen Z', 'Kuang L', 'Wang L']","[""College of Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, 410001, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, 411105, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Tumor Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Cancer Research Institute, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, 410001, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, 410001, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, 411105, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, 410001, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, 411105, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201202,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC7709313,['NOTNLM'],"['Artificial neural network', 'Features', 'LncRNA-disease association prediction', 'Multiple linear regression', 'Random walk']",,2020/12/04 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/12/03 05:26'],"['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/03 05:26 [entrez]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 Dec 2;21(1):555. doi: 10.1186/s12859-020-03906-7.,20201216,10.1186/s12859-020-03906-7 [doi],"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', '*Computer Simulation', 'Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']","['10.1186/s12859-020-03906-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-020-03906-7 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5065-8447'],,"['61873221/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018JJ4058/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province', '2019JJ70010/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we conducted a multicenter phase II trial of HSCT using low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, thymoglobulin). We recruited patients aged 16-65 years with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma who planned to receive HSCT from a related donor with HLA 1-antigen mismatch in the GVH direction at the HLA-A, -B, or -DR locus. Pretransplantation ATG was administered with standard GVHD prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and methotrexate. Thirty-eight patients were eligible for the analysis. The 1-year GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 47%. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 57%. Age of less than 50 years was associated with better OS. OS in patients with high/very high refined disease risk indexes (rDRIs) was comparable to that in those with low/intermediate rDRIs. The 100-day cumulative incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD were 45% and 18%, respectively.

Feature selection plays an important role in dealing with high-dimensional data for improvement of predictive accuracy, as well as better interpretation of the data. Frequently used evaluation functions for feature selection include resampling methods such as cross-validation, which show an advantage in predictive accuracy. However, these conventional methods are not only computationally expensive, but also tend to be over-optimistic. We propose a novel cross-entropy which is based on beta distribution for feature selection. In beta distribution-based cross-entropy (BetaDCE) for feature selection, the probability density is estimated by beta distribution and the cross-entropy is computed by the expected value of beta distribution, so that the generalization ability can be estimated more precisely than conventional methods where the probability density is learnt from data. Analysis of the generalization ability of BetaDCE revealed that it was a trade-off between bias and variance. The robustness of BetaDCE was demonstrated by experiments on three types of data. In the exclusive or-like (XOR-like) dataset, the false discovery rate of BetaDCE was significantly smaller than that of other methods. For the leukemia dataset, the area under the curve (AUC) of BetaDCE on the test set was 0.93 with only four selected features, which indicated that BetaDCE not only detected the irrelevant and redundant features precisely, but also more accurately predicted the class labels with a smaller number of features than the original method, whose AUC was 0.83 with 50 features. In the metabonomic dataset, the overall AUC of prediction with features selected by BetaDCE was significantly larger than that by the original reported method. Therefore, BetaDCE can be used as a general and efficient framework for feature selection.",,"['Dai, Weixing', 'Guo, Dianjing']","['Dai W', 'Guo D']","['School of Life Science and State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, G94, Science Center South Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin 999077, Hong Kong, China.', 'School of Life Science and State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, G94, Science Center South Block, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin 999077, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190807,Switzerland,Entropy (Basel),"Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)",101243874,PMC7515297,['NOTNLM'],"['beta distribution', 'cross-entropy', 'data mining', 'feature selection', 'machine learning']",,2019/08/07 00:00,2019/08/07 00:01,['2020/12/03 01:09'],"['2019/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/03 01:09 [entrez]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/07 00:01 [medline]']",epublish,Entropy (Basel). 2019 Aug 7;21(8). pii: e21080769. doi: 10.3390/e21080769.,,E769 [pii] 10.3390/e21080769 [doi],,,,"['e21080769 [pii]', '10.3390/e21080769 [doi]']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5395-8568'],,['8300052/Innovation Technology Fund of Innovation Technology Commission'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncontrolled infections can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, known as a cytokine storm. As cytokines also play necessary and positive roles in fighting infections, it is important to identify nontoxic and anti-inflammatory natural products that can modulate cytokine production caused by infections. Rubi Fructus, the unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus Miquel, are known to possess antioxidative properties. In this study, the effect of the water extract of Rubi Fructus (RF) on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophages was investigated using biochemical and cell biology techniques. Our data indicated that RF inhibits p38 phosphorylation, intracellular calcium release, and the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic activating factor (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-2, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in LPS-treated macrophages. In addition, we observed decreasing mRNA expression of Chop, Camk2a, Stat1, Stat3, Jak2, Fas, c-Jun, c-Fos, Nos2, and Ptgs2 without cytotoxic effects. We concluded that RF demonstrated immunoregulatory activity on LPS-stimulated macrophages via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced calcium/CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) pathway and the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway.",,"['Kim, Do-Hoon', 'Lee, Ji-Young', 'Kim, Young-Jin', 'Kim, Hyun-Ju', 'Park, Wansu']","['Kim DH', 'Lee JY', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Park W']","['Department of Medical Classics and History, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201122,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,PMC7700618,['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'Rubi Fructus', 'Rubus coreanus', 'STAT', 'calcium', 'chop', 'cytokine', 'lipopolysaccharide', 'macrophage', 'nitric oxide']",,2020/12/04 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/12/03 01:06'],"['2020/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/03 01:06 [entrez]', '2020/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Nov 22;12(11). pii: nu12113577. doi: 10.3390/nu12113577.,20210408,E3577 [pii] 10.3390/nu12113577 [doi],"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*physiology', 'Fruit/chemistry', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Rubus/*chemistry', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*metabolism', 'Water']","['nu12113577 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12113577 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8932-3348', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8752-4365']",,"['2017R1A2B4004933/Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unknown how HMA with venetoclax compare to intensive chemotherapy (IC) in patients who are ""fit"" or ""unfit"" for IC. We compared outcomes of older patients with newly diagnosed AML receiving 10-day decitabine with venetoclax (DEC10-VEN) vs IC. DEC10-VEN consisted of daily venetoclax with decitabine 20 mg/m(2) for 10 days for induction and decitabine for 5 days as consolidation. The IC cohort received regimens containing cytarabine >/=1 g/m(2) /d. A validated treatment-related mortality score (TRMS) was used to classify patients at high-risk or low-risk for TRM with IC. Propensity scores were used to match patients to minimize bias. Median age of the DEC10-VEN cohort (n = 85) was 72 years (range 63-89) and 28% patients were at high-risk of TRM with IC. The comparator IC group (n = 85) matched closely in terms of baseline characteristics. DEC10-VEN was associated with significantly higher CR/CRi compared to IC (81% vs 52%, P < .001), and lower rate of relapse (34% vs 56%, P = .01), 30-day mortality (1% vs 24%, P < .01), and longer overall survival (OS; 12.4 vs 4.5 months, HR = 0.48, 95%CI 0.29-0.79, P < .01). In patients at both at high-risk and low-risk of TRM, DEC10-VEN showed significantly higher CR/CRi, lower 30-day mortality, and longer OS compared to IC. Patients at both high-risk and low-risk of TRM had comparable outcomes with DEC10-VEN.

The blood and bone marrow of patients typically consists of a mix of different clones and subclones along the path of clonal evolution that cannot be deconvoluted with most current approaches. Here, we review the application of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to the study of the clonal architecture and clonal evolution of these diseases, focusing on myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Reprogramming to pluripotency allows capture of the genomes of single somatic cells into stable iPSC lines. In addition, precise genome editing can introduce specific driver mutations, isolated, and in combinations, into normal iPSCs. Studies utilizing these approaches have elucidated the clonal composition and mutational order in patients with myeloid neoplasms. Importantly, they have also enabled functional interrogation of the cellular and molecular consequences of individual mutations and their combinations and allowed testing of the effects of drugs on distinct disease clones.

For the majority of patients, it is now possible to successfully treat this disease ""chemo-free"" without the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy as reflected in current clinical guidelines. The Sanz risk score developed by the GIMEMA and PETHEMA groups categorizes patients into three risk groups-low, intermediate, and high and correlates with relapse-free survival (RFS). Low- and intermediate-risk APL are now often considered together as 'standard-risk' defined by a white blood cell count (WBC) of less than 10 x 10(9)/L. High-risk APL has a WBC greater than 10 x 10(9)/L. In the UK our approach for patients with standard risk APL is to treat with ATRA and ATO without the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. This approach is based on results from two large randomized clinical trials. The GIMEMA APL0406 trial showed an overall survival advantage compared to anthracycline-based chemotherapy plus ATRA. The UK NCRI AML17 trial which used an attenuated dose of ATO demonstrated a significant reduction in relapse and improved relapse-free survival. In the UK, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence approved both ATO plus ATRA regimens for re-imbursement for standard risk Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL). We use the AML17 schedule in standard-risk patients upfront and also in patients with relapsed Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL) previously treated with chemotherapy or in those with molecular persistence. The treatment of high-risk Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL) remains an area of contention as ATO is not approved for this indication. These patients have a greater risk of complications during remission induction with ATO including differentiation syndrome. The optimal approach is to incorporate chemotherapy early into the treatment schedule with either Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) as in the high-risk arm of the NCRI AML17 trial and MD Anderson Cancer Centre studies or Idarubicin as in the Australian APML4 study.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Russell and Dillon.'],"['Russell, Nigel', 'Dillon, Richard']","['Russell N', 'Dillon R']","[""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom."", ""Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201111,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7688053,['NOTNLM'],"['NCRI AML17', 'acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)', 'arsenic trioxide', 'gemtuzumab ozagamicin', 'minimal residual disease']",,2020/12/03 06:00,2020/12/03 06:01,['2020/12/02 05:33'],"['2020/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/02 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/03 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 11;10:594129. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.594129. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.594129 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.594129 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With advances in childhood ALL treatment, the cure rate for childhood ALL has exceeded 80% in most countries. However, refractory/relapsed ALL remains a leading cause of treatment failure and subsequent death. Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors, but its role in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) has not been determined yet. Procedures: RNA sequencing was applied to an ALL case with induction failure (IF) to identify the possible genetic events. A cytokine-dependent growth assay in Ba/F3 cells was used to test the leukemic transformation capacity of MEIS1-FOXO1. The propidium iodide (PI) staining method was used to evaluate the effect of MEIS1-FOXO1 on cycle distribution. FOXO1 transactivity was examined using a luciferase reporter assay. FOXO1 mRNA expression levels were examined using real-time quantitative PCR among 40 children with B-ALL treated with the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol. Association analysis was performed to test the correlation of FOXO1 transcription with childhood B-ALL prognosis and relapse in a series of GEO datasets. An MTT assay was performed to test the drug sensitivity. Results: In this ALL case with IF, we identified a novel MEIS1-FOXO1 fusion gene. The transactivity of MEIS1-FOXO1 was significantly lower than that of wild-type FOXO1. MEIS1-FOXO1 potentiated leukemia transformation and promoted Ba/F3 cell cycle S-phase entry. Low FOXO1 transcription levels were found to be strongly associated with unfavorable ALL subtype, minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity, and relapse. Lower FOXO1 expression was associated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide resistance. Conclusions: Low FOXO1 transcription was associated with high-risk stratification and relapse in children with B-ALL, probably due to multi-drug resistance.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Zheng, Jiang, Liu, Hao, Wang, Huang, Li, Qian, Qian and Zhang.']","['Zheng, Qingqing', 'Jiang, Chuang', 'Liu, Haiyan', 'Hao, Wenge', 'Wang, Pengfei', 'Huang, Haiying', 'Li, Ziping', 'Qian, Jiabi', 'Qian, Maoxiang', 'Zhang, Hui']","['Zheng Q', 'Jiang C', 'Liu H', 'Hao W', 'Wang P', 'Huang H', 'Li Z', 'Qian J', 'Qian M', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics and Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, International Co-laboratory of Medical Epigenetics and Metabolism, Ministry of Science and Technology, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201111,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7686545,['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXO1', '*MRD-minimal residual disease', '*acute lymphoblast leukemia', '*relapse', '*risk stratification']",,2020/12/03 06:00,2020/12/03 06:01,['2020/12/02 05:33'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/02 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/03 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 11;10:579673. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.579673. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.579673 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.579673 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the anti-leukemic effects of sesamin and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in MOLT-4 and NB4 acute leukemic cells. Leukemic cells were treated with various concentrations of sesamin. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and anti-LC3/FITC antibodies was applied to detect the level of apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to examine the alterations in the mRNA expression of apoptotic and autophagic genes. In addition, bioinformatics tools were used to predict the possible interactions between sesamin and its targets. The results revealed that sesamin inhibited MOLT-4 and NB4 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, sesamin induced both apoptosis and autophagy. In sesamin-treated cells, the gene expression levels of caspase 3 and unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) were upregulated, while those of mTOR were downregulated compared with in the control. Notably, the protein-chemical interaction network indicated that caspase 3, mTOR and ULK1 were the essential factors involved in the effects of sesamin treatment, as with anticancer agents, such as rapamycin, AZD8055, Torin1 and 2.

We aimed to determine LINC00239 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and examine the influences of LINC00239 on tumor behaviors of CRC cells. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the actions of LINC00239 in CRC was unveiled in detail. Materials and Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect LINC00239 expression in CRC tissues and cell lines. CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were investigated by cell counting kit-8 assays, flow cytometry, and cell migration and invasion assays, respectively. Tumor xenograft experiments were performed to evaluate the tumor growth of CRC cells in vivo. The interactions among LINC00239, microRNA-484 (miR-484), and kruppel-like factor 12 (KLF12) were analyzed by bioinformatics prediction, RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay. Results: LINC00239 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. LINC00239 knockdown impaired CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, LINC00239 deficiency inhibited CRC growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00239 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by directly sponging miR-484, thereby enhancing KLF12 expression. Rescue experiments further corroborated that miR-484 inhibition or KLF12 overexpression reversed the inhibitory actions of LINC00239 knockdown in CRC cells.

Little is known about its pathogenesis and genetic features. We analyzed the mutational features of purified bone marrow plasma cells from 42 patients newly diagnosed with POEMS syndrome using a two-step strategy. Whole exome sequencing of ten patients showed a total of 170 somatic mutations in exonic regions and splicing sites, with paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a control. Three significantly mutated genes-LILRB1 (10%), HEATR9 (20%), and FMNL2 (10%)-and eight mutated known driver genes (MYD88, NFKB2, CHD4, SH2B3, POLE, STAT3, CHD3, and CUX1) were identified. Target region sequencing of 77 genes were then analyzed to validate the mutations in an additional 32 patients. A total of 32 mutated genes were identified, and genes recurrently mutated in more than three patients included CUX1 (19%), DNAH5 (16%), USH2A (16%), KMT2D (16%), and RYR1 (12%). Driver genes of multiple myeloma (BIRC3, LRP1B, KDM6A, and ATM) and eleven genes reported in light-chain amyloidosis were also identified in target region sequencing. Notably, VEGFA mutations were detected in one patient. Our study revealed heterogeneous genomic profiles of bone marrow plasma cells in POEMS syndrome, which might share some similarity to that of other plasma cell diseases.",,"['Chen, Jia', 'Gao, Xue-Min', 'Zhao, Hao', 'Cai, Hao', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Cao, Xin-Xin', 'Zhou, Dao-Bin', 'Li, Jian']","['Chen J', 'Gao XM', 'Zhao H', 'Cai H', 'Zhang L', 'Cao XX', 'Zhou DB', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 100730, Beijing, China. lijian@pumch.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201201,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2020/12/03 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/12/02 05:31'],"['2020/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/02 05:31 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Apr;35(4):1100-1107. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01101-4.

While clinical trials of MDM2 inhibitors have shown promise, responses have been confined to largely molecularly undefined patients, indicating that new biomarkers and optimized treatment strategies are needed. We previously reported that the microRNA miR-10a is strongly overexpressed in some AML, and demonstrate here that it modulates several key members of the p53/Rb network, including p53 regulator MDM4, Rb regulator RB1CC1, p21 regulator TFAP2C, and p53 itself. The expression of both miR-10a and its downstream targets were strongly predictive of MDM2 inhibitor sensitivity in cell lines, primary AML specimens, and correlated to response in patients treated with both MDM2 inhibitors and cytarabine. Furthermore, miR-10a inhibition induced synergy between MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a and cytarabine in both in vitro and in vivo AML models. Mechanistically this synergism primarily occurs via the p53-mediated activation of cytotoxic apoptosis at the expense of cytoprotective autophagy. Together these findings demonstrate that miR-10a may be useful as both a biomarker to identify patients most likely to respond to cytarabine+MDM2 inhibition and also a druggable target to increase their efficacy.",,"['Vu, Thi Thanh', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Wang, Kristy W', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Tursky, Melinda L', 'Molloy, Timothy J', 'Ma, David D']","['Vu TT', 'Stolzel F', 'Wang KW', 'Rollig C', 'Tursky ML', 'Molloy TJ', 'Ma DD']","[""Blood, Stem Cell, and Cancer Research Programme, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research and Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Dresden, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', ""Blood, Stem Cell, and Cancer Research Programme, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research and Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Dresden, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', ""Blood, Stem Cell, and Cancer Research Programme, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research and Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Blood, Stem Cell, and Cancer Research Programme, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research and Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia. t.molloy@amr.org.au."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. t.molloy@amr.org.au."", ""Blood, Stem Cell, and Cancer Research Programme, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research and Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia. d.ma@amr.org.au."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. d.ma@amr.org.au.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201201,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC8257503,,,,2020/12/03 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/12/02 05:31'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/02 05:31 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jul;35(7):1933-1948. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01095-z.

To investigate acquisition of CNAs and their prognostic relevance in context of first-line therapy, we profiled tumor diagnosis-relapse pairs from 178 NCRI Myeloma XI (ISRCTN49407852) trial patients using digital multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. CNA profiles acquired at relapse differed substantially between MM subtypes: hyperdiploid (HRD) tumors evolved predominantly in branching pattern vs. linear pattern in t(4;14) vs. stable pattern in t(11;14). CNA acquisition also differed between subtypes based on CCND expression, with a marked enrichment of acquired del(17p) in CCND2 over CCND1 tumors. Acquired CNAs were not influenced by high-dose melphalan or lenalidomide maintenance randomization. A branching evolution pattern was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) 2.61, P = 0.0048). As an individual lesion, acquisition of gain(1q) at relapse was associated with shorter OS, independent of other risk markers or time of relapse (HR = 2.00; P = 0.021).

By studying metastasis in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-driven lung cancer models, microarray time-series data analysis by systems biology approaches revealed BM-MSC-induced signaling triggers early dissemination of CD133(+)/CD83(+) cancer stem cells (CSCs) from primary sites shortly after STAT3 activation but promotes proliferation towards secondary sites. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by BM-MSC-secreted LIF and activated LIFR/p-ERK/pS727-STAT3 signaling to promote early disseminated cancer cells MET and premetastatic niche formation. Then, tumor-tropic BM-MSCs circulated to primary sites and triggered CD151(+)/CD38(+) cells acquiring EMT-associated CSC properties through IL6R/pY705-STAT3 signaling to promote tumor initiation and were also attracted by and migrated towards the premetastatic niche.

No current model includes covariates related to immune cells in the AML microenvironment. Here, an immune risk score was explored to predict the survival of patients with AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the predictive accuracy of several in silico algorithms for immune composition in AML based on a reference of multi-parameter flow cytometry. CIBERSORTx was chosen to enumerate immune cells from public datasets and develop an immune risk score for survival in a training cohort using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model. RESULTS: Six flow cytometry-validated immune cell features were informative. The model had high predictive accuracy in the training and four external validation cohorts. Subjects in the training cohort with low scores had prolonged survival compared with subjects with high scores, with 5-year survival rates of 46% versus 19% (P < 0.001). Parallel survival rates in validation cohorts-1, -2, -3, and -4 were 46% versus 6% (P < 0.001), 44% versus 18% (P = 0.041), 44% versus 24% (P = 0.004), and 62% versus 32% (P < 0.001). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment of immune relation pathways in the low-score cohort. In multivariable analyses, high-risk score independently predicted shorter survival with HRs of 1.45 (P = 0.005), 2.12 (P = 0.004), 2.02 (P = 0.034), 1.66 (P = 0.019), and 1.59 (P = 0.001) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively.

Whether tumors with a low mutational burden are susceptible to neoantigen-targeted therapy has not been fully addressed. To examine the feasibility of neoantigen-specific adoptive T-cell therapy, the authors studied the T-cell response against somatic variants in five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a malignancy with a very low tumor mutational burden. DNA and RNA from tumor (CD34(+)) and normal (CD3(+)) cells isolated from the patients' blood were sequenced to predict patient-specific MDS neopeptides. Neopeptides representing the somatic variants were used to induce and expand autologous T cells ex vivo, and these were systematically tested in killing assays to determine the proportion of neopeptides yielding neoantigen-specific T cells. The authors identified a total of 32 somatic variants (four to eight per patient) and found that 21 (66%) induced a peptide-specific T-cell response and 19 (59%) induced a T-cell response capable of killing autologous tumor cells. Of the 32 somatic variants, 11 (34%) induced a CD4(+) response and 11 (34%) induced a CD8(+) response that killed the tumor. These results indicate that in vitro induction of neoantigen-specific T cells is feasible for tumors with very low mutational burden and that this approach warrants investigation as a therapeutic option for such patients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.

The antiproliferative activity of the studied compounds was tested on five different cell lines that represent several types of tumours; glioblastoma, leukemia, breast, pancreatic and colon. Additionally, we also tested their selectivity towards normal cells. We performed molecular biology studies in order to detect the response of a cell to its treatment with the compounds that were tested. We looked at the in-depth changes in the proteins and cellular pathways that lead to cell cycle inhibition (G0/G1 and S), and consequently, death on the apoptosis and autophagy pathways.

When planning the sequencing of a large cohort of samples, library size is a fundamental factor affecting both the overall cost and the quality of the results. Here we specifically address how overall library size influences the detection of somatic mutations in RNA-seq data in two acute myeloid leukaemia datasets. RESULTS : We simulated shallower sequencing depths by downsampling 45 acute myeloid leukaemia samples (100 bp PE) that are part of the Leucegene project, which were originally sequenced at high depth. We compared the sensitivity of six methods of recovering validated mutations on the same samples. The methods compared are a combination of three popular callers (MuTect, VarScan, and VarDict) and two filtering strategies. We observed an incremental loss in sensitivity when simulating libraries of 80M, 50M, 40M, 30M and 20M fragments, with the largest loss detected with less than 30M fragments (below 90%, average loss of 7%). The sensitivity in recovering insertions and deletions varied markedly between callers, with VarDict showing the highest sensitivity (60%). Single nucleotide variant sensitivity is relatively consistent across methods, apart from MuTect, whose default filters need adjustment when using RNA-Seq. We also analysed 136 RNA-Seq samples from the TCGA-LAML cohort (50 bp PE) and assessed the change in sensitivity between the initial libraries (average 59M fragments) and after downsampling to 40M fragments. When considering single nucleotide variants in recurrently mutated myeloid genes we found a comparable performance, with a 6% average loss in sensitivity using 40M fragments. CONCLUSIONS: Between 30M and 40M 100 bp PE reads are needed to recover 90-95% of the initial variants on recurrently mutated myeloid genes. To extend this result to another cancer type, an exploration of the characteristics of its mutations and gene expression patterns is suggested.",,"['Quaglieri, Anna', 'Flensburg, Christoffer', 'Speed, Terence P', 'Majewski, Ian J']","['Quaglieri A', 'Flensburg C', 'Speed TP', 'Majewski IJ']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, 3052, Australia. quaglieri.a@wehi.edu.au.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Grattan St, Melbourne, 3010, Australia. quaglieri.a@wehi.edu.au.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, 3052, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, 3052, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Grattan St, Melbourne, 3010, Australia.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, 813 Swanston Street, Melbourne, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, 3052, Australia. majewski@wehi.edu.au.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Grattan St, Melbourne, 3010, Australia. majewski@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201201,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC7708150,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer RNA-Seq', 'Library size', 'Sequencing depth', 'Variant calling']",,2020/12/03 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/12/02 05:20'],"['2020/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/02 05:20 [entrez]', '2020/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 Dec 1;21(1):553. doi: 10.1186/s12859-020-03860-4.,20201216,10.1186/s12859-020-03860-4 [doi],,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Library', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'RNA-Seq/*methods']","['10.1186/s12859-020-03860-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-020-03860-4 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6087-635X'],,"['1054618/National Health and Medical Research Council', '1145912/National Health and Medical Research Council', '1124178/Cancer Council Victoria', 'Operational Infrastructure Support/State Government of Victoria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we developed a 3D model of Klebsiella pneumoniae histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and analyzed the HDC inhibitory potential of cinnamaldehyde (CA) and subsequent anti-allergic potential using a bacterial and mammalian mast cell model. A computational and in vitro study using K. pneumonia revealed that CA binds to HDC nearby the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) binding site and inhibited histamine synthesis in a bacterial model. Further study using a mammalian mast cell model also showed that CA decreased the levels of histamine in the stimulated RBL-2H3 cell line and attenuated the release of beta-hexoseaminidase and cell degranulation. In addition, CA treatment also significantly suppressed the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 and the nitric oxide (NO) level in the stimulated mast cells. A gene expression and Western blotting study revealed that CA significantly downregulated the expressions of MAPKp38/ERK and its downstream pro-allergic mediators that are involved in the signaling pathway in mast cell cytokine synthesis.

However, the molecular function of some CHD proteins in stem cell regulation is still poorly understood. Herein, we show that Chd9 knockdown (KD) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in normal serum media, not in 2i-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) media, causes rapid cell proliferation. This is caused by transcriptional regulation related to the cell cycle and the response to growth factors. Our analysis showed that, unlike the serum cultured-Chd9 KD ESCs, the 2i-LIF-cultured-Chd9 KO ESCs displayed elevated levels of critical G1 phase regulators such as p21 and p27. Consistently, the DNA binding sites of CHD9 overlap with some transcription factor DNA motifs that are associated with genes regulating the cell cycle and growth pathways. These transcription factors include the cycle gene homology region (CHR), Arid5a, and LIN54.

Among them, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is involved in signal transduction of cytokines such as interferon (IFN) alpha/beta through IFN-alpha/beta receptor alpha chain (IFNAR1). To search for disease-associated TYK2 variants, bone marrow samples from 62 B-ALL patients at diagnosis were analysed by next-generation sequencing. TYK2 variants were found in 16 patients (25.8%): one patient had a novel mutation at the four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain (S431G) and two patients had the rare variants rs150601734 or rs55882956 (R425H or R832W). To functionally characterise them, they were generated by direct mutagenesis, cloned in expression vectors, and transfected in TYK2-deficient cells. Under high-IFNalpha doses, the three variants were competent to phosphorylate STAT1/2. While R425H and R832W induced STAT1/2-target genes measured by qPCR, S431G behaved as the kinase-dead form of the protein. None of these variants phosphorylated STAT3 in in vitro kinase assays. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that TYK2/IFNAR1 interaction is not affected by these variants. Finally, qPCR analysis revealed diminished expression of TYK2 in B-ALL patients at diagnosis compared to that in healthy donors, further stressing the tumour immune surveillance role of TYK2.",,"['Turrubiartes-Martinez, Edgar', 'Bodega-Mayor, Irene', 'Delgado-Wicke, Pablo', 'Molina-Jimenez, Francisca', 'Casique-Aguirre, Diana', 'Gonzalez-Andrade, Martin', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Camos, Mireia', 'Diaz-de-Heredia, Cristina', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Ramirez-Orellana, Manuel', 'Aguado, Beatriz', 'Figuera, Angela', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Fernandez-Ruiz, Elena']","['Turrubiartes-Martinez E', 'Bodega-Mayor I', 'Delgado-Wicke P', 'Molina-Jimenez F', 'Casique-Aguirre D', 'Gonzalez-Andrade M', 'Rapado I', 'Camos M', 'Diaz-de-Heredia C', 'Barragan E', 'Ramirez-Orellana M', 'Aguado B', 'Figuera A', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Fernandez-Ruiz E']","['Molecular Biology Unit, University Hospital La Princesa and Research Institute (IIS-IP), Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, University Hospital La Princesa and Research Institute (IIS-IP), Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, University Hospital La Princesa and Research Institute (IIS-IP), Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, University Hospital La Princesa and Research Institute (IIS-IP), Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, Latin University of Mexico (ULM), Avenida San Jose 100, 38085 Celaya, Mexico.', 'Biosensors and Molecular Modelling Lab, Biochemistry Department, Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM), 04510 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Haematology Department, University Hospital 12 Octubre and Research Institute (i+12), Avenida de Cordoba s/n., 28041 Madrid, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, University Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Research Institute (IRSJD), Passeig Sant Joan de Deu 2, 08950 Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain.', ""Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Department, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron and Research Institute (VHIR), Passeig de la Vall d'Hebron 119-129, 08035 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Molecular Biology Lab, Clinical Analysis Department, University and Polytechnic Hospital and IIS La Fe, Avenida de Fernando Abril Martorell 106, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Department, Paediatric University Hospital Nino Jesus (IIS-IP), Avenida de Menendez Pelayo 65, 28009 Madrid, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, University Hospital La Princesa (IIS-IP), 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, University Hospital La Princesa (IIS-IP), 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, University Hospital 12 Octubre and Research Institute (i+12), Avenida de Cordoba s/n., 28041 Madrid, Spain.', 'Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, University Hospital La Princesa and Research Institute (IIS-IP), Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Autonomous University of Madrid, 28049 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201128,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC7761059,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*IFNalpha', '*IFNalpha/beta receptor alpha chain (IFNAR1), next-generation sequencing', '*TYK2 expression', '*TYK2 variants', '*immune surveillance', '*molecular dynamics']","['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The aims of the study are to investigate the rates and distribution of second primary malignant tumours in Belarus survivors of post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinoma and the cumulative rate of developing a second primary malignancy in a group of patients with metachronous second primaries. METHODS: Patients aged 18 or younger at the time of Chernobyl accident who were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma after 1986 were identified from the Belarus Cancer Registry. The clinical and demographic of these patients were analysed to correlate with the factors for the development of secondary primary cancer. RESULTS: Secondary primary cancer was detected in 1.8 % (119 of 6559) of the patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The cumulative incidence tended to rise with increasing age of the cohort and varied depending on the sex of patients. In female patients, breast carcinoma and genital tract carcinomas prevailed, in men patients - lymphoma/ leukaemia and the alimentary tract malignancies predominated. A significant excess risk was revealed for breast carcinoma in females, colon carcinoma in males, and the urinary system carcinomas in males (absolute excess risk [AER] = 3.23, 3.01 and 2.17 correspondingly). Overall, our results pointed to the increased risk of new solid primaries in females, males and both genders (AER = 3.31, 7.19, 4.28 correspondingly) as well as increase risk of lymphoid/hematopoietic malignancies in females and both genders (AER = 1.24) and leukaemia in male patients (AER = 1.45). CONCLUSION: Patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma after Chernobyl accident are at risk of secondary primary malignancy. Awareness and screening of secondary cancer is needed for patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma after Chernobyl accident.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated five BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines derived from drug-naive tumor specimens to assess cell death response to encorafenib (Braftovi), a recently FDA-approved BRAF(V600) inhibitor. Drug-naive cell lines (i) did not harbor damaging alterations in genes encoding core apoptotic machinery, but they differed in (ii) mitochondrial priming as demonstrated by whole-cell BH3 profiling, and (iii) levels of selected anti-apoptotic proteins. Encorafenib modulated the balance between apoptosis-regulating proteins as it upregulated BIM and BMF, and attenuated NOXA, but did not affect the levels of pro-survival proteins except for MCL-1 and BCL-XL in selected cell lines. Induction of apoptosis could be predicted using Dynamic BH3 profiling. The extent of apoptosis was dependent on both (i) cell-intrinsic proximity to the apoptotic threshold (initial mitochondrial priming) and (ii) the abundance of encorafenib-induced BIM (iBIM; drug-induced change in priming). While co-inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-XL/BCL-2 was indispensable for apoptosis in drug-naive cells, encorafenib altered cell dependence to MCL-1, and reliance on BCL-XL/BCL-2 was additionally found in cell lines that were highly primed to apoptosis by encorafenib. This translated into robust apoptosis when encorafenib was combined with selective BH3 mimetics. Our study provides a mechanistic insight into the role of proteins from the BCL-2 family in melanoma cell response to targeted therapy, and presents preclinical evidence that (i) MCL-1 is a druggable target to potentiate encorafenib activity, whereas (ii) pharmacological inhibition of BCL-XL/BCL-2 might be relevant but only for a narrow group of encorafenib-treated patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Initially identified as a factor that inhibits the proliferation of murine myeloid leukemia cells, LIF displays a wide variety of important functions in a cell-, tissue- and context-dependent manner in many physiological and pathological processes, including regulating cell proliferation, pluripotent stem cell self-renewal, tissue/organ development and regeneration, neurogenesis and neural regeneration, maternal reproduction, inflammation, infection, immune response, and metabolism. Emerging evidence has shown that LIF plays an important but complex role in human cancers; while LIF displays a tumor suppressive function in some types of cancers, including leukemia, LIF is overexpressed and exerts an oncogenic function in many more types of cancers. Further, targeting LIF has been actively investigated as a novel strategy for cancer therapy. This review summarizes the recent advances in the studies on LIF in human cancers and its potential application in cancer therapy. A better understanding of the role of LIF in different types of cancers and its underlying mechanisms will help to develop more effective strategies for cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

The aim of the study was to define the circRNA landscape and potential impact in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Analysis by CirComPara of RNA-sequencing data from 25 T-ALL patients, immature, HOXA overexpressing, TLX1, TLX3, TAL1, or LMO2 rearranged, and from thymocyte populations of human healthy donors disclosed 68 554 circRNAs. Study of the top 3447 highly expressed circRNAs identified 944 circRNAs with significant differential expression between malignant T cells and normal counterparts, with most circRNAs displaying increased expression in T-ALL. Next, we defined subtype-specific circRNA signatures in molecular genetic subgroups of human T-ALL. In particular, circZNF609, circPSEN1, circKPNA5, and circCEP70 were upregulated in immature, circTASP1, circZBTB44, and circBACH1 in TLX3, circHACD1, and circSTAM in HOXA, circCAMSAP1 in TLX1, and circCASC15 in TAL-LMO. Backsplice sequences of 14 circRNAs ectopically expressed in T-ALL were confirmed, and overexpression of circRNAs in T-ALL with specific oncogenic lesions was substantiated by quantification in a panel of 13 human cell lines. An oncogenic role of circZNF609 in T-ALL was indicated by decreased cell viability upon silencing in vitro. Furthermore, functional predictions identified circRNA-microRNA gene axes informing modes of circRNA impact in molecular subtypes of human T-ALL.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Buratin, Alessia', 'Paganin, Maddalena', 'Gaffo, Enrico', 'Dal Molin, Anna', 'Roels, Juliette', 'Germano, Giuseppe', 'Siddi, Maria Teresa', 'Serafin, Valentina', 'De Decker, Matthias', 'Gachet, Stephanie', 'Durinck, Kaat', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruij', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Bortoluzzi, Stefania']","['Buratin A', 'Paganin M', 'Gaffo E', 'Dal Molin A', 'Roels J', 'Germano G', 'Siddi MT', 'Serafin V', 'De Decker M', 'Gachet S', 'Durinck K', 'Speleman F', 'Taghon T', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Bortoluzzi S']","['Department of Biology and.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Fondazione Citta della Speranza Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Fondazione Citta della Speranza Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Fondazione Citta della Speranza Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'INSERM U944 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR7212, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Saint Louis Research Institute (IRSL), Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; and.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Interdepartmental Research Center for Innovative Biotechnologies (CRIBI), University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC7724907,,,,2020/12/02 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/01 17:10'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/01 17:10 [entrez]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Dec 8;4(23):5902-5914. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002337.,20210514,10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002337 [doi],"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ectopic Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Circular']","['S2473-9529(20)32015-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002337 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the effect of BTKi's on humoral immunity is timely because BTKi's are widely used and vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is urgently needed. In 2 open-label, single-arm clinical trials, we measured the effect of BTKi's on de novo immune response against recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-CpG) and recall response against recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in CLL patients who were TN or on BTKi. The primary end point was serologic response to HepB-CpG (anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies >/=10 mIU/mL) and RZV (>/=fourfold increase in anti-glycoprotein E). The response rate to HepB-CpG was lower in patients on BTKi (3.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-18.9) than patients who were TN (28.1%; 95% CI, 15.6-45.4; P = .017). In contrast, the response rate to RZV did not differ significantly between the BTKi (41.5%; 95% CI, 27.8-56.6) and TN cohorts (59.1%; 95% CI, 38.7-76.7; P = .2). BTKi's were associated with a decreased de novo immune response following HepB-CpG, whereas recall immune response following RZV was not significantly affected by BTKi therapy.

Importantly, we demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitors rapidly downregulate both Bfl-1 and Mcl-1, inducing apoptosis in BH3-mimetic-resistant lymphoma cell lines in vitro and driving in vivo tumor regressions in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient-derived xenograft models expressing Bfl-1.

Umbralisib, a novel highly selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta)/CK1epsilon inhibitor, is active and well tolerated in CLL patients. In this phase 2 trial (NCT02742090), umbralisib was initiated at 800 mg/d in CLL patients requiring therapy, who were intolerant to prior BTK inhibitor (BTKi) or PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) therapy, until progression or toxicity. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included time to treatment failure and safety. DNA was genotyped for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 polymorphisms.

This review describes the progress of leukemia research in the United States in recent years. Whereas the traditional method of treatment is chemotherapy, it is nonselective and could induce systemic toxicities. Thus, in parallel with research on new chemotherapies, great emphasis has been placed on developing immunotherapies. Here, we will review the current immunotherapies available in research and development that overcome current challenges, specifically looking in the field of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, checkpoint inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates. With about 100 clinical trials for CAR-T therapies and 30 in checkpoint inhibitors for leukemia treatment, scientists are trying to make these technologies cheaper, faster, and more feasible. Further describing the delivery of these therapeutics, we look at the current progress, clinical, and preclinical status of nano-based medicines such as liposomes, polymeric micelles, and metal nanoparticles. Taking advantage of their physicochemical and biologic properties, nanoparticles have been shown to increase the efficacy of commonly administered chemotherapies with reduced adverse effects.",['(c)2020 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Wan, Zhuoya', 'Sun, Runzi', 'Moharil, Pearl', 'Chen, Jing', 'Liu, Yuzhe', 'Song, Xu', 'Ao, Qiang']","['Wan Z', 'Sun R', 'Moharil P', 'Chen J', 'Liu Y', 'Song X', 'Ao Q']","['Institute of Regulatory Science for Medical Device, National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Institute of Regulatory Science for Medical Device, National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, Indiana, USA.', 'Institute of Regulatory Science for Medical Device, National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Institute of Regulatory Science for Medical Device, National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200817,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*hematology', '*immunotherapy', '*nanotechnology']",,2020/12/02 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/12/01 12:45'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/01 12:45 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2021 Feb;109(2):425-436. doi: 10.1002/JLB.5MR0620-063RR.

Because of the relative effectiveness, it is often a challenge for clinicians to determine how to best sequence these NAs with respect to efficacy and toxicity. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study of patients with RR ALL treated with blinatumomab, InO, or both, their efficacy as a first or second NA was compared. RESULTS: Among 276 patients, 221 and 55 received blinatumomab and InO, respectively, as a first NA therapy. The complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rate was 65% and 67% for the blinatumomab and InO groups, respectively (P = .73). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 4% and 7% in the blinatumomab and InO groups, respectively. Ninety-two patients (43%) in the blinatumomab group and 13 patients (29%) in the InO group proceeded with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The median overall survival (OS) was 15 and 11.6 months in the blinatumomab and InO groups, respectively. A subset analysis was performed for 61 patients who received both NAs (blinatumomab and then InO [n = 40] or InO and then blinatumomab [n = 21]). The CR/CRi rate was 58% for patients who received InO as the second NA and 52% for patients who received blinatumomab as the second NA. The median OS was 10.5 for patients who received InO as the second NA and 5.9 months for patients who received blinatumomab as the second NA (P = .09). CONCLUSIONS: Although the limited power of this study to detect a significant difference between subgroups is acknowledged, the data suggest that blinatumomab and InO may have comparable efficacy as a first or second NA therapy in RR ALL.",['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],"['Badar, Talha', 'Szabo, Aniko', 'Dinner, Shira', 'Liedtke, Michaela', 'Burkart, Madelyn', 'Shallis, Rory M', 'Yurkiewicz, Ilana R', 'Kuo, Eric', 'Khan, Muhammad Ali', 'Balasubramanian, Suresh', 'Yang, Jay', 'Hefazi, Mehrdad', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai', 'Patel, Anand', 'Curran, Emily', 'Wang, Amy', 'Arslan, Shukaib', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Siebenaller, Caitlin', 'Mattison, Ryan J', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Atallah, Ehab']","['Badar T', 'Szabo A', 'Dinner S', 'Liedtke M', 'Burkart M', 'Shallis RM', 'Yurkiewicz IR', 'Kuo E', 'Khan MA', 'Balasubramanian S', 'Yang J', 'Hefazi M', 'Podoltsev N', 'Patel A', 'Curran E', 'Wang A', 'Arslan S', 'Aldoss I', 'Siebenaller C', 'Mattison RJ', 'Litzow MR', 'Wadleigh M', 'Advani AS', 'Atallah E']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Robert H.

Changes in ASNase activity may lead to suboptimal treatment and poorer outcomes. The gut microbiome produces metabolites that could impact ASNase therapy, however, remains uninvestigated. We examined gut-microbial community and microbial-ASNase and asparagine synthetase (ASNS) genes using 16SrRNA and metagenomic sequence data from stool samples of pediatric ALL patients. Comparing ASNase activity between consecutive ASNase-doses, we found microbial communities differed between decreased- and increased-activity samples. Escherichia predominated in the decreased-activity community while Bacteroides and Streptococcus predominated in the increased-activity community. In addition microbial ASNS was significantly (p=.004) negatively correlated with change in serum ASNase activity. These preliminary findings suggest microbial communities prior to treatment could affect serum ASNase levels, although the mechanism is unknown.

We examined a cohort of children with ALL who received induction chemotherapy between January 2010 and May 2018. We evaluated 20 clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) and readmission and ICU admission rates. Outcomes were compared between standard 3- and 4-drug treatment regimens in multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard ratios. Among 486 eligible patients, the risks of sepsis (HR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.11-4.19), hypoxia (HR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.03-4.18), hyperbilirubinemia (HR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.07-5.74), hyperglycemia (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.29-5.42), thromboembolic event (HR = 4.50, 95% CI = 1.30-15.6), and hyponatremia (HR = 7.88, 95% CI = 1.26-49.4) were significantly higher during 4-drug induction. Despite no differences in readmission or ICU admission rates, 4-drug induction patients had greater total inpatient days (12 vs. 4 days; p<.0001).

Recently, interest has increased concerning preventing secondary complications (secondary cancer, endocrine disorders) in long-term survivors. We aimed to study the epidemiologic features and therapeutic outcomes of HL in children, adolescents, and young adults in Korea. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective study of 224 patients aged < 25 years diagnosed with HL at 22 participating institutes in Korea from January 2007 to August 2016. RESULTS: A higher percentage of males was diagnosed at a younger age. Nodular sclerosis histopathological HL subtype was most common, followed by mixed cellularity subtype. Eighty-one (36.2%), 101 (45.1%), and 42 (18.8%) patients were classified into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. Doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine was the most common protocol (n = 102, 45.5%). Event-free survival rate was 86.0% +/- 2.4%, while five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 96.1% +/- 1.4%: 98.7% +/- 1.3%, 97.7% +/- 1.6%, and 86.5% +/- 5.6% in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively (P = 0.021). Five-year OS was worse in patients with B-symptoms, stage IV disease, high-risk, splenic involvement, extra-nodal lymphoma, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. In multivariate analysis, B-symptoms and extra-nodal involvement were prognostic factors for poor OS. Late complications of endocrine disorders and secondary malignancy were observed in 17 and 6 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first study on the epidemiology and treatment outcomes of HL in children, adolescents, and young adults in Korea. Future prospective studies are indicated to develop therapies that minimize treatment toxicity while maximizing cure rates in children, adolescents, and young adults with HL.",['(c) 2020 The Korean

Since no current technique can detect all relevant abnormalities, technique(s) are chosen depending on the reason for referral, and abnormalities can be missed. We tested targeted transcriptome sequencing as a single platform to detect all relevant abnormalities and compared it to current techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed RNA-sequencing of 1385 genes (TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer, Illumina) in bone marrow from 136 patients with a primary diagnosis of HM. We then applied machine learning to expression profile data to perform leukemia classification, a method we named RANKING. Gene fusions for all the genes in the panel were detected, and overexpression of the genes EVI1, CCND1, and BCL2 was quantified. Single nucleotide variants/indels were analyzed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using a virtual myeloid (54 genes) or lymphoid panel (72 genes). RESULTS: RANKING correctly predicted the leukemia classification of all AML and ALL samples and improved classification in 3 patients. Compared to current methods, only one variant was missed, c.2447A>T in KIT (RT-PCR at 10-4), and BCL2 overexpression was not seen due to a t(14; 18)(q32; q21) in 2% of the cells. Our RNA-sequencing method also identified 6 additional fusion genes and overexpression of CCND1 due to a t(11; 14)(q13; q32) in 2 samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our combination of targeted RNA-sequencing and data analysis workflow can improve the detection of relevant variants, and expression patterns can assist in establishing HM classification.","['(c) American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

Previously, we achieved this using dynamic time warping to map the signal to a reference genome, but the method required substantial computational resources and did not scale to gigabase-sized references. Here we overcome this limitation by using graphical processing unit (GPU) base-calling.

Mechanisms underlying antileukemia benefit of CBT are not well understood, however a previous study strongly but indirectly implicated cells from the mother of the cord blood (CB) donor. A fetus acquires a small number of maternal cells referred to as maternal microchimerism (MMc) and MMc is sometimes detectable in CB. From a series of 95 patients who underwent double or single CBT at our center, we obtained or generated HLA-genotyping of CB mothers in 68. We employed a technique of highly sensitive HLA-specific quantitative-PCR assays targeting polymorphisms unique to the CB mother to assay CB-MMc in patients post-CBT. After additional exclusion criteria, CB-MMc was evaluated at multiple timepoints in 36 patients (529 specimens). CB-MMc was present in seven (19.4%) patients in bone marrow, peripheral blood, innate and adaptive immune cell subsets, and was detected up to 1-year post-CBT. Statistical trends to lower relapse, mortality, and treatment failure were observed for patients with vs. without CB-MMc post-CBT.

A small group of patients was found to express familial predisposition. Moreover, it may be preceded or followed by other malignancies elsewhere in the body. We aim to compare the incidence of UM and other associated cancers and study the factors that may influence each condition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have collected the data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database of nine US cancer registries for UM patients between 1973 and 2015. We calculated the standardised incidence ratios for single primary UM, first primary and second primary UM, and compared the groups for multiple factors. RESULTS: A total of 4946 patients were included in the study; 3863 with single primary UM, 646 developed a second primary malignancy following UM, and 437 patients developed second primary UM following a previous primary malignancy. The risk of developing UM increased after leukaemia, melanoma of the skin and prostate. On the other side, the risk of developing melanoma of the skin, thyroid, renal and other eye and orbit malignancies has increased significantly after initial UM. This risk was more evident in the age group between 50 and 70 years old. Cancer-specific survival was significantly higher in UM associated with other malignancies group compared with single primary UM. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a different behaviour of the UM when associated with other tumours that exceed the known spectrum of hereditary UM. Further studies are required to dissect the genetic background of this behaviour.","['(c) Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No', 'commercial re-use.

Patients with AMKL with non-Down syndrome (DS) had a poorer prognosis. However, clear prognostic indicators and treatment recommendations for this subgroup remain controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Herein, we performed a retrospective study on 40 patients (age </= 18 years) with non-Down syndrome AMKL at our institution. We assessed the effect of different prognostic factors, such as their cytogenetic abnormalities, early treatment response, and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as post-remission treatment on the outcomes. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate of the patients was 57.9% and 81.1%, respectively, at the end of induction therapy 1 and 2. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival rates at 2 years were 41% +/- 13% and 41% +/- 10%, respectively. An analysis of the cytogenetic features showed that patients with +21 or hyperdiploid (> 50 chromosomes) had significantly better OS than those in other cytogenetic subgroups (Plog-rank = .048 and Plog-rank = .040, respectively). Besides cytogenetics, an excellent early treatment response (CR and minimal residual disease < 1% after induction therapy 1) also provided a significant survival benefit in univariate analysis in our study. However, multivariate analysis indicated that allogeneic HSCT was the only independent prognostic marker (relative risk, 11.192; 95% confidence interval, 2.045-61.241; P = .005 for OS and relative risk, 5.400; 95% confidence interval, 1.635-17.832; P = .006 for event-free survival, respectively). CONCLUSION: AMKL in patients with non-Down syndrome has a poor outcome. With poor OS but CR rates comparable with other acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, allogenic HSCT may be a better option for post-remission therapy than conventional chemotherapy, especially for those having a poor response to induction therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Central to calibrating NK effector function via their interaction with class I human leukocyte antigens are the numerous inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR). The KIR receptors are encoded by a family of polymorphic genes, whose expression is largely stochastic and uninfluenced by human leukocyte antigens genotype. These features provide the opportunity to select hematopoietic cell donors with favorable KIR genotypes that confer enhanced protection from relapse via NK-mediated graft versus leukemia. Over the last 2 decades, a large body of work has emerged examining the use of KIR genotyping to stratify potential donors based on anticipated NK alloreactivity. Overall, these results support KIR-based donor selection for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia. Despite this, the underlying factors that control NK cell responsiveness are not completely understood, and opportunities remain to refine donor selection using NK cell receptor genotyping. In this review, we will summarize the relevant findings with respect to KIR genotyping as a selection parameter for allogeneic hematopoietic cell donors and address practical considerations with respect to KIR-based selection of donors for patients with myeloid neoplasia.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Stratification based on MRD maximizes treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects. Allele-specific real-time quantitative PCR of clone-defining immunoglobin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in the patients' leukemic clones and/or multiparametric flow cytometric tracking of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes are considered standard of care. Following recent advances in high throughput sequencing (HTS; next generation sequencing), much attention has been devoted to the development of HTS-based MRD assays, which can increase sensitivity; theoretically only limited by the number of cells input into the assay. Knowledge of the methods and limitations of each technology, along with awareness of the sensitivity and specificity of MRD at particular treatment time points is important in interpretation of the MRD value. MRD negativity at pre-established protocol-appropriate time points guides continuance with consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy, whereas positivity leads to a change to a biological therapy such as blinatumomab and intensification of therapy to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Positivity after maintenance may herald impending relapse enabling treatment intervention. MRD has been integral to the introduction of novel agents and cellular therapies into clinical trials and standard of care, but the long-term predictive value of MRD on outcome of novel therapies is not yet established. Integration of somatic genetics with MRD may further improve accurate identification of patients with the lowest and highest risk of relapse.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pediatric chemotherapy regimens produce long-term cure rates of 80% to 90% in children and 60% to 70% in adolescents and young adults with Ph-negative ALL, however, tolerability of intensive chemotherapy becomes problematic with advanced age due to comorbidities and reduced tolerability of chemotherapy leading to high rates of treatment-related mortality. For older adults with Ph-positive ALL, BCR-ABL1-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with corticosteroids or chemotherapy produce deep remissions with low treatment-related toxicity but optimal postremission therapy is not known. New therapeutic approaches for older adults with ALL involve integration of the novel targeted agents including monoclonal antibody-based therapy with blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin in the frontline. Ongoing studies will ideally define optimal combinations and sequencing of novel agents with or without chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and/or corticosteroids to maximize efficacy while avoiding treatment-related death. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells are a promising modality, with high rates of remission and minimal residual disease negativity achieved in early phase trials for adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL but the tolerability of chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell therapies in older adults is yet to be well defined. Advances in minimal residual disease detection have helped to effectively stratify adults in complete response in terms of relapse risk and predicted relative benefit for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. For older adults with ALL in complete response at high risk for relapse for whom myeloablative conditioning is predicted to result in excessive transplant-related mortality, reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is a less toxic approach for providing a graft-versus-leukemia effect and long-term disease control.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

An era of precision medicine with immunotherapy and other molecularly targeted treatments that offers unique opportunities to customize treatment intensity with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, reduce the burden of toxicities, and combat persistent residual disease. Recently approved agents for refractory/relapsed B-cell precursor ALL include the chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells, the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and the bispecific anti-CD19 T-cell engager, blinatumomab.

To this add the BH3 mimetics, venetoclax and navitoclax, which are being widely explored in refractory/relapsed as well as frontline settings for B- and T-cell ALL.

Such induced PSCs (iPSCs) can generate any cell type of the adult body or indefinitely proliferate without losing their potential. Accordingly, iPSCs can serve as an unlimited cell source for the development of various disease models and regenerative therapies for animals and humans. Although canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be easily obtained, they have a very low iPSC reprogramming efficiency. In this study, we determined the reprogramming efficiency of canine PBMCs under several conditions involving three types of media supplemented with small-molecule compounds. We found that canine iPSCs (ciPSCs) could be efficiently generated from PBMCs using N2B27 medium supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and a small-molecule cocktail (Y-27632, PD0325901, CHIR99021, A-83-01, Forskolin, and l-ascorbic acid). We generated five ciPSC lines that could be maintained in StemFit((R)) medium supplemented with LIF. The SeVdp(KOSM)302L vectors were appropriately silenced in four ciPSC lines. Of the two lines characterized, both were positive for alkaline phosphatase activity and expressed pluripotency markers, including the Oct3/4, Sox2, and Nanog transcripts, as well as the octamer-binding transcription factor (OCT) 3/4 and NANOG proteins, and the SSEA-1 carbohydrate antigen. The ciPSCs could form embryoid bodies and differentiate into the three germ layers, as indicated by marker gene and protein expression. Furthermore, one ciPSC line formed teratomas comprising several tissues from every germ layer. Our ciPSC lines maintained a normal karyotype even after multiple passages. Moreover, our new reprogramming method was able to generate ciPSCs from multiple donor PBMCs. In conclusion, we developed an easy and efficient strategy for the generation of footprint-free ciPSCs from PBMCs.

However, identifying correlations between AML molecular attributes and effective therapies is challenging. Recent advances in high-throughput in vitro drug sensitivity screening applied to primary AML blasts were used to uncover such correlations; however, these methods cannot predict the response of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Our study aimed to predict in vitro response to targeted therapies, based on molecular markers, with subsequent validation in LSCs. We performed ex vivo sensitivity screening to 46 drugs on 29 primary AML samples at diagnosis or relapse. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis we identified group with sensitivity to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including the multi-TKI, dasatinib, and searched for correlations between dasatinib response, exome sequencing and gene expression from our dataset and from the Beat AML dataset. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression resulted in clustering of dasatinib responders and non-responders. In vitro response to dasatinib could be predicted based on gene expression (AUC=0.78). Furthermore, mutations in FLT3/ITD and PTPN11 were enriched in the dasatinib sensitive samples as opposed to mutations in TP53 which were enriched in resistant samples. Based on these results, we selected FLT3/ITD AML samples and injected them to NSG-SGM3 mice. Our results demonstrate that in a subgroup of FLT3/ITD AML (4 out of 9) dasatinib significantly inhibits LSC engraftment. In summary we show that dasatinib has an anti-leukemic effect both on bulk blasts and, more importantly, LSCs from a subset of AML patients that can be identified based on mutational and expression profiles. Our data provide a rational basis for clinical trials of dasatinib in a molecularly selected subset of AML patients.",,"['Tavor, Sigal', 'Shalit, Tali', 'Chapal Ilani, Noa', 'Moskovitz, Yoni', 'Livnat, Nir', 'Groner, Yoram', 'Barr, Haim', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Plotnikov, Alexander', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Kaushansky, Nathali', 'Shlush, Liran I']","['Tavor S', 'Shalit T', 'Chapal Ilani N', 'Moskovitz Y', 'Livnat N', 'Groner Y', 'Barr H', 'Minden MD', 'Plotnikov A', 'Deininger MW', 'Kaushansky N', 'Shlush LI']","['Hemato-Oncology Department, Assuta Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'G-INCPM, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'G-INCPM, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN) Toronto, Canada.', 'G-INCPM, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201201,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC7726833,,,,2020/12/02 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/12/01 04:40'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/12/01 04:40 [entrez]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2020 Dec 1;105(12):2795-2804. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.240705.,20210427,10.3324/haematol.2019.240705 [doi],"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Transcriptome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['10.3324/haematol.2019.240705 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2020 Dec 01;105(12):2708-2710.

The management of lower-risk (LR) MDS with persistent cytopenias remains suboptimal. Eltrombopag (EPAG), a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, can improve platelet counts in LR-MDS and tri-lineage hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia (AA). We conducted a phase 2 dose modification study to investigate the safety and efficacy of EPAG in LR-MDS. EPAG dose was escalated from 50 mg/day, to a maximum of 150 mg/day over a period of 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was hematologic response at 16-20 weeks. Eleven of 25 (44%) patients responded; five and six patients had uni- or bi-lineage hematologic responses, respectively. The predictors of response were presence of a PNH clone, marrow hypocellularity, thrombocytopenia with or without other cytopenia, and elevated plasma thrombopoietin levels at study entry. The safety profile was consistent with previous EPAG studies in AA; no patients discontinued drug due to adverse events. Three patients developed reversible grade-3 liver toxicity and one patient had increased reticulin fibrosis. Ten patients discontinued EPAG after achieving a robust response (median time 16 months); four of them reinitiated EPAG due to declining counts, and all attained a second robust response. Six patients had disease progression not associated with expansion of mutated clones and no patient progressed to AML on study.

Method: The clinical data in 57 patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)were retrospective analyzed at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital from July 2010 to July 2019. All patients were performed bone marrow FCM and bone marrow pathological examination before final diagnoses were made. The golden diagnosis criterion was based on clinical, biochemical and histopathological evidence, which was regarded as the standard to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FCM analysis in diagnosing LAHS. Results: Among 57 cases, 36 cases were eventually diagnosed with LAHS, including 15 B-cell lymphoma(14 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 B-cell lymphoma with reactive T-cell hyperplasia), 13 aggressive NK/T cell lymphoma/leukemia, 2 cases of gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, 4 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 1 enteropathy-associated peripheral T-cell lymphoma and 1 anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. Lymphoma cells in bone marrow were detected in all patients by FCM except one ENTCL patient. The sensitivity and the specificity of FCM in LASH compared to bone marrow biopsy were 97.2%(P=0.014)and 90.5%(P=0.488) respectively. In the other 21 non-LAHS patients, T cell receptor Vbeta (TCRVbeta) rearrangement was detected in 2 patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated primary HLH. Conclusions: FCM effectively detects lymphoma cells in bone marrow of lymphoma patients with LHL, suggesting that FCM could be an important indicator for the diagnosis of LAHS. FCM also has the advantage in differentiating LAHS from other HLH.",,"['Zhang, W L', 'Xu, L', 'Zhang, Q', 'Zhong, F L', 'Dai, J', 'Feng, J', 'Sun, L H', 'Xu, H C', 'Xie, W Y', 'Zhang, H Y']","['Zhang WL', 'Xu L', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhong FL', 'Dai J', 'Feng J', 'Sun LH', 'Xu HC', 'Xie WY', 'Zhang HY']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma']",,2020/12/02 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/12/01 01:53'],"['2020/12/01 01:53 [entrez]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Dec 1;59(12):976-981. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200605-00560.,20210126,10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200605-00560 [doi],,IM,"['*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/diagnosis', '*Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200605-00560 [doi]'],,,,"['SZXJ2018081/Science and Research Projects of Shenzhen Municipal Commission of', 'Health and Family Planning', 'A2019540/Foundation:Medical Science and Technology Research Foundation of', 'Guangdong', 'SZSM201612004/Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen', 'JCYJ20170816161836562/Science and Research Projects of Shenzhen Science and', 'Technology Innovations Committee']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to critically review the literature on MRD status in the CBF-AML to determine the overall impact of MRD status on clinical outcomes. Published studies in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception up to 1 June 2019 were searched. The primary end-point was either overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) between MRD negative and MRD positive CBF-AML patients. The secondary variable was cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) between groups. Of the 736 articles, 13 relevant studies were included in this meta-analysis. The MRD negative group displayed more favorable recurrence-free survival (RFS) than those with MRD positivity, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 4.5. Moreover, OS was also superior in the MRD negative group, with a pooled OR of 7.88. Corroborating this, the CIR was statistically significantly lower in the MRD negative group, with a pooled OR of 0.06. The most common cutoff MRD level was 1 x 10(-3).

Among nearly 10,000 patients investigated so far, molecular analyses documented NPM1 mutations in around 2% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases, mainly belonging to MDS with excess of blasts, and 3% of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) cases, prevalently classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. These uncommon malignancies are associated with an aggressive clinical course, relatively rapid progression to overt acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor survival outcomes, raising controversies on their classification as distinct clinico-pathologic entities. Furthermore, fit patients with NPM1-mutated MNs with <20% blasts could benefit most from upfront intensive chemotherapy for AML rather than from moderate intensity MDS-directed therapies, although no firm conclusion can currently be drawn on best therapeutic approaches, due to the limited available data, obtained from small and mainly retrospective series. Caution is also suggested in definitely diagnosing NPM1-mutated MNs with blast count <20%, since NPM1-mutated AML cases frequently present dysplastic features and multilineage bone marrow cells showing abnormal cytoplasmic NPM1 protein delocalization by immunohistochemical staining, therefore belonging to NPM1-mutated clone regardless of blast morphology. Further prospective studies are warranted to definitely assess whether NPM1 mutations may become sufficient to diagnose AML, irrespective of blast percentage.",,"['Forghieri, Fabio', 'Nasillo,

The molecule of imatinib is flexible and contains several functional groups able to take part in H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Analysis of molecular conformations for this drug was carried out using density functional theory calculations of rotation potentials along single bonds and by analyzing crystal structures of imatinib-containing compounds taken from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank. Rotation along the N-C bond in the region of the amide group was found to be the reason for two relatively stable molecular conformations, an extended and a folded one. The role of various types of intermolecular interactions in stabilization of the particular molecular conformation was studied in terms of (i) the likelihood of H-bond formation, and (ii) their contribution to the Voronoi molecular surface. It is shown that experimentally observed hydrogen bonds are in accord with the likelihood of their formation. The number of H-bonds in ligand-receptor complexes surpasses that in imatinib salts due to the large number of donors and acceptors of H-bonding within the binding pocket of tyrosine kinases. Contribution of hydrophilic intermolecular interactions to the Voronoi molecular surface is similar for both conformations, while pi...pi stacking is more typical for the folded conformation of imatinib.",,"['Vologzhanina, Anna V', 'Ushakov, Ivan E', 'Korlyukov, Alexander A']","['Vologzhanina AV', 'Ushakov IE', 'Korlyukov AA']","['A.

Given the central role of metabolism in effective differentiation, we performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis of differentiating myeloid lineage cells from MDS bone marrow aspirates that exhibited <5% (G1) or >/=5% (G2) blasts, in order to delineate its role in MDS severity and malignant potential. Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 14 previously untreated MDS patients (G1, n = 10 and G2, n = 4) and age matched controls (n = 5). Following myeloid lineage cell isolation, untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis was performed. Data were processed and analyzed using Metabokit. Enrichment analysis was performed using Metaboanalyst v4 employing pathway-associated metabolite sets. We established a bioenergetic profile coordinated by the Warburg phenomenon in both groups, but with a massively different outcome that mainly depended upon its group mitochondrial function and redox state. G1 cells are overwhelmed by glycolytic intermediate accumulation due to failing mitochondria, while the functional electron transport chain and improved redox in G2 compensate for Warburg disruption. Both metabolomes reveal the production and abundance of epigenetic modifiers.

Monitoring of chimerism and specific molecular markers as a surrogate measure of relapse is not always helpful; therefore, improved systems to detect early relapse are needed. We hypothesized that the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) could be a suitable approach for personalized follow-up post-HSCT. To validate our hypothesis, we analyzed by NGS, a retrospective set of peripheral blood (PB) DNA samples previously evaluated by high-sensitive quantitative PCR analysis using insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indel-qPCR) chimerism engraftment. Post-HCST allelic burdens assessed by NGS and chimerism status showed a similar time-course pattern. At time of clinical relapse in 8/12 patients, we detected positive NGS-based minimal residual disease (NGS-MRD). Importantly, in 6/8 patients, we were able to detect NGS-MRD at time points collected prior to clinical relapse. We also confirmed the disappearance of post-HCST allelic burden in non-relapsed patients, indicating true clinical specificity. This study highlights the clinical utility of NGS-based post-HCST monitoring in myeloid neoplasia as a complementary specific analysis to high-sensitive engraftment testing.

We evaluated the impact of pan-RAF inhibition using LY3009120 in AML cells harboring mutations upstream and downstream of RAF. LY3009120 had anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and suppressed pERK1/2 levels in leukemic cells with RAS and FLT3 mutations. Using reverse protein phase array analysis, we identified reductions in the expression/activation of cell signaling components downstream of RAF (activated p38) and cell cycle regulators (Wee1/cyclin B1, Cdc2/Cdk1, activated Rb, etc.). Notably, LY3009120 potentiated the effect of Ara-C on AML cells and overcame bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell-mediated chemoresistance, with RAS-mutated cells showing a notable reduction in pAKT (Ser473). Furthermore, the combination of LY3009120 and sorafenib resulted in significantly higher levels of apoptosis in AML cells with heterozygous and hemizygous FLT3 mutations.

We investigated the frequency and type of STAT3/STAT5B mutations in FACS-sorted populations of expanded T/NK-LGL from 100 (82 clonal; 6 oligoclonal; 12 polyclonal) patients, and its relationship with disease features. Seventeen non-LGL T-CLPD patients and 628 age-matched healthy donors were analyzed as controls. STAT3 (n = 30) and STAT5B (n = 1) mutations were detected in 28/82 clonal T/NK-LGLL patients (34%), while absent (0/18, 0%) among oligoclonal/polyclonal LGL-lymphocytosis. Mutations were found across all diagnostic subgroups: TCD8(+)-LGLL, 36%; CLPD-NK, 38%; TCD4(+)-LGLL, 7%; Talphabeta(+)DP-LGLL, 100%; Talphabeta(+)DN-LGLL, 50%; Tgammadelta(+)-LGLL, 44%. STAT3-mutated T-LGLL/CLPD-NK showed overall reduced (p < 0.05) blood counts of most normal leukocyte subsets, with a higher rate (vs. nonmutated LGLL) of neutropenia (p = 0.04), severe neutropenia (p = 0.02), and cases requiring treatment (p = 0.0001), together with a shorter time-to-therapy (p = 0.0001), particularly in non-Y640F STAT3-mutated patients. These findings confirm and extend on previous observations about the high prevalence of STAT3 mutations across different subtypes of LGLL, and its association with a more marked decrease of all major

This microfluidic-based system can be used for rapid personalized differential diagnosis of acute promyelocyte leukemia (APL) with the aim of early initiation of individualized therapy. The fusion protein PML-RARalpha occurs in 95% of acute promyelocytic leukemia cases and is considered as diagnostically relevant. The fusion protein is formed as a result of translocation t(15,17) and is detected in the laboratory by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic methods require many laboratory steps with specialized staff. The developed microfluidic assay includes a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for PML-RARalpha on surface of magnetic microparticles in a microfluidic chip. A rapid detection of PML-RARalpha in cell lysates is achieved in less than one hour. A biotinylated PML-antibody on the surface of magnetic streptavidin coated microparticles is used as capture antibody. The bound translocation product is detected by a RARalpha antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the substrate QuantaRed. The analysis is performed in microfluidic channels which involves automated liquid processing with stringent washing and short incubation times. The results of the developed assay show that cell lysates of PML-RARalpha-positive cells (NB-4) can be clearly distinguished from PML-RARalpha-negative cells (HL-60, MV4-11).",,"['Emde, Benedikt', 'Kreher, Heike', 'Baumer, Nicole', 'Baumer, Sebastian', 'Bouwes, Dominique', 'Tickenbrock, Lara']","['Emde B', 'Kreher H', 'Baumer N', 'Baumer S', 'Bouwes D', 'Tickenbrock L']","['Department Hamm 1, Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Science, 59063 Hamm, Germany.', 'Micronit GmbH, 44263 Dortmund, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.', 'Micronit GmbH, 44263 Dortmund, Germany.', 'Department Hamm 1, Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Science, 59063 Hamm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201125,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7728129,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bio-microfluidics', 'lab-on-a-chip', 'magnetic bead-based immunoassay', 'personalized diagnostics and medicine']",,2020/12/02 06:00,2021/03/06 06:00,['2020/12/01 01:09'],"['2020/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/01 01:09 [entrez]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Nov 25;21(23). pii: ijms21238942. doi: 10.3390/ijms21238942.,20210305,E8942 [pii] 10.3390/ijms21238942 [doi],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Microfluidics/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Precision Medicine', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']","['ijms21238942 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21238942 [doi]']",,,,"['ZF4147102SB6/Research funded by ""Zentrales Innovationsprogramm Mittelstand (ZIM)""', 'by the ""Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Energie""']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we assessed the influence of treatment methods on the level of exercise capacity and the increase in sedentary behaviors. The study comprised 21 children (12 boys and 9 girls) undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 13) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 8). The subjects were aged 7-13 years (mean age 10.7, SD 2.0 years). Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by using the ergospirometry test. Progressive Godfrey protocol was performed. The level of physical activity was assessed by using the questions from the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC 2018) questionnaire. The study results showed that children undergoing leukemia treatment were characterized by a reduced level of exercise capacity. The measured value of VO2peak in the group of treated children was, on average, 22.16 mL.kg(-1).min(-1). The mean values of VO2peak predicted for this age group were 45.48 mL.kg(-1).min(-1) (SD, 3.8).

Some of the most important mutations that affect AML biology are represented by mutations in genes related to methylation, more specifically: TET2, IDH1, IDH2 and WT1. Because it has been shown in numerous studies that mutations in these genes lead to similar expression profiles and phenotypes in AML, we decided to assess if mutations in any of those genes interact with other genes important for AML. Materials and Methods: We downloaded the clinical data, mutational profile and expression profile from the TCGA LAML dataset via cBioPortal. Data were analyzed using classical statistical methods and functional enrichment analysis software represented by STRING and GOrilla. Results: The first step we took was to assess the 196 AML cases that had a mutational profile available and observe the mutations that overlapped with TET2/IDH1/2/WT1 mutations. We observed that RUNX1 mutations significantly overlap with TET2/IDH1/2/WT1 mutations. Because of this, we decided to further investigate the role of RUNX1 mutations in modulating the level of RUNX1 mRNA and observed that RUNX1 mutant cases presented higher levels of RUNX1 mRNA. Because there were only 16 cases of RUNX1 mutant samples and that mutations in this gene determined a change in mRNA expression, we further observed the correlation between RUNX1 and other mRNAs in subgroups regarding the presence of hypermethylating mutations and NPM1. Here, we observed that both TET2/IDH1/2/WT1 and NPM1 mutations increase the number of genes negatively correlated with RUNX1 and that these genes were significantly linked to myeloid activation. Conclusions: In the current study, we have shown that NPM1 and TET2/IDH1/2/WT1 mutations increase the number of negative correlations of RUNX1 with other transcripts involved in myeloid differentiation.",,"['Pasca, Sergiu', 'Jurj, Ancuta', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea']","['Pasca S', 'Jurj A', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Zdrenghea M']","['Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400349 Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400337 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400349 Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, 400124 Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 400012 Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, 400124 Cluj Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,PMC7760270,['NOTNLM'],"['NPM1', 'RUNX1', 'TET2', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",,2020/12/02 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/12/01 01:08'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/01 01:08 [entrez]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2020 Nov 24;56(12). pii: medicina56120637. doi: 10.3390/medicina56120637.,20210514,E637 [pii] 10.3390/medicina56120637 [doi],"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Epigenetic changes, including abnormal histone and DNA methylation, have been implicated in the pathogenic build-up of hematopoietic progenitors, but it is still unclear whether and how IDH mutations themselves affect hematopoiesis. Here, we show that IDH1-mutant mice develop myeloid dysplasia in that these animals exhibit anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, and increased immature progenitors and erythroblasts. In erythroid cells of these mice, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, an aberrant metabolite produced by the mutant IDH1 enzyme, inhibits oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and diminishes succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) production. This succinyl-CoA deficiency attenuates heme biosynthesis in IDH1-mutant hematopoietic cells, thus blocking erythroid differentiation at the late erythroblast stage and the erythroid commitment of hematopoietic stem cells, while the exogenous succinyl-CoA or 5-ALA rescues erythropoiesis in IDH1-mutant erythroid cells. Heme deficiency also impairs heme oxygenase-1 expression, which reduces levels of important heme catabolites such as biliverdin and bilirubin. These deficits result in accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species that induce the cell death of IDH1-mutant erythroid cells. Our results clearly show the essential role of IDH1 in normal erythropoiesis and describe how its mutation leads to myeloid disorders. These data thus have important implications for the devising of new treatments for IDH-mutant tumors.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gu, Yu', 'Yang, Risheng', 'Yang, Ying', 'Zhao, Yuanlin', 'Wakeham, Andrew', 'Li, Wanda Y', 'Tseng, Alan', 'Leca, Julie', 'Berger, Thorsten', 'Saunders, Mary', 'Fortin, Jerome', 'Gao, Xing', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Xiao, Liming', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Zhang, Lijun', 'Gao, Guangxun', 'Zhou, Wenjing', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Mak, Tak W', 'Ye, Jing']","['Gu Y', 'Yang R', 'Yang Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Wakeham A', 'Li WY', 'Tseng A', 'Leca J', 'Berger T', 'Saunders M', 'Fortin J', 'Gao X', 'Yuan Y', 'Xiao L', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang L', 'Gao G', 'Zhou W', 'Wang Z', 'Mak TW', 'Ye J']","['State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', ""Department of Pathology, Basic Medicine School, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Pathology, Basic Medicine School, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology-Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital.', ""Department of Pathology, Basic Medicine School, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Clinical Diagnosis, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China;

The outcomes were compared according to donor type. Most of the patients (60%) were transplanted for acute leukemia. Median follow-up was 1.6 years. Haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation was more frequently performed for acute myeloid leukemia and in late stages than any other donor type. Non-relapse mortality at 100 days and one year for unrelated and haploidentical donors were similar, 19%-29% vs. 17%-28%, respectively. A significant better non-relapse mortality was observed for matched sibling donors (7%-15%; p < 0.001). Relapse rate was higher in haploidentical donors compared to matched sibling and unrelated donors (three year relapse rate 46%, 39%, 28%; respectively p < 0.001). Haploidentical donors resulted in lower three year progression-free survival and worse 3 year overall survival (32%; p < 0.001 and 42%; p < 0.001) compared with other donors (44% and 55% MSD, 40% and 42% UD, respectively). The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was higher in unrelated donors (51% unrelated, 35% haploidentical, 36% matched sibling; respectively; p = 0.001), with no difference in grades III-IV (p = 0.73) or in chronic graft-versus-host disease (p = 0.2) between groups. After multivariate analysis, haploidentical and unrelated donors remained negatively associated with non-relapse mortality (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.10-3.20 and HR 2.70; 95% CI 1.63-4.46, respectively). Haploidentical donors were associated with a higher risk of relapse and worse overall survival.

The optimal extraction conditions were extracting temperature 90, pH 9 and the ratio of liquid to solid 30:1. Under these conditions, extraction yield of total polysaccharide was 6.5 % +/- 0.19 %. Total polysaccharide was then purified by DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-200 gel. Three fractions, PPP-1, PPP-2, and PPP-3, were identified with molecular weight of 463.70, 99.41, and 26.97 kDa, respectively. Three polysaccharide fractions were all composed of 10 monosaccharides in different proportions. Compared with PPP-1, which was mainly composed of glucose, PPP-2 and PPP-3 contained a higher proportion of galactose, glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid. The Congo red assay indicated that the PPP-2 may have a triple helical structure, while PPP-1 and PPP-3 were absent. In vitro assay showed that there was no significant cytotoxicity among the polysaccharide fractions under the concentration of 800 mug mL(-1) (P > 0.05). The antiviral test showed that PPP-2 had the strongest activity, indicating PPP-2 was the major antiviral component. The structure-activity relationship showed that the antiviral activities of polysaccharide fractions were affected by their monosaccharide composition, molecular weight, and triple helical structure, which was a result of a combination of multiple molecular structural factors. These results showed that the PPP-2 could be exploited as a valued product for replacing synthetic antiviral drugs, and provided support for future applications of polysaccharide from Pinus massoniana pollen as a useful source for antiviral agent.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Despite some advances in the development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3 inhibitors), most of FLT3-ITD AML patients suffer from lethal disease relapse, suggesting the requirement of novel targets and agents. Here we describe a natural small molecule, triptonide that can efficiently inhibit FLT3-ITD-driven AML in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, triptonide targeted Hedgehog/FLT3 signaling by inhibiting its critical effectors, which are GLI2, c-Myc and FLT3 and induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD-driven leukemia cells. In addition, we also observed that triptonide activated tumor suppressor p53. In vivo, triptonide treatment markedly suppressed lethal FLT3-ITD-driven AML with good tolerance and prolonged survival time in orthotopic mouse model. Our studies identify Hedgehog/FLT3 axis as a novel target for treating FLT3-ITD-driven leukemia and demonstrate that triptonide is an active lead compound that can kill FLT3-ITD-driven leukemia cells.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the dichloromethane-methanol (1:1) extract of the fruits of Tetrapleura tetraptera (TTF) and its constituents: (3R, 4S)-3,4-dimethyloxetan-2-one (1), luteolin (2), stigmasterol (4), 3-O-[6'-O-undecanoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]stigmasterol (6), olean-12-en-3-beta-O-D-glucopyranoside (7), 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranosylurs-12-en-28-oic acid (8), 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-27-hydroxyolean-12-ene-28-oic acid (9), methyl-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (10), beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 --> 1)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (11) towards a panel of cancer cell lines including MDR phenotypes. The cellular mode of induction of apoptosis by TTF and compound 7 was further investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay (RRA) was applied to determine the cytotoxicity of the studied samples. The cell cycle (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS; H2DCFH-DA) were measured by flow cytometry. Column chromatography was used for the purification of TTF, whilst nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis was applied for structural elucidation. RESULTS: The botanical, TTF and the phytochemicals, 2, 7, 8 and 9 as well as doxorubicin exerted cytotoxicity against 9 cancer cell lines including drug-sensitive and drug resistant phenotypes. TTF, compound 7 and doxorubicin were the most active samples, and displayed IC50 values ranging from 10.27 mug/mL (in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 23.61 mug/mL (against HCT116 p53(-/-) colon adenocarcinoma cells) for TTF, from 4.76 muM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 12.92 muM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for compound 7, and from 0.02 muM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 muM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. TTF induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells through MMP alteration and increased ROS production while compound 7 induced apoptosis mediated by caspases activation, MMP alteration and increased ROS production. CONCLUSION: Tetrapleura tetraptera and some of its constituents, mostly compound 7 are good cytotoxic natural products that should be explored in depth to develop new drugs to fight cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

But its role in hematopoietic recovery after acute myelosuppression is still unknown. We aim to explore the function and underlining mechanisms of Clod-Lip on hematopoietic reconstitution after sublethal dose irradiation in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice at 8-10 weeks received a total-body sublethal dose gamma-irradiation (TBI) and injected with Clod-Lip or PBS-Liposomes (PBS-Lip) every 4 days after TBI. The survival rate of each group was recorded. Flow cytometry was used to analyze changes in hematopoietic stem cells and their progenies in bone marrow. ELISA and RT-qPCR were used for the analysis of hematopoietic regulatory factors. Regarding IL-1beta inhibition, 25 mg/kg diacerein or an equal volume of DMSO was intraperitoneally injected into mice every day after TBI. RESULTS: In sublethal dose-irradiated mice, Clod-Lip reduced the survival rate, the total number of bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells, delayed peripheral blood recovery of red blood cells and platelets. However, it could increase the number of CMP, MEP and myeloid cells, which suggested that Clod-Lip could induce HSC to myeloid differentiation in vivo. We further verified that Clod-Lip may induce myeloid differentiation by bone marrow microenvironmental factor IL-1beta.

However, it is often accompanied by severe acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), which is the most serious complication after haploidentical HSCT. Thus, it is important to control the severity of aGVHD while maintaining the GVL effect. In our experience of pediatric haploidentical HSCT, it takes several days for aGVHD to become severe after the appearance of initial symptoms, mostly skin rashes. In this study, we aimed to identify useful biomarkers at the onset of aGVHD that predict subsequent development of severe aGVHD. METHODS: Forty-five consecutive children with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia or lymphoma who developed aGVHD after haploidentical HSCT were enrolled. We analyzed possible biomarkers from samples collected at the onset of acute GVHD. RESULTS: Nineteen patients developed grade 1-2 aGVHD, and 26 patients developed grade 3-4 aGVHD. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics between the two groups. Transplant-related mortality occurred only in the grade 3-4 aGVHD group (34.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that serum albumin was an independent biomarker for predicting the severity of aGVHD (P = 0.009). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of serum albumin was 0.864. CONCLUSIONS: The serum albumin level at the onset of aGvHD could be a useful biomarker for the development of subsequent severe aGVHD in pediatric patients after haploidentical HSCT.",['(c) 2020 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Takahashi, Nobuhisa', 'Mochizuki, Kazuhiro', 'Sano, Hideki', 'Kobayashi, Shogo', 'Ohara, Yoshihiro', 'Ikeda, Kazuhiko', 'Ohto, Hitoshi', 'Kikuta, Atsushi']","['Takahashi N', 'Mochizuki K', 'Sano H', 'Kobayashi S', 'Ohara Y', 'Ikeda K', 'Ohto H', 'Kikuta A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210714,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute GVHD', 'albumin', 'biomarker', 'children', 'haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",,2020/12/01 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/11/30 17:14'],"['2020/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/30 17:14 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2021 Sep;63(9):1048-1054. doi: 10.1111/ped.14564.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the BME have been shown to contribute immensely to leukemogenesis and chemotherapy resistance in AML cells. However, the mechanism of stroma-induced chemotherapy resistance is not known. Here, we hypothesized that stromal cells promote a stem-like phenotype in AML cells, thereby inducing tumorigenecity and therapy resistance. To test our hypothesis, we co-cultured AML cell lines and patient samples with BM-derived MSCs and determined aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and performed gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing. We found that the percentage of ALDH+ cells increased dramatically when AML cells were co-cultured with MSCs. However, among the 19 ALDH isoforms, ALDH2 and ALDH1L2 were the only two that were significantly upregulated in AML cells co-cultured with stromal cells compared to cells cultured alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-regulated gene signature is activated in AML cells co-cultured with MSCs. Knockdown of TGF-beta1 in BM-MSCs inhibited stroma-induced ALDH activity and ALDH2 expression in AML cells, whereas treatment with recombinant TGF-beta1 induced the ALDH+ phenotype in AML cells. We also found that TGF-beta1-induced ALDH2 expression in AML cells is mediated by the non-canonical pathway through the activation of p38.

Undiagnosed CML in a patient with pre-existing poorly controlled DM is rarely encountered but must be recognized to treat appropriately with systemic chemotherapy. Significant fundus finding overlaps with DM makes the recognition of CML challenging. METHODS: Case Report. PATIENT: A 47-year-old male with history of poorly controlled non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 12.9%) was assessed for new onset of floaters in his right eye. RESULTS: Fundoscopy revealed scattered dot-blot hemorrhages, venous beading and numerous Roth spots in all quadrants, in both eyes. In the right eye, there was also a vitreous hemorrhage with evidence of neovascularization near the inferior arcade. Intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) showed significant peripheral capillary non perfusion without evidence of exudation in both eyes. No macular edema was observed on OCT. Review of systems and physical exam was negative for constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and other symptoms. Retinal findings prompted a complete blood count, which revealed significant leukocytosis. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of CML. Systemic chemotherapy and pan-retinal photocoagulation successfully normalized the leukocyte count and resolved the vitreous hemorrhage and neovascularization. CONCLUSION: The presence of numerous Roth spots in all quadrants, extensive areas of capillary non-perfusion on IVFA and neovascularization in the absence of exudation or macular edema should prompt investigations to rule out hematologic disorders.",,"['Al Falah, Mohammed', 'Ballios, Brian G', 'Yeung, Shanna C', 'Far, Parsa Mehraban', 'Yan, Peng']","['Al Falah M', 'Ballios BG', 'Yeung SC', 'Far PM', 'Yan P']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'College of Medicine, King Faisal University, Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', ""Department of Ophthalmology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Kensington Vision and Research Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201120,United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,,,,,2020/12/01 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/11/30 12:10'],"['2020/11/30 12:10 [entrez]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']",aheadofprint,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2020 Nov 20. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000001100.,,10.1097/ICB.0000000000001100 [doi],,IM,,['10.1097/ICB.0000000000001100 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obinutuzumab was developed to potentiate activity and overcome resistance to rituximab. Clinical data suggest that obinutuzumab is superior to rituximab in follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Yet, it has increased toxicity. This systematic review and meta-analysis compiled all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing obinutuzumab-based regimens with rituximab-based regimens to better assess their toxicity profile. Primary outcome was grade 3-4 infections; secondary outcomes included any adverse events (AE), grade 3-4 AE, drug discontinuation rate, and 3-years mortality. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated and pooled using a fixed-effect model, unless there was significant heterogeneity, in which case a random-effects model was used. Our comprehensive search yielded five RCTs conducted between 2009 and 2014, including 4247 patients. The trials included FL patients, CLL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies were given with different chemotherapy regimens (in four trials) or as monotherapy (in one trial). The point estimate favored increase in both grade 3-4 infections rate (RR 1.17 [95% CI, 1.0-1.36]) and any AE rate (RR 1.05 [95% 1-1.1]) with obinutuzumab, although this was not statistically significant. There was a significantly increased rate of grade 3-4 AE (RR 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.2]), as well as grade 3-4 toxicities including thrombocytopenia (RR 2.8 [95% CI, 1.92-4.06]), infusion related reactions (RR 2.8 [95% CI, 2.16-3.64]) and cardiac events (RR 1.65 [95% CI, 1.11-2.46]). There was no significant difference in grade 3-4 anemia and neutropenia nor in the 3-year mortality rate. The point estimate favored increase in discontinuation rate due to AE with obinutuzumab, although without statistical significance (RR 1.24 [95% CI, 1.0-1.54]).

Subsequently, more expensive second-generation TKIs with varying selectivity profiles have been approved. Population-based studies are needed to evaluate the real-world utilization of TKI therapies, particularly given their escalating costs and recommendations for maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the utilization patterns of first-line TKIs, overall and by specific agent, among elderly CML patients in the United States, and the cost implications. METHODS: CML patients aged 65 years and older at diagnosis between 2007 and 2015 were identified from population-based cancer registries in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. The percentage of CML patients receiving imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib within the first year of diagnosis was calculated along with time to first-line treatment initiation. Bivariate comparisons and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with TKI initiation. Average monthly patient responsibility, including patient out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, stratified by Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) status were also calculated. RESULTS: Among the 1,589 CML patients included, receipt of any TKI within 1 year of diagnosis increased from 66.2% to 78.9%. In 2015, the distribution of first-line TKI therapies was 41.3% imatinib, 28.3% dasatinib, and 9.3% nilotinib. Almost 60% of patients initiated TKI treatment within 3 months of diagnosis. Multivariable analysis indicated that TKI use in the first year was lower among the very elderly (aged > 75 years vs. 65-69 years: HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.63-0.83), patients with more comorbidities (Hierarchical Condition Category risk score > 2 vs. HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.88), and patients ineligible for LIS (HR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.65-0.87). Average monthly patient OOP cost was significantly lower for LIS-eligible versus LIS-ineligible patients: imatinib (2016: $12 vs. $487), dasatinib (2016: $34 vs. $557), and nilotinib (2016: $1 vs. $526). CONCLUSIONS: TKI use has increased significantly since 2007. While imatinib remained the most frequently prescribed first-line agent, by 2015 newer TKIs represented one third of the market share. Utilization patterns indicated persistent age, comorbidity, and financial barriers. TKI use is indicated for long-term therapy, and increased adoption of newer, more expensive agents raises concerns about the sustained affordability of CML treatment, particularly among unsubsidized patients.

In China, little is known about parental experiences of having a young child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This phenomenological study aimed to describe parental experiences of having a young child with ALL in China. METHOD: Ten parents, recruited in central China using purposive sampling, participated in face-to-face, in-depth interviews using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method. RESULTS: Five theme categories were identified: (a) The Cancer Diagnosis as a Terrible Disaster-The Sky is Falling, (b) Fighting the Beast, (c) Putting on a Happy Face and Other Coping Strategies, (d) Diagnosis Disclosure: If We Tell and How to Tell, and (e) Hope-Filled Expectations: Returning to Normal Life. CONCLUSION: Parents put their child's health as their top priority. They strive to manage uncertainty about prognosis and cope with enormous pressures caused by children's suffering, financial burden, and stigma. Parents also express their resilience and hope throughout their child's cancer journey. Support services to strengthen specific families' protective factors (i.e., family/community support, hope, and positive coping) are needed to foster resilience and quality of life. Health care professionals should systematically assess parents' needs, provide validated education materials, and implement tailored interventions across the cancer continuum. Public education and advocacy about cancer is also necessary to decrease cancer-related stigma, and provide financial aid and health care resources in pediatric oncology.",,"['Liu, Qian', 'Petrini, Marcia A', 'Luo, Dan', 'Yang, Bing Xiang', 'Yang, Jiong', 'Haase, Joan E']","['Liu Q', 'Petrini MA', 'Luo D', 'Yang BX', 'Yang J', 'Haase JE']","['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 89674Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Health Sciences, 12390Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '26682Faculty of Nursing Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'School of Health Sciences, 12390Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Health Sciences, 12390Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 89674Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Nursing, 10668Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201130,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,['NOTNLM'],"['China', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer', 'children', 'parents']",,2020/12/01 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2020/11/30 08:41'],"['2020/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/30 08:41 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2021 Mar-Apr;38(2):94-104. doi: 10.1177/1043454220975463.

Therefore, the majority of CML treatments are bcr-abl specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). TKI resistance in CML treatment is becoming a major obstacle in managing this disease. One well-studied form of drug resistance is hypoxia-induced drug resistance, a phenomenon observed in many other cancers. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of TKIs in CML cells cultured in hypoxia. It was observed that bcr-abl translation was severely halted in hypoxia, rendering TKIs ineffective. We found that the mechanism by which bcr-abl protein levels were being suppressed in hypoxia was through the mTOR pathway, specifically via ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6).

The onset and subsequent progression of CML is well-described in humans. There is comparably little information surrounding CML progression in veterinary species, including Yucatan miniature swine that are common for preclinical pharmaceutical and device testing. In humans, more than 90% of CML cases are associated with a chromosomal translocation that results in the Philadelphia gene (BCR/ABL mutation). In this report, the presence of the Philadelphia gene in a Yucatan burrow was confirmed in white blood cells collected prior to onset of clinical signs with primers designed from the human BCR/ABL sequence. Case Presentation: A 24 month old, 70 kg, Yucatan barrow received a prefabricated bovine cortical bone xenograft following a unilateral zygomatic ostectomy for a preclinical study. Complete blood count and serum chemistries were performed prior to and 28, 53, 106, and 129 days after facial surgery. Fifty three days after surgery, a bone marrow biopsy was performed due to anorexia, severe basophilia, and mild anemia. A finding of a moderate increase in basophilic precursors in bone marrow cytology was followed by lymphocyte immunophenotyping via flow cytometry and RT-PCR amplification of the Philadelphia gene in white blood cell samples from the affected barrow and an unaffected barrow in the same treatment group. Bone marrow, lymph node, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and adrenal gland lesions of mostly myeloblasts were identified after the affected barrow died 146 days after surgery. Flow cytometry confirmed lymphopenia and suggested basophilia, and RT-PCR established the presence of the BCR/ABL gene. Conclusions: The information in this report confirms the presence of the BCR/ABL mutation and documents progression of chronic myelogenous (basophilic) leukemia from a chronic phase to a terminal blast crisis in an adult Yucatan barrow. The natural occurrence and progression of CML associated with the BCR/ABL mutation in miniature swine establishes potential for future porcine models of human CML. The information also establishes a genetic test to confirm porcine CML to prevent inadvertent attribution of clinical signs to treatment complications during preclinical testing.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Takawira, Arsuaga-Zorrilla, Wilson, Taguchi, Dietrich, Stout', 'and Lopez.']","['Takawira, Catherine', 'Arsuaga-Zorrilla, Carmen B', 'Wilson, Leslie', 'Taguchi, Takashi', 'Dietrich, Marilyn A', 'Stout, Rhett W', 'Lopez, Mandi J']","['Takawira C', 'Arsuaga-Zorrilla CB', 'Wilson L', 'Taguchi T', 'Dietrich MA', 'Stout RW', 'Lopez MJ']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201105,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,PMC7674400,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome', 'bone marrow', 'cancer', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'gene', 'hematologic malignancy', 'pig']",,2020/12/01 06:00,2020/12/01 06:01,['2020/11/30 05:55'],"['2020/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/30 05:55 [entrez]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2020 Nov 5;7:575199. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2020.575199. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fvets.2020.575199 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fvets.2020.575199 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss-of-function mutations in PHF6, encoding a presumed epigenetic regulator, have been primarily described in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and the first insights into its function in normal hematopoiesis only recently emerged from mouse modeling experiments. Here, we investigated the role of PHF6 in human blood cell development by performing knockdown studies in cord blood and thymus-derived hematopoietic precursors to evaluate the impact on lineage differentiation in well-established in vitro models. Our findings reveal that PHF6 levels differentially impact the differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells into various blood cell lineages, with prominent effects on lymphoid and erythroid differentiation. We show that loss of PHF6 results in accelerated human T cell development through reduced expression of NOTCH1 and its downstream target genes. This functional interaction in developing thymocytes was confirmed in vivo using a phf6-deficient zebrafish model that also displayed accelerated developmental kinetics upon reduced phf6 or notch1 activation. In summary, our work reveals that appropriate control of PHF6 expression is important for normal human hematopoiesis and provides clues towards the role of PHF6 in T-ALL development.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Loontiens, Dolens, Strubbe, Van de Walle, Moore, Depestel,', 'Vanhauwaert, Matthijssens, Langenau, Speleman, Van Vlierberghe, Durinck and', 'Taghon.']","['Loontiens, Siebe', 'Dolens, Anne-Catherine', 'Strubbe, Steven', 'Van de Walle, Inge', 'Moore, Finola E', 'Depestel, Lisa', 'Vanhauwaert, Suzanne', 'Matthijssens, Filip', 'Langenau, David M', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Durinck, Kaat', 'Taghon, Tom']","['Loontiens S', 'Dolens AC', 'Strubbe S', 'Van de Walle I', 'Moore FE', 'Depestel L', 'Vanhauwaert S', 'Matthijssens F', 'Langenau DM', 'Speleman F', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Durinck K', 'Taghon T']","['Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Molecular Pathology and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Molecular Pathology and Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA, United States.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201104,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,PMC7672048,['NOTNLM'],"['NOTCH', 'PHF6', 'T cell development', 'hematopoiesis', 'zebrafish']",,2020/12/01 06:00,2020/12/01 06:01,['2020/11/30 05:55'],"['2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/30 05:55 [entrez]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Nov 4;8:599472. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.599472. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fcell.2020.599472 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fcell.2020.599472 [doi]'],,,,['R01 CA211734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment of lymphomas of B-cell origin, relapsed and refractory disease represents an unmet clinical need. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to better understand the lymphomas' intrinsic features as well as the interactions with their cellular microenvironment for developing novel therapeutic strategies. In fact, the role of immune-based approaches is steadily increasing and involves amongst others the use of monoclonal antibodies against tumor antigens, inhibitors of immunological checkpoints, and even genetically modified T-cells. Metabolic reprogramming and immune escape both represent well established cancer hallmarks. Tumor metabolism as introduced by Otto Warburg in the early 20th century promotes survival, proliferation, and therapeutic resistance. Simultaneously, malignant cells employ a plethora of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance. Increasing evidence suggests that metabolic reprogramming does not only confer cell intrinsic growth and survival advantages to tumor cells but also impacts local as well as systemic anti-tumor immunity. Tumor and immune cells compete over nutrients such as carbohydrates or amino acids that are critical for the immune cell function. Moreover, skewed metabolic pathways in malignant cells can result in abundant production and release of bioactive metabolites such as lactic acid, kynurenine or reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect immune cell fitness and function. This ""metabolic re-modeling"" of the tumor microenvironment shifts anti-tumor immune reactivity toward tolerance. Here, we will review molecular events leading to metabolic alterations in B-cell lymphomas and their impact on anti-tumor immunity.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Bottcher, Baur, Stoll, Mackensen and Mougiakakos.']","['Bottcher, Martin', 'Baur, Rebecca', 'Stoll, Andrej', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Bottcher M', 'Baur R', 'Stoll A', 'Mackensen A', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201105,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7674840,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell-derived Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immune escape', 'immune therapeutics', 'metabolism']",,2020/12/01 06:00,2020/12/01 06:01,['2020/11/30 05:54'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/30 05:54 [entrez]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 5;10:594782. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.594782. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.594782 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.594782 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most target antigens are also expressed on normal tissues at varying levels, and therefore, a considerable challenge in the field is determining safety profiles, including life-threatening off-tumor and off-target toxicities. The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (hGMR) is a promising target for CAR T-cell therapy for a subset of acute myelocytic leukaemia, although it is also expressed on normal cells including monocytes, macrophages, CD34-positive haematopoietic cells and vascular endothelial cells. hGMR and other immune-related proteins are highly conserved between humans and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Therefore, in this study, we engineered cynomolgus T cells to express CAR molecules redirected to hGMR by piggyBac (PB) transposon-based gene transfer and adoptively transferred autologous hGMR-CAR T cells into cynomolgus macaques. Methods: We established PB-mediated human GMR (hGMR)-specific CAR T cells using cynomolgus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and transferred them into autologous individuals, and evaluated the potential toxicity related to hGMR-CAR T cells. Results: hGMR-CAR T cells did not exert overt organ toxicities such as bone marrow suppression, monocytopenia and vasculitis, although they recognised and killed cynomolgus monocytes and macrophages in vitro. Conclusion: Although our model did not simulate a tumor-bearing model, it supports the safety of hGMR-CAR T cells and demonstrates the usefulness of a non-human primate model to evaluate the safety of T-cell products by assessing off-tumor/off-target toxicity before clinical trials.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Chemical investigation of the former fungal extracts yielded 11 new lactam derivatives, aplosporellins A-K (2-12), in addition to the known compound, pramanicin A (1). All of these compounds were not detected when the fungus was grown on rice medium without these activators thereby indicating the power of this OSMAC approach. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by one- and two- dimensional NMR spectroscopy, DFT-NMR calculations and by mass spectrometry as well as by comparison with the literature whereas the absolute configuration of the lactam core was determined by TDDFT-ECD and OR calculations. Pramanicin A (1) showed strong cytotoxicity against human lymphoma (Ramos) and leukemia (Jurkat J16) cells with IC50 values of 4.7 and 4.4 muM, respectively.

Increasing data suggest that digital PCR (dPCR) is more accurate and reliable than RT-qPCR in CML minimal residual disease monitoring and in patients' selection for treatment discontinuation. But what about the identification of treatment discontinuation failures? We present the case of a CML patient enrolled both in a study aiming to comparatively assess molecular response by RT-qPCR and dPCR and in the progressive arm of the OPTkIMA trial. This is a phase III trial including CML patients randomized to receive a fixed versus a progressive intermittent tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen. At 24 months, because of two consecutive detections of MR<sup>2.0</sup> by RT-qPCR, the patient resumed daily treatment. Conversely, dPCR revealed a stability of molecular response and even a slight decreasing of transcript over time. An additional specimen was sampled one month after the first MR<sup>2.0</sup> detection because of clinical decision: RT-qPCR resulted MR<sup>3.0</sup> and dPCR confirmed the transcript's stability. Nowadays, the resumption of therapy is RT-qPCR-driven despite its limits in detection and robustness. In this case, according to dPCR, the patient could have continued intermittent treatment and the stability of response was then confirmed by RT-qPCR. So, dPCR could be able to better identify peculiar clinical response to therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by S.

Methods: Clinical characteristics, prognostic impact and the association between ASXL1 mutations and some other mutations were analyzed. Results: We found ASXL1 mutations were most frequently found in M5 subtype and intermediate risk karyotype and were correlated with TET2, DNMT3A and PHF6 mutations. A total of 145 patients were included in prognostic analysis; results showed ASXL1 mutations had no impact on OS and DFS. In normal karyotype-AML (CN-AML) and older (>/=60 years) AML, ASXL1 mutations showed adverse impact on OS (P = 0.022; p = 0.019, respectively) and showed adverse prognostic tendency on DFS (p = 0.173; p = 0.108, respectively). ASXL1 mutations were also independent unfavourable prognostic factors for OS on CN-AML and older (>/=60 years) AML patients and unfavourable factors for DFS on older (>/=60 years) AML in multivariate analysis. Results also indicated that though ASXL1 mutations were associated with TET2, DNMT3A and PHF6 mutations, when coinciding with ASXL1 mutations, the prognosis of AML was not significantly impacted. Discussion: The reliability of our results need to be further confirmed by prospective randomized controlled studies covering a large numbers of AML patients.

All patients were subdivided into negative (n = 96), ""low"" (0.1%-0.5%, n = 32), and ""high"" MRD (>0.5%, n = 61) groups. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, the hazard ratios for ""high"" and ""low"" MRD levels related to MRD negativity were 7.9 (95% CI 3.5-18.1, P < .001) and 5.4 (95% CI 2.1-14, P = .0058) for relapse; 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-4.1, P = .006) and 1.6 (95% CI 0.82-3.3, P = .16) for OS; and 2.8 (95% CI 1.7-4.7, P < .001) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.2, P = .02) for LFS, respectively. We found no significant impact of ""low"" MRD level on relapses (0.68, 95% CI 0.33-1.4, P = .30), OS (0.72, 95% CI: 0.36-1.5, P = .36) and LFS (0.79, 95% CI: 0.42-1.5, P = .46) related to ""high"" MRD group. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of detectable MRD was indicative for a high relapse risk, low LFS and OS.

While transplantation is well recognized to impose severe stress on transplanted cells, the nature of transplant-induced stress remains elusive. Here, we propose that the lack of amino acids in serum is the major cause of transplant-induced stress. Mechanistically, amino acid deficiency decreases protein synthesis and nutrient consummation. However, in cells with overactive AKT and ERK, mTORC1 is not inhibited and protein synthesis remains relatively high. This impaired signaling causes nutrient depletion, cell cycle block, and eventually autophagy and cell death, which can be inhibited by cycloheximide or mTORC1 inhibitors. Thus, mTORC1-mediated amino acid signaling is critical in cell fate determination under transplant-induced stress, and protein synthesis inhibition can improve transplantation efficiency.",['(c) 2020 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Cheng, Xiaoyan', 'Ge, Maolin', 'Zhu, Shouhai', 'Li, Dan', 'Wang, Ruiheng', 'Xu, Qiongyu', 'Chen, Zhihong', 'Xie, Shufeng', 'Liu, Han']","['Cheng X', 'Ge M', 'Zhu S', 'Li D', 'Wang R', 'Xu Q', 'Chen Z', 'Xie S', 'Liu H']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201208,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,['NOTNLM'],"['*amino acid', '*leukemia', '*mTORC1', '*metabolism', '*transplant-induced stress']",,2020/11/30 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/11/29 20:36'],"['2020/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/29 20:36 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2021 Feb;595(4):462-475. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.14008.

Among them, lncRNA KIAA0125 is one of the genes proposed to play a critical role in leukaemia stem cell (LSC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of the expression levels of lncRNA KIAA0125 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a disease with highly heterogeneous clinical and biological features. Using RNA arrays, we measured the expression of KIAA0125 in 176 primary MDS patients. We found that higher KIAA0125 expression was associated with higher risk MDS, based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), mutations in ASXL1 and NRAS, and predicted poorer overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher KIAA0125 expression was an independent, unfavourable prognostic factor for OS and LFS, irrespective of IPSS-R and mutation status. Further global gene expression profile analysis suggested a close association of higher KIAA0125 expressions with LSC signatures. The expression of KIAA0125 may be a potential biomarker to guide the treatment choice in MDS patients, especially those with lower risk subtypes, in whom palliative treatment is usually used.",['(c) 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Hung, Sheng-Yu', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Hsu, Chia-Lang', 'Yao, Chi-Yuan', 'Wang, Yu-Hung', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Hung SY', 'Lin CC', 'Hsu CL', 'Yao CY', 'Wang YH', 'Tsai CH', 'Hou HA', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, Yunlin, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201129,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,,,,2020/11/30 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/11/29 20:36'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/29 20:36 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Feb;192(3):589-598. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17231.

This study describes the potential of a paper-based sensor array for detecting leukemia using blood VOCs. Blood samples were collected from 59 new leukemia cases and 47 healthy cases as a control group. Each blood sample was divided into two parts; one for a laboratory test and the other was used in our study. Samples were mixed with heparin and then transferred to a sterile container, and a sensor was stacked on its cap. This sensor array contains 16 nanoparticles deposited on a sheet of hydrophobic paper in a 4 x 4 array format. Containers were stored in an oven at 60 degrees C for 4.5 h. Then, the image of sensors was recorded by a scanner and compared to the image before exposing the blood vapor. The sensor responses were subjected to different multivariate statistical methods to develop models that discriminate between control and leukemia samples. The interaction of nanoparticles with the volatile metabolome of blood caused aggregation and consequently changing in the color of nanoparticles. The color changes resulted in a specific pattern for blood samples with leukemia, which is different from those obtained from healthy specimens. The discrimination analysis was approved by pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis with 97% accuracy. Among 59 patients, the mean age was 6.02 +/- 4.55 years (range 1-16 y). The mean total response was 652.83 +/- 117.02. The rock curve showed an accuracy of 96% for classifying patients from the control group. The logistic regression model showed that 93.6% of healthy and 93.2% of patients were classified correctly by using this method. These statistics agree with the classification results obtained by principal component analysis. For every 5000-unit increase in platelet count, the chance of leukemia decreased by 9%. Additionally, the chance of being categorized as a patient decreased by 10% for every 20-unit increase in total response. The electronic nose using VOC's of blood is a non-invasive and inexpensive tool for detecting new cases of leukemia with high sensitivity and specificity. Platelet count is an essential para-clinical parameter determining the total response of the sensors. Follow up studies with a larger sample size are warranted to elucidate its clinical applicability.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand thrombogenic mechanisms during induction treatment, we studied the number, origin and procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and P-selectin level throughout the induction course in 24 paediatric patients. EVs were mainly of platelet origin. We observed a significant increase in EV number, in platelet EV number and P-selectin level throughout the induction course. There was a correlation between higher EV and platelet EV number, P-selectin level, higher platelet count and leucocyte count. We also observed a correlation between higher EV procoagulant activity and higher platelet count and leucocyte count and higher P-selectin level. Older age and T phenotype were associated with a higher EV procoagulant activity.

Deregulation of microRNA may contribute to hematopoietic malignancies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of miR-181a and miR-196b in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and correlate their expression with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS: The study was performed on bone marrow samples of 70 consecutive newly diagnosed pediatric (ALL) patients, of which 56 were evaluated for both miR-181a and miR-196b (all 70 for miR-181a) by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, bone marrow from seven age and sex matched healthy controls derived from donors of bone marrow transplantation were assessed. RESULTS: miR-181a expression was significantly up-regulated in ALL patients compared with healthy controls (p <0.001). However, miR-196b expression was significantly down-regulated in patients compared with healthy controls (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-181a has an oncogenic, while miR-196b has a tumor suppressive role in pediatric ALL patients. A finding which demonstrate the potential role of these microRNAs in pathogenesis of pediatric ALL. Also, estimation of their expression level may provide a tool for confirmation of a diagnosis of childhood ALL and could be a possible predictor of early relapse.<br />.",,"['Shafik, Roxan Ezzat', 'Abd El Wahab, Nahed', 'Mokhtar, Marwa M', 'El Taweel, Maha A', 'Ebeid, Emad']","['Shafik RE', 'Abd El Wahab N', 'Mokhtar MM', 'El Taweel MA', 'Ebeid E']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, NCI, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, NCI, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, NCI, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, NCI, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, NCI, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201101,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8033117,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Pediatric', 'microRNA-181a', 'microRNA-196b']",,2020/11/29 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/11/28 11:19'],"['2019/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 11:19 [entrez]', '2020/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Nov 1;21(11):3429-3434. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3429.,20210802,89368 [pii] 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3429 [doi],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN196 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3429 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The analysis was based on de-identified data of 263 childhood cancer for the period 2002 to 2017 retrieved from a population-based cancer registry. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis, using the log-rank test, was used to examine the differences in survival between groups. Multivariate analysis, using the Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) regression model, was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and select the significant associated factors for childhood cancer patients' survival. RESULTS: The overall 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates for all childhood cancers combined were 79.4%, 70.0% and 68.8% respectively. The most common types of cancer were leukemias, malignant epithelial neoplasms, lymphomas and tumours of the central nervous system (CNS). The 5-year survival estimates were highest for malignant epithelial neoplasms (84.2%) while the lowest was tumours of the CNS (44.1%). Log rank tests showed significant differences in childhood cancer patients' survival between tumour types and period of diagnosis. In the Cox PH analysis, the presence of lymphomas, gonodal and germ cell neoplasms, and malignant epithelial neoplasms compared to leukemia; children aged 1-4 and 5-9 years compared to adolescents aged 15-19 years; and periods of diagnosis in 2002-2006 and 2007-2011 compared to 2012-2017 were significantly associated with lower hazard of death in this study. CONCLUSION: This study provides a baseline measurement of childhood cancer survival for monitoring and evaluation of cancer control programmes, to allow planning of cancer control program strategies such as surveillance, screening, and treatment to improve childhood survival rates in Brunei Darussalam.",,"['Leong, Elvynna', 'Ong, Sok King', 'Jali, Fadzilah', 'Ramlee, Noraslinah']","['Leong E', 'Ong SK', 'Jali F', 'Ramlee N']","['Faculty of Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jln Tungku Link, Brunei Darussalam.', 'Institute of Applied Data Analytics, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jln Tungku Link, Brunei Darussalam.', 'NCD Prevention Unit, Ministry of Health, Commonwealth Drive, Brunei Darussalam.', 'Faculty of Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jln Tungku Link, Brunei Darussalam.', 'Early Detection & Cancer Prevention Services, Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre, Brunei Darussalam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201101,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8033123,['NOTNLM'],"['Cox PH', 'Prognostic factor', 'cancer registry', 'hazard', 'population-based']",,2020/11/29 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/11/28 11:19'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 11:19 [entrez]', '2020/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Nov 1;21(11):3259-3266. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3259.,20210730,89346 [pii] 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3259 [doi],,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brunei', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3259 [doi]'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0728-9762'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SETTINGS: The population of Karachi division is 16.1 million according to national census 2017. 'Karachi Cancer Registry' which is a part of 'National Cancer Registry' is collecting data from eight major hospitals in Karachi since 2017. For outcome measures, cancer counts and the age standardized incidence rates (ASIR) per 100,000 population were computed for age groups (0-14, 15-19 and >/=20 years), in both genders and all cancer site/type. METHODS: The population denominators were based on the population of Karachi division estimated at 16.1 million in the population census, 2017. Counts and age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) were calculated for each of the three age categories. RESULTS: From Jan 2017 till Dec 2019 a total of 33,309 malignant cases were recorded in KCR database comprising 17,490 (52.5%) females and 15,819 (47.5%) males. ASIRs in age groups 0-14, 15-19 and >/= 20 years, among female were 11.5, 2.4 and 223.6 and in males were 17.6, 3.2 and 216.7 respectively. The commonest diagnosis in children, adolescent and adults were (1) among females: children; bone (3.12), leukemia (2.09) brain/CNS (1.26); in adolescents: bone (0.78), brain/CNS (0.27), connective and soft tissue (0.11), in adults: breast cancer (76.07), oral cancer (16.68) and ovary (10.89) respectively, and (2) among males: children; bone (4.56), leukemia (2.79) and brain/CNS (1.88); in adolescent; bone (1.19), brain/CNS (0.31) and leukemia (0.21) and in adults: oral cancer (42.83), liver (16.10) and bone (13.37) respectively.

Due to major improvements in the treatment protocols in the 50-years period, the survivability of this disease has witnessed dramatic rise until this date which is about 90 percent. There are many investigations tending to indicate the efficiency of cranial radiotherapy found out that without that, outcome of the patients did not change and even it improved at some cases. METHODS: the main aim of this study is predicting cranial radiotherapy treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients using machine learning. Scope of this paper is intertwined with predicting the necessity of one of the treatment modalities that has been used for many years for this group of patients named Cranial Radiotherapy (CRT). For this purpose, a case study is considered at Mahak charity hospital. In this paper, our focus is on ALL patients aged 0 to 17 treated at Mahak hospital, one of the best centers for treatment of childhood malignancies in Iran. Dataset analyzed in this study is gathered by the research team from patient's paper-based files. Our dataset consists of 241 observations on patients with 31 attributes after the data cleaning process. Our designed machine learning model for predicting cranial radiotherapy treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients is a stacked ensemble classifier of independently strong models with a meta-learner to tune the weights and parameters of the base classifiers. RESULTS: The stacked ensemble classifier show highly reasonable performance with AUC of 87.52%. Moreover, the attributes are ranked based on their predictive power and the most important variable for CRT necessity prediction is the disease relapse. CONCLUSION: In order to conclude, derived from previous studies regarding CRT it is not only cost-effective but also more healthy to eradicate the use of CRT for the treatment of childhood ALL. Furthermore, it is valuable to increase the clinical databases by creating more synthetic health databases not only for research purposes but also for physicians to keep track of their patient's status. <br />.",,"['Kashef, Amirarash', 'Khatibi, Toktam', 'Mehrvar, Azim']","['Kashef A', 'Khatibi T', 'Mehrvar A']","['School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University (TMU), Tehran, Iran.', 'School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University (TMU), Tehran, Iran.', 'Mahak Hematology Oncology Research Center (Mahak-HORC), Mahak Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'AJA Cancer Epidemiology Research and Treatment Center (AJA-CERTC), AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201101,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8033115,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*Cranial Radiotherapy', '*Stacked ensemble', '*childhood blood cancer', '*prediction']",,2020/11/29 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/11/28 11:19'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/28 11:19 [entrez]', '2020/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Nov 1;21(11):3211-3219. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3211.,20210730,89340 [pii] 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3211 [doi],,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran', '*Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Oncology']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.11.3211 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the association between TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphism and the risk of acquiring severe infections, and impact on AML patient's outcome. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP); we analyzed three SNPs in the TLR2 (Arg753Gln) and TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) in 120 AML patients and 100 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: No significant differences in genotype or alleles frequency between healthy controls and AML patients regarding TLR2 Arg753Gln, TLR4 Asp299Gly and TLR4 Thr399Ile polymorphisms (P>0.05 for all). Neutropenic fever was detected in 110 out of 120 (91.7%) of the studied AML patients. The sepsis and pneumonia were identified in 20 out of 120 patients (16.7%). The incidence of sepsis was associated with TLR2 Arg753Gln: AG genotypes, A allele and TLR4 Asp299Gly: CT genotype and C allele as compared to other genotypes and alleles. Moreover; TLR2 (Arg753Gln) GG polymorphisms significantly associated with shortest overall survival (OS) and shortest disease-free survival (DFS); while TLR4 polymorphisms affect the DSF only but not OS. In AML patients TLR2 Arg753Gln gene polymorphism is associated with high susceptibility to sepsis and TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) gene polymorphism is associated with high susceptibility for both pneumonia; and sepsis. CONCLUSION: TLR2 Arg753Gln (AG; GG genotype) polymorphisms are associated with shortest OS and DFS.

Several oral mucositis (SOM) is one of the most common and may cause undesirable symptoms such as pain and risk of systemic infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal, retrospective, and observational study determining the incidence of severe oral mucositis (SOM) and its occurrence sites in pediatric oncologic patients, in Joao Pessoa, Brazil, between 2013 and 2018. Data from 56 patients aged 1 to 18 years were collected from their medical records and through an oral mucosa examination, from the 1st to 5th week of chemotherapy treatment (CT) using the modified Oral Assessment Guide, by previously calibrated examiners (Kappa index > 0.7). The data were analyzed by the Chi-square test, and Odds Ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Most patients were females (54.5%), aged 8.8 years (+/- 4.8), with hematologic tumors (73.2%), predominantly Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (50.0%). An increase in the occurrence of SOM was observed throughout the CT (P = 0.05), ranging from 12.5% in the 1st to 35.7% in the 5th CT week. In the 1st CT week, there was a predominance of alterations in the lips (5.5%) and saliva (5.5%), while in the 5th, the jugal / palate mucosa (21.4%) remained the most affected site by SOM. Differences in the severity of SOM in the jugal / palate mucosa (P = 0.01) and labial mucosa (P = 0.04) were observed over time. In the 5th CT week, the likelihood of developing SOM was 13.3-fold higher (95% CI: 1.5 - 105.6) in patients with hematologic tumors.

METHODS: All patients treated from February 1999 until September 2019 at our center who had bone marrow biopsy-proven t-MN after PRRT were included. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and all tumor-directed therapies before t-MN diagnosis were collected. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with OS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to define cutoff values as well as sensitivity and specificity of the parameters. RESULTS: Out of 1631 patients treated with PRRT, 30 patients developed t-MN comprising myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 23 patients (77%) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 7 patients (23%). The median OS of t-MN patients was 13 months (range 9.1-16.9 months): 6 months for AML and 15 months for the MDS subgroup, respectively. Higher platelet level was a significant prognostic parameter for longer OS (hazard ratio (HR): 0.99, P < 0.05). Using ROC analysis, the best cutoff value for thrombocyte count was 183.5 Gpt/L, resulting in a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 50%. Other factors, such as hemoglobin level, did not show a significant correlation with OS. CONCLUSION: Even rarely occurred, the OS is gravely compromised in t-MN patients after PRRT, and even less in the AML subgroup (6 months).

Here, we report that SON, a chromosome 21-encoded DNA- and RNA-binding protein, inhibits megakaryocytic differentiation by suppressing RUNX1 and the megakaryocytic gene expression program. As megakaryocytic progenitors differentiate, SON expression is drastically reduced, with mature megakaryocytes having the lowest levels. In contrast, AMKL cells express an aberrantly high level of SON, and knockdown of SON induced the onset of megakaryocytic differentiation in AMKL cell lines. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that SON knockdown turns on the expression of pro-megakaryocytic genes while reducing erythroid gene expression. Mechanistically, SON represses RUNX1 expression by directly binding to the proximal promoter and two enhancer regions, the known +23 kb enhancer and the novel +139 kb enhancer, at the RUNX1 locus to suppress H3K4 methylation. In addition, SON represses the expression of the AP-1 complex subunits JUN, JUNB, and FOSB which are required for late megakaryocytic gene expression. Our findings define SON as a negative regulator of RUNX1 and megakaryocytic differentiation, implicating SON overexpression in impaired differentiation during AMKL development.","['(c) 2020.

Down syndrome acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS-ALL) is characterized by high frequency of CRLF2-rearrangements, JAK2-mutations, or RAS-pathway mutations. Intriguingly, JAK2 and RAS-mutations are mutually exclusive in leukemic sub-clones, causing dichotomy in therapeutic target choices. We prove in a cell model that elevated CRLF2 in combination with constitutionally active JAK2 is sufficient to activate wtRAS. On primary clinical DS-ALL samples, we show that wtRAS-activation is an obligatory consequence of mutated/hyperphosphorylated JAK2. We further prove that CRLF2-ligand TSLP boosts the direct binding of active PTPN11 to wtRAS, providing the molecular mechanism for the wtRAS activation. Pre-inhibition of RAS or PTPN11, but not of PI3K or JAK-signaling, prevented TSLP-induced RAS-GTP boost. Cytotoxicity assays on primary clinical DS-ALL samples demonstrated that, regardless of mutation status, high-risk leukemic cells could only be killed using RAS-inhibitor or PTPN11-inhibitor, but not PI3K/JAK-inhibitors, suggesting a unified treatment target for up to 80% of DS-ALL. Importantly, protein activities-based principal-component-analysis multivariate clusters analyzed for independent outcome prediction using Cox proportional-hazards model showed that protein-activity (but not mutation-status) was independently predictive of outcome, demanding a paradigm-shift in patient-stratification strategy for precision therapy in high-risk ALL.",,"['Koschut, David', 'Ray, Debleena', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Giarin, Emanuela', 'Groet, Jurgen', 'Alic, Ivan', 'Kham, Shirley Kow-Yin', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng-Juh', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Nizetic, Dean']","['Koschut D', 'Ray D', 'Li Z', 'Giarin E', 'Groet J', 'Alic I', 'Kham SK', 'Chng WJ', 'Ariffin H', 'Weinstock DM', 'Yeoh AE', 'Basso G', 'Nizetic D']","['Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health (SDB), Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'The Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, Singapore.', 'University of Malaya Medical Centre, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, Singapore.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health (SDB), Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine, Turin, Italy.', 'Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore. d.nizetic@qmul.ac.uk.', 'The Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom. d.nizetic@qmul.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201127,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC7843419,,,,2020/11/29 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/11/28 05:34'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/28 05:34 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Jan;40(4):746-762. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01567-7.

Due to the potential for antigen loss, antigen diminution, lineage switch or development of a secondary or treatment-related malignancy, the phenotype and manifestation of subsequent leukemia may be elusive. We report on two patients with multiply relapsed/refractory B-ALL who, following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, developed myeloid malignancies. In the first case, a myeloid sarcoma developed in a patient with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome. In the second case, two distinct events occurred. The first event represented a donor-derived myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7 in a patient with a prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This patient went on to present with lineage switch of her original B-ALL to ambiguous lineage T/myeloid acute leukemia.

By virtue of these uniquely complex cases, we provide a framework for the evaluation of relapse or evolution of a subsequent malignancy following antigen-targeted immunotherapy.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Two contrasting phenotypic groups can be identified when assessing PVL in peripheral blood of infected cows. A large number of reports point to bovine genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) as one of the key determinants underlying PVL level. However, biological mechanisms driving BLV PVL profiles and infection progression in cattle have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we evaluated whether a set of candidate genes affecting BLV PVL level according to whole genome association studies are differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from phenotypically contrasting groups of BLV-infected cows. During a 10-mo-long sampling scheme, 129 Holstein cows were phenotyped measuring anti-BLV antibody levels, PVL quantification, and white blood cell subpopulation counts. Finally, the expression of 8 genes (BOLA-DRB3, PRRC2A, ABT1, TNF, BAG6, BOLA-A, LY6G5B, and IER3) located within the bovine major histocompatibility complex region harboring whole genome association SNP hits was evaluated in 2 phenotypic groups: high PVL (n = 7) and low PVL (n = 8). The log2 initial fluorescence value (N0) transformed mean expression values for the ABT1 transcription factor were statistically different in high- and low-PVL groups, showing a higher expression of the ABT1 gene in low-PVL cows. The PRRC2A and IER3 genes had a significant positive (correlation coefficient = 0.61) and negative (correlation coefficient = -0.45) correlation with the lymphocyte counts, respectively. Additionally, the relationships between gene expression values and lymphocyte counts were modeled using linear regressions. Lymphocyte levels in infected cows were better explained (coefficient of determination = 0.56) when fitted a multiple linear regression model using both PRRC2A and IER3 expression values as independent variables. The present study showed evidence of differential gene expression between contrasting BLV infection phenotypes. These genes have not been previously related to BLV pathobiology. This valuable information represents a step forward in understanding the BLV biology and the immune response of naturally infected cows under a commercial milk production system. Efforts to elucidate biological mechanisms leading to BLV infection progression in cows are valuable for BLV control programs. Further studies integrating genotypic data, global transcriptome analysis, and BLV progression phenotypes are needed to better understand the BLV-host interaction.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Dairy Science Association.

Overcoming secondary resistance arising due to clonal evolution is still an unmet need and lack of adequate pre-clinical models hampers the identification of underlying mechanisms and testing of alternate treatment strategies. The current study thus aimed to create cellular models to study molecular mechanisms underlying clonal evolution and identify strategies to overcome the secondary drug resistance. Analysis of cell lines derived from three independent cell-based screens revealed the co-evolution specifically of imatinib and HSP90 inhibitor (HSP90i) resistances despite their exposure to a single inhibitor alone. Molecular and biochemical characterization of these cell lines revealed additional cytogenetic abnormalities, differential activation of pro-survival signaling molecules and over expression of ABL kinase and HSP90 genes. Importantly, all the imatinib-HSP90i dual resistant cell lines remained sensitive to sorafenib and vorinostat suggesting their utility in treating patients who relapse upon imatinib treatment due to clonal evolution. In addition, we cite similar examples of dual resistance towards various kinase inhibitors and HSP90i in some cell lines that represent solid cancers suggesting co-evolution leading to secondary drug resistance as a pan-cancer phenomenon. Taken together, our results suggest the efficacy of HSP90i in overcoming drug resistance caused by point mutations in the target kinase but not in cases of clonal evolution.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A sustained and deep molecular response achieved over time paves the way to therapy discontinuation, and is a pre-requisite to attempt treatment-free remission. Monitoring of the molecular response during treatment discontinuation is routinely carried out by RQ-PCR, but it may not be the optimal tool to monitor minimal residual disease at the time of stopping treatment and during treatment discontinuation. Different digital PCR platforms (such as droplet dPCR) are available, a method based on water-emulsion droplet technology in which the sample is partitioned into 20,000 droplets and PCR amplification of the template subsequently occurs in each individual droplet. The consequent high sensitivity and precision with a very reliable quantification without the need of a calibration curve and the exquisite reproducibility makes this procedure as an ideal alternative method for the detection of very low levels of disease. Aim of this review is to describe and discuss the recent use of dPCR/ddPCR in CML, focusing in particular on its role in TKI treatment discontinuation strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Over 400 bioactive constituents, including more than 100 phytocannabinoids, have been isolated from this plant. The non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) and the psychoactive Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) are the major and widely studied constituents from this plant. Cannabinoids exert their effects through the endocannabinoid system (ECS) that comprises cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2), endogenous ligands, and metabolizing enzymes. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of cannabinoids against leukemia, lymphoma, glioblastoma, and cancers of the breast, colorectum, pancreas, cervix and prostate. Cannabis and its constituents can modulate multiple cancer related pathways such as PKB, AMPK, CAMKK-beta, mTOR, PDHK, HIF-1alpha, and PPAR-gamma. Cannabinoids can block cell growth, progression of cell cycle and induce apoptosis selectively in tumour cells. Cannabinoids can also enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. These compounds have been used for the management of anorexia, queasiness, and pain in cancer patients. Cannabinoid based products such as dronabinol, nabilone, nabiximols, and epidyolex are now approved for medical use in cancer patients. Cannabinoids are reported to produce a favourable safety profile. However, psychoactive properties and poor bioavailability limit the use of some cannabinoids.

However, its delayed-intensification (DI) phase, comprising repeated blocks of protocol III (2003-PIII), was toxic and caused significant treatment delays. The successor MS2010 study attempted to lower DI toxicity by replacing myelosuppressive drugs (doxorubicin, cytarabine) with vincristine and asparaginase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 1748 admissions for fever in 315 Singapore children with non-HR acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (MS2003, n = 183; MS2010, n = 132), comprising 76% of the total cohort (n = 413), to study the impact of these changes. RESULTS: The new 2010-PVa which has no doxorubicin, was associated with significantly fewer hospitalisations due to fever (0.08 versus 0.30 admissions per block [A/blk], p < 0.001), as than 2003-PIIIa. Similarly in 2010-PIIIb and PVb, where one block of cytarabine was replaced by two doses of vincristine, admissions for fever were also fewer (0.47 versus 0.74 A/blk, p < 0.001) than in 2003-PIIIb. However, the addition of single doses of vincristine and asparaginase in 2010-PIIIa, even with a mandatory seven-day rest, led to more hospitalisations (0.45 A/blk, p < 0.001), increased risk of bacteraemia (relative-risk (RR) = 7.66, p = 0.005) and critical-care admissions (RR = 4.31, p = 0.13). Despite this, overall treatment-related mortality decreased from 2.7% to 0.8%. Taken together, the reduced phase delays allowed earlier completion of the intensive phase of treatment (standard risk: 38.1 versus 49.4 weeks, p < 0.001; intermediate risk: 50.9 versus 58.8 weeks, p < 0.001), while maintaining excellent 10-year event-free survival of 95.4% and overall survival of 96.2%.

The cytotoxicity, SCHL-induced autophagic, ferroptotic, and necroptotic cell death were evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay (RRA). Caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activity of caspases using spectrophotometric analysis. Flow cytometry was applied for cell cycle analysis (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA). SCHL and doxorubicin (reference molecule) exhibited cytotoxic effects towards the 18 cancer cell lines tested. The IC50 values obtained ranged from 3.64 muM (towards CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 16.86 muM (against the BRAF-wildtype SKMel-505 melanoma cells for SCHL). Collateral sensitivity of the resistant HCT116 p53(-/-) colon adenocarcinoma cells to SCHL was observed as well as the normal sensitivity of CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, MDA-MB-231-BCRP breast adenocarcinoma cells and U87. MGDeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells. SCHL induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via caspases 3/7-, 8- and 9-activation, MMP alteration and increased ROS production, and otherwise ferroptosis and necroptosis.

Nevertheless, its specific mechanism in driving drug-resistance remains unclear. We present evidence that S70pBcl2 promotes cancer cell survival by acting as a redox sensor and modulator to prevent oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and execution. Increased S70pBcl2 levels are inversely correlated with DNA damage in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma patient-derived primary cells as well as in reactive oxygen species (ROS)- or chemotherapeutic drug-treated cell lines. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that S70pBcl2 is associated with lower median overall survival in lymphoma patients. Empirically, sustained expression of the redox-sensitive S70pBcl2 prevents oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and cell death by suppressing mitochondrial ROS production. Using cell lines and lymphoma primary cells, we further demonstrate that S70pBcl2 reduces the interaction of Bcl-2 with the mitochondrial complex-IV subunit-5A, thereby reducing mitochondrial complex-IV activity, respiration and ROS production. Notably, targeting S70pBcl2 with the phosphatase activator, FTY720, is accompanied by an enhanced drug-induced DNA damage and cell death in CLL primary cells. Collectively, we provide a novel facet of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 by demonstrating that its phosphorylation at serine-70 functions as a redox sensor to prevent drug-induced oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage and execution with potential therapeutic implications.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Materials & methods: We screened all SNPs in 130 pre-miRNA genes to assess their role in the susceptibility of the most common subtypes of ALL: hyperdiploid and ETV6-RUNX1. Results: In two independent cohorts, we found a significant association between rs10406069 in miR-5196 and the risk of developing hyperdiploid ALL. This observation could be explained by the impact of the SNP on miR-5196 expression and in turn, in its target genes.

Therefore, it is tightly controlled at multiple levels. An advancement in quantitative techniques, mainly over the last decade, shed new light on the regulation of protein production, which pointed the ribosome as a new player. Ribosomes are macromolecular machines that synthesize polypeptide chains using mRNA as a template. The enormous complexity of ribosomes provides many possibilities of changes in their composition and consecutively in their target specificity. However, it is not clear how this specialization is enforced by the cell and which stimuli provoke that diversity.

Clinically, AL is very difficult to cure due to its sudden onset and short course of disease progression. Previous studies have shown that eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) plays a critical role in the development of chronic leukemia. However, the involvement of eIF4B in human acute leukemia is still largely unknown. Therefore, we studied eIF4B function and its regulatory mechanism in human acute leukemia. We found that phosphorylation levels of eIF4B in acute leukemia cells were significantly reduced in response to treatment with either LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), AKTi (AKT inhibitor) or SMI-4A (Pim inhibitor). Co-treatment with inhibitors targeting JAK/STAT5/Pim and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling dramatically promoted apoptosis of acute leukemia cells by downregulating eIF4B phosphorylation. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo functional experiments showed that eIF4B played an important anti-apoptosis role in the acute leukemia cells by regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. In contrast, silencing eIF4B inhibited the growth of acute leukemia cells as engrafted tumors in nude mice. Taken together, our results indicate the synergistic role of JAK/STAT5/Pim and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in regulating eIF4B phosphorylation in acute leukemia, and highlight eIF4B as a candidate therapeutic target for treatment of acute leukemia.",,"['Ma, Yun', 'Li, Tingting', 'Feng, Riyue', 'Guo, Guijie', 'Pan, Qidong', 'Li, Jianning', 'Chen, Jilong']","['Ma Y', 'Li T', 'Feng R', 'Guo G', 'Pan Q', 'Li J', 'Chen J']","['Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,9426463,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK/STAT5/Pim', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR', 'acute leukemia', 'eIF4B']",,2020/11/28 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/11/27 05:50'],"['2020/11/27 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao. 2020 Nov 25;36(11):2413-2423. doi: 10.13345/j.cjb.200015.,20201221,10.13345/j.cjb.200015 [doi],"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",['10.13345/j.cjb.200015 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this combination is unavailable in Japan because rituximab is not approved for CLL. We investigated the efficacy and safety of FCR in this single-arm, multicenter study designed as a bridging study to the CLL8 study by the German CLL Study Group. METHODS: The study enrolled previously untreated patients with CLL of Binet stage B or C with active disease. Patients with a Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score of </=6 and creatinine clearance of >/=70 ml/min were eligible. Patients received 6 cycles of FCR every 28 days and were followed for up to 1 year. RESULTS: Seven patients were enrolled. The best overall response rate according to the 1996 NCI-WG Guidelines, the primary endpoint of the study, was 71.4% (95% confidence interval, 29.0-96.3%), with one patient achieving complete response. No deaths or progression occurred during follow-up. The main adverse event was hematotoxicity. CD4-positive T-cell count decreased in all patients; most patients showed no reduction in serum immunoglobulin G. CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients was limited, FCR appears to be effective with manageable toxicity for treatment-naive fit Japanese patients with CD20-positive CLL.

Patients with low and intermediate Sokal score had better 2-year FFS compared to those with high Sokal Score (p = 0.02).

Thus, identifying the cells responsible for residual disease and leukemia re-growth is critical to better understanding how they are regulated. Here, we show that a knock-in reporter mouse for the stem cell gene Musashi 2 (Msi2) allows identification of leukemia stem cells in aggressive myeloid malignancies, and provides a strategy for defining their core dependencies. Specifically, we carry out a high throughput screen using Msi2-reporter blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML) and identify several adhesion molecules that are preferentially expressed in therapy resistant bcCML cells and play a key role in bcCML. In particular, we focus on syndecan-1, whose deletion triggers defects in bcCML growth and propagation and markedly improves survival of transplanted mice. Further, live imaging reveals that the spatiotemporal dynamics of leukemia cells are critically dependent on syndecan signaling, as loss of this signal impairs their localization, migration and dissemination to distant sites. Finally, at a molecular level, syndecan loss directly impairs integrin beta7 function, suggesting that syndecan exerts its influence, at least in part, by coordinating integrin activity in bcCML. These data present a platform for delineating the biological underpinnings of leukemia stem cell function, and highlight the Sdc1-Itgbeta7 signaling axis as a key regulatory control point for bcCML

METHODS: We examined the immunophenotypes of 109 patients with AML using BD FACSCalibur flow cytometry and analyzed the association of the immunophenotypes and expressions of non-myeloid differentiation antigens with the prognosis and complete remission (CR) rate of the patients. RESULTS: Immunophenotype analysis showed that the positivity rates of the myeloid differentiation antigens of AML cells decreased in the order of CD13, CD117, CD33, MPO and CD15; the positivity rates of CD117, CD13, CD33 and MPO did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) and were all significantly higher than that of CD15 (P < 0.05). The positivity rates of AML cell non-lineage antigens CD34, CD38, HLA-DR, and CD123 did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). The positivity rates of non-myeloid differentiation antigens decreased in the order of CD9, CD200, CD56 and CD7 in AML cells and were all significantly higher than those of CD25, CD19, CD2, CD10, CD4, CyCD79a and CyCD3 (P < 0.05). Among the 109 AML patients, the CR rates of patients positive for CD7, CD34, CD56 and CD25 were significantly lower than those negative for these antigens (P < 0.05); the CR rates were significantly higher in patients positive for MPO and CD19 than in the negative patients (P < 0.05). Among the 15 AML-M2b patients with AML1-ETO positivity, the CR rate following a single treatment course was significantly lower in patients positive for CD56 than in CD56-negative patients, and CD56-positive patients also had a significantly higher relapse rate within 1 year (P < 0.05).

METHODS: The genomic DNA extracted from the bone marrow of 158 patients with newly diagnosed AML for PCR amplification of RUNX1 gene and sequence analysis to identify the mutations. The mutations of ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2, FLT3, CEBPA, NPM1, IDH2, NRAS and c-KIT genes were also examined to analyze their association with RUNX1 gene mutations. RESULTS: Among the 158 AML patients, 19 (12.0%) were found to have RUNX1 mutations in A166G (9 cases), A142T (6 cases) and A162L (4 cases). RUNX1 mutations were more frequent in elderly patients (P < 0.01) and in cases of AML subtypes M4 and M5, and were associated with more frequent CD36 and CD7 expression as compared with the wild type. RUNX1 mutations were more likely to occur in patients with normal karyotype or karyotypes associated with moderate prognostic risks, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05).

Molecular studies have been the gold standard modality for patient assessment since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In spite of that, there are cytogenetic abnormalities that can render the disease unresponsive to conventional therapy, thus making cytogenetics an important component of patient management guidelines. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a Tajik, Afghan patient with chronic myeloid leukemia with del(6)(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome who, despite having typical clinical and hematological disease with initial response to therapy, progressed to blast crisis very early and thus required special interventions. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic monitoring is an important pillar in the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia that cannot be ignored. It should therefore be a part of patient management not only during diagnosis but also during management.

It is known to expel many potent antineoplastic drugs, owing to its efflux function. Efflux of chemotherapeutics because of BCRP develops resistance to many drugs, leading to failure in cancer treatment. BCRP plays an important role in physiology by protecting the organism from xenobiotics and other toxins. It is a half-transporter affiliated to the ATP- binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, encoded by the gene ABCG2 and functions in response to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Regulation of BCRP expression is critically controlled at molecular levels, which help in maintaining the balance of xenobiotics and nutrients inside the body. Expression of BCRP can be found in brain, liver, lung cancers and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Moreover, it is also expressed at high levels in stem cells and many cell lines. This frequent expression of BCRP has an impact on the treatment procedures and, if not scrutinized, may lead to the failure of many cancer therapies.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Mehendale-Munj, Sonali', 'Sawant, Shivangi']","['Mehendale-Munj S', 'Sawant S']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Vivekanand Education Society's College of Pharmacy, Hashu Advani Memorial Complex, Behind Collector's Colony, Chembur (E), Mumbai 400074, Affiliated to University of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Vivekanand Education Society's College of Pharmacy, Hashu Advani Memorial Complex, Behind Collector's Colony, Chembur (E), Mumbai 400074, Affiliated to University of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABCG2', '*BCRP', '*BCRP inhibitors', '*mitoxantrone-resistance protein', '*multidrug resistance', '*transporter']",,2020/11/28 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/11/27 05:29'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/27 05:29 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2021;22(4):420-428. doi: 10.2174/1389450121999201125200132.,20211126,10.2174/1389450121999201125200132 [doi],"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/genetics', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Xenobiotics/pharmacology']","['CDT-EPUB-111839 [pii]', '10.2174/1389450121999201125200132 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the etiology of AML remains unknown, exposure to genotoxic agents or some prior hematologic disorders could lead to the development of this condition. The pathogenesis of AML involves the development of malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells that undergo successive genomic alterations, ultimately giving rise to a full-blown disease. From the disease biology perspective, AML is considered to be extremely complex with significant genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic variations. Molecular and cytogenetic alterations in AML include mutations in those subsets of genes that are involved in normal cell proliferation, maturation and survival, thus posing significant challenge to targeting these pathways without attendant toxicity. In addition, multiple malignant cells co-exist in the majority of AML patients. Individual subclones are characterized by unique genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, which contribute to the differences in their response to treatment. As a result, despite a dramatic progress in our understanding of the pathobiology of AML, not much has changed in therapeutic approaches to treat AML in the past four decades. Dose and regimen modifications with improved supportive care have contributed to improved outcomes by reducing toxicity-related side effects. Several drug candidates are currently being developed, including targeted small-molecule inhibitors, cytotoxic chemotherapies, monoclonal antibodies and epigenetic drugs. This review summarizes the current state of affairs in the pathobiological and therapeutic aspects of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The 5-year overall survival rate for AML patients is approximately 25%. Circa 35% of all patients carry a mutation in the FLT3 gene which have a poor prognosis. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has become a treatment strategy in AML patients possessing FLT3 mutations. The most common mutations are internal tandem duplications (ITD) within exon 14 and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that leads to a point mutation in the D835 of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Variations in the ITD sequence and the occurrence of other point mutations that lead to ligand-independent FLT3 receptor activation create difficulties in developing personalized therapeutic strategies to overcome observed mutation-driven drug resistance. Midostaurin and quizartinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with inhibitory efficacy against FLT3-ITD, but exhibit limited clinical impact. In this review, we focus on the structural aspects of the FLT3 receptor and correlate those mutations with receptor activation and the consequences for molecular and clinical responsiveness towards therapies targeting FLT3-ITD positive AML.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We herein present the results of a registry study on 2,936 AML patients undergoing allo-SCT in first remission (CR1) with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score less than or equal to 80%. Two-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, and relapse-free survival (GRFS) rates were 54%, 59%, and 41%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, patients with a KPS score = 80% had lower non-relapse mortality (NRM) and superior OS in comparison to patients with a KPS score <80% (p < 0.001). In the subgroup of patients with a KPS score =80%, a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen was associated with an increased risk of relapse (p = 0.002) and lower GRFS (p < 0.001) compared to myeloablative conditioning (MAC). Differently, in patients with a KPS score <80%, a RIC regimen resulted in lower NRM (p < 0.001), whereas relapse incidence did not differ, thus leading to an improved GRFS (p = 0.008) as compared to MAC. A transplant from a matched sibling donor (MSD) was associated with a reduced incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD (p < 0.01) and NRM (p < 0.01) in comparison to other donor types. In conclusion, allo-SCT appears feasible in AML patients with a jeopardized KPS score. Survival is significantly affected by the conditioning intensity, which should be adjusted according to the severity of KPS impairment.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

In order to ensure more precise risk stratification new molecular markers have been introduced, like expression level for BAALC (Brain and Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic) and MN1 (Meningioma 1) genes. METHODS: In this study, we investigated expression level of both genes in 111 adult AML-NK at diagnosis and examined their prognostic potential. RESULTS: BAALC and MN1 expression were detected in about one third of the patients, and positive correlation between these two genes was found. The BAALC(+) /or MN1(+) status was not associated with the presence of FLT3-ITD mutations, but exhibited strong correlation with NPM1(wt) status (P < .001). Therefore, among BAALC(+) /or MN1(+) patients the most frequent ones were FLT3-ITD(-) /NPM1(-) double negative patients with intermediate prognosis. When BAALC(+) /or MN1(+) patients were divided into BAALC(high) /BAALC(low) (21/21) and MN1(high) /MN1(low) (21/22) groups, we detected that BAALC(high) /or MN1(high) patients had a tendency toward lower complete remission rate. Also, survival analysis showed that BAALC(high) /or MN1(high) patients had shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (OS). The most pronounced influence on prognosis was detected in FLT3-ITD(-) /NPM1(-) group of patients that are lacking reliable prognostic markers, where OS in BAALC(high) /or MN1(high) was only 5 months vs 25 months in BAALC(low) /or MN1(low) . CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that BAALC and MN1 expression level could be used for more precise risk stratification of AML-NK patients and especially FLT3-ITD(-) /NPM1(-) patients, transforming this intermediate-risk group, into a group with an adverse prognosis.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Marjanovic, Irena', 'Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora', 'Kostic, Tatjana', 'Virijevic, Marijana', 'Vukovic, Nada Suvajdzic', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Tosic, Natasa']","['Marjanovic I', 'Karan-Djurasevic T', 'Kostic T', 'Virijevic M', 'Vukovic NS', 'Pavlovic S', 'Tosic N']","['Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201126,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['BAALC gene expression', 'MN1 gene expression', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'normal karyotype', 'prognosis']",,2020/11/27 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/11/26 12:09'],"['2020/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/26 12:09 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Jun;43(3):433-440. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13405.

It was recently reported that Smyd1 levels are modulated by inflammatory processes. Since inflammation affects the vascular endothelium, this study aimed to characterize Smyd1 expression in endothelial cells. We detected Smyd1 in human endothelial cells (HUVEC and EA.hy926 cells), where the protein was largely localized in PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). By transfection of EA.hy926 cells with expression vectors encoding Smyd1, PML, SUMO1, active or mutant forms of the SUMO protease SuPr1 and/or the SUMO-conjugation enzyme UBC9, as well as Smyd1- or PML-specific siRNAs, in the presence or absence of the translation blocker cycloheximide or the proteasome-inhibitor MG132, and supported by computational modeling, we show that Smyd1 is SUMOylated in a PML-dependent manner and thereby addressed for degradation in proteasomes. Furthermore, transfection with Smyd1-encoding vectors led to PML up-regulation at the mRNA level, while PML transfection lowered Smyd1 protein stability. Incubation of EA.hy926 cells with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha resulted in a constant increase in Smyd1 mRNA and protein over 24 h, while incubation with IFN-gamma induced a transient increase in Smyd1 expression, which peaked at 6 h and decreased to control values within 24 h. The IFN-gamma-induced increase in Smyd1 was accompanied by more Smyd1 SUMOylation and more/larger PML-NBs. In conclusion, our data indicate that in endothelial cells, Smyd1 levels are regulated through a negative feedback mechanism based on SUMOylation and PML availability.

However, the roles and mechanisms of HOTAIR in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are still unclear and need to be investigated. In this study, we induced differentiation of four AML cell lines by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and found HOTAIR was significantly upregulated in the process. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that C/EBPbeta upregulated HOTAIR during ATRA induced differentiation in HL-60 cells. By gain- and loss-of-function analysis, we then observed that HOTAIR expression was positively correlated with ATRA-induced differentiation and negatively regulated G1 phase arrest in HL-60 cells. In addition, we found that HOTAIR promoted ATRA-induced differentiation via the regulation of the cell cycle regulator p21 via miR-17-5p. Moreover, we detected the expression of HOTAIR in 84 de novo AML patients, HOTAIR was found significantly downregulated in the AML patients compared to the iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) control group, negatively correlated with the platelet level in M2 patients. In all, our data suggest that HOTAIR may be subtype-specific in AML-M2 patients, also HOTAIR regulates AML differentiation by C/EBPBbeta/HOTAIR/miR-17-5p/p21 pathway. The findings of the present study provide a novel insight into the mechanism of lncRNA-mediated differentiation and indicate that HOTAIR may be a promising therapeutic target for leukaemia, especially for AML with M2 type.Abbreviation: AML: acute myeloid leukaemia; APL: acute promyelocytic leukaemia; ATRA: all-trans retinoic acid; CCK8: cell Counting Kit-8; CDKs: cyclin-dependent kinases ; CeRNA: competing endogenous RNAs; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHX: cycloheximide; FAB: French-American-British; FCM: flow cytometry; HOTAIR: HOX transcript antisense RNA; IDA: iron-deficiency anemia; lncRNA: long non-coding RNA; 3'UTR: 3'untranslated region; MT: Mutation type; WT: Wild type; qRT-PCR: Quantitative real-time PCR.",,"['Hu, Linhui', 'Liu, Jun', 'Meng, Ye', 'Zheng, Huimin', 'Ding, Chen', 'Wang, Huiping', 'Charwudzi, Alice', 'Li, Manman', 'Li, Jingrong', 'Zhai, Zhimin', 'Xiong, Shudao']","['Hu L', 'Liu J', 'Meng Y', 'Zheng H', 'Ding C', 'Wang H', 'Charwudzi A', 'Li M', 'Li J', 'Zhai Z', 'Xiong S']","[""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Emergency, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology/Hematological Lab, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Center of Hematology Research, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201209,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,PMC8489933,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATRA', '*HOTAIR', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*differentiation', '*miR-17-5p', '*p21']",,2020/11/27 06:00,2020/11/27 06:00,['2020/11/26 08:39'],"['2020/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/26 08:39 [entrez]']",ppublish,RNA Biol. 2021 Oct;18(10):1434-1444. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1854520.

The presence of natural retinoids in vivo could influence the efficacy of pharmacologic agonists and antagonists. We found that natural RXRA ligands, but not RARA ligands, were present in murine MLL-AF9-derived myelomonocytic leukemias in vivo and that the concurrent presence of receptors and ligands acted as tumor suppressors. Pharmacologic retinoid responses could be optimized by concurrent targeting RXR ligands (e.g. bexarotene) and RARA ligands (e.g. all-trans retinoic acid, ATRA), which induced either leukemic maturation or apoptosis depending on cell culture conditions. Co-repressor release from the RARA:RXRA heterodimer occurred with RARA activation, but not RXRA activation, providing an explanation for the combination synergy. Combination synergy could be replicated in additional, but not all, AML cell lines and primary samples, and was associated with improved survival in vivo, although tolerability of bexarotene administration in mice remained an issue.

RINF may act as an epigenetic regulator and has been proposed as a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic malignancies. However, functional studies in normal hematopoiesis are lacking, and its mechanism of action is unknow. Here, we evaluated the consequences of RINF silencing on cytokineinduced erythroid differentiation of human primary CD34+ progenitors. We found that RINF is expressed in immature erythroid cells and that RINF-knockdown accelerated erythropoietin-driven maturation, leading to a significant reduction (~45%) in the number of red blood cells (RBCs), without affecting cell viability. The phenotype induced by RINF-silencing was TGFbeta-dependent and mediated by SMAD7, a TGFbeta- signaling inhibitor. RINF upregulates SMAD7 expression by direct binding to its promoter and we found a close correlation between RINF and SMAD7 mRNA levels both in CD34+ cells isolated from bone marrow of healthy donors and MDS patients with del(5q). Importantly, RINF knockdown attenuated SMAD7 expression in primary cells and ectopic SMAD7 expression was sufficient to prevent the RINF knockdowndependent erythroid phenotype. Finally, RINF silencing affects 5'-hydroxymethylation of human erythroblasts, in agreement with its recently described role as a Tet2- anchoring platform in mouse. Altogether, our data bring insight into how the epigenetic factor RINF, as a transcriptional regulator of SMAD7, may fine-tune cell sensitivity to TGFbeta superfamily cytokines and thus play an important role in both normal and pathological erythropoiesis.",,"['Astori, Audrey', 'Matherat, Gabriel', 'Munoz, Isabelle', 'Gautier, Emilie-Fleur', 'Surdez, Didier', 'Zermati, Yael', 'Verdier, Frederique', 'Zaidi, Sakina', 'Feuillet, Vincent', 'Kadi, Amir', 'Lauret, Evelyne', 'Delattre, Olivier', 'Lefevre, Carine', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne', 'Dusanter-Fourt, Isabelle', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Pendino, Frederic']","['Astori A', 'Matherat G', 'Munoz I', 'Gautier EF', 'Surdez D', 'Zermati Y', 'Verdier F', 'Zaidi S', 'Feuillet V', 'Kadi A', 'Lauret E', 'Delattre O', 'Lefevre C', 'Fontenay M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Bouscary D', 'Hermine O', 'Mayeux P', 'Pendino F']","['Universite de Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM, CNRS, F-75014 Paris, France;

Molecular docking data illustrated the binding capacity of puerarin with COVID-19 and the effective anti-COVID-19 activity of puerarin. Taken together, our current network pharmacology-based findings revealed the pharmacological role of puerarin in the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, the bioinformatic findings elucidated that some of these pivotal targets might serve as potential molecular markers for detecting COVID-19.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

It is nevertheless mandatory to find new targets and active molecules for innovative therapeutic strategies as relapse is associated with a very dismal outcome. We designed an experimental workflow to highlight the conserved core pathways associated with leukemogenesis by confronting the gene expression profiles (GEPs) of human T-ALL cases to the GEP of a murine T-ALL representative model, generated by the conditional deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in T cell precursors (tPTEN-/-). We identified 844 differentially expressed genes, common GEPs (cGEP) that were conserved between human T-ALL and murine signatures, and also similarly differentially expressed, compared to normal T cells. Using bioinformatic tools we highlighted in cGEPan upregulation of E2F, MYC and mTORC1. Next, using Connectivity Map (CMAP) and CMAPViz a visualization procedure for CMAP data that we developed, we selected in silico three FDA-approved, bioactive molecule candidates: alpha-estradiol (alpha-E), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and prochlorperazine dimaleate (PCZ). At a biological level, we showed that the three drugs triggered an apoptotic cell death in a panel of T-ALL cell lines, activated a DNA damage response and interfered with constitutive mTORC1 activation and c-MYC expression. This analysis shows that the investigation of conserved leukemogenesis pathways could be a strategy to reveal new avenues for pharmacological intervention.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Bonnet, Nebout, Brousse, Reinier, Imbert, Rohrlich and Peyron.']","['Bonnet, Raphael', 'Nebout, Marielle', 'Brousse, Carine', 'Reinier, Frederic', 'Imbert, Veronique', 'Rohrlich, Pierre Simon', 'Peyron, Jean-Francois']","['Bonnet R', 'Nebout M', 'Brousse C', 'Reinier F', 'Imbert V', 'Rohrlich PS', 'Peyron JF']","[""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CHU de Nice, Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, INSERM, C3M, Nice, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201109,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7680901,['NOTNLM'],"['CMAP', 'PTEN tumor suppressor gene', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'conserved genes', 'drug-repositioning']",,2020/11/27 06:00,2020/11/27 06:01,['2020/11/26 05:47'],"['2020/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/26 05:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/27 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 9;10:557643. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.557643. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.557643 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.557643 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, response rates are only around 40% and responses are mostly transient. For HMA-refractory patients the prognosis is poor and there are no therapies approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Combinations of HMAs, especially along with immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promising signals in both the frontline and HMA-refractory setting. Several other novel agents including orally available and longer acting HMAs, the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, oral agents targeting driver mutations (IDH1/2, FLT3), immunotherapies, and new options for intensive chemotherapy have been studied with variable success and will be reviewed herein. Except for the minority of patients with targetable driver mutations, HMAs - likely as part of combination therapies - will remain the backbone of frontline MDS treatment.

Herein, to understand the potential distributions and relationships between synthetic lethal interactions between genes, especially for pairs deriving from different sources, we performed an integrative analysis of genes at multiple molecular levels. Based on inter-species phylogenetic conservation of synthetic lethal interactions, gene pairs from yeast and humans were analyzed; a total of 37,588 candidate gene pairs containing 7,816 genes were collected. Of these, 49.74% of genes had 2-10 interactions, 22.93% were involved in hallmarks of cancer, and 21.61% were identified as core essential genes. Many genes were shown to have important biological roles via functional enrichment analysis, and 65 were identified as potentially crucial in the pathophysiology of cancer. Gene pairs with dysregulated expression patterns had higher prognostic values. Further screening based on mutation and expression levels showed that remaining gene pairs were mainly derived from human predicted or validated pairs, while most predicted pairs from yeast were filtered from analysis. Genes with synthetic lethality were further analyzed with their interactive microRNAs (miRNAs) at the isomiR level which have been widely studied as negatively regulatory molecules. The miRNA-mRNA interaction network revealed that many synthetic lethal genes contributed to the cell cycle (seven of 12 genes), cancer pathways (five of 12 genes), oocyte meiosis, the p53 signaling pathway, and hallmarks of cancer.

O-GlcNAcylation (O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation) is a reversible post-translational modification known to serve important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis especially in hematopoietic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. O-GlcNAcylation activity requires only two enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). OGT catalyzes attachment of GlcNAc sugar to serine, threonine and cytosine residues in proteins, while OGA hydrolyzes O-GlcNAc attached to proteins. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that TETs can be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT, with consequent alteration of TET activity and stability. The present review focuses on the cellular, biological and biochemical functions of TET and its O-GlcNAcylated form and proposes a model of the role of TET/OGT complex in regulation of target proteins during cancer development.

Multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in T1DM pathogenesis. Although histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been reported to be involved in T1DM, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the potential regulatory role of Hdac3 on T1DM progression. The expression of miR-296-5p and B-cell leukemia-XL (BCL-XL) was determined using RT-qPCR and Western blot assay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with T1DM, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)- and cycloheximide (CHX)-induced cell model, and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model. The binding affinity between miR-296-5p and Bcl-xl was verified by using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and the binding between Hdac3 and the promoter region of miR-296-5p was validated using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Western blot analysis and flow cytometry were conducted to assess the apoptotic events of lymphocytes. miR-296-5p expression was downregulated while BCL-XL expression was upregulated in PBMCs of patients with T1DM. An adverse correlation was identified between miR-296-5p and Bcl-xl in mouse TE15 B lymphocytes. Bcl-xl was further validated to be targeted and negatively regulated by miR-296-5p in 293 T cells. Hdac3 inhibited miR-296-5p expression by binding to its promoter region. The effects of overexpressed Hdac3 on lymphocyte apoptosis was counterweighed via downregulation of Bcl-xl or upregulation of miR-296-5p, the mechanism of which was further validated in a rat model of DM. Taken together, the Hdac3-mediated upregulation of Bcl-xl via inhibiting miR-296-5p promoter activity enhanced the anti-apoptotic capacity of lymphocytes to accelerate the occurrence of T1DM.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Hu, Che, Yang, Xie and Tian.']","['Hu, Qibo', 'Che, Guanghua', 'Yang, Yu', 'Xie, Hongchang', 'Tian, Jing']","['Hu Q', 'Che G', 'Yang Y', 'Xie H', 'Tian J']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201102,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7667129,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell leukemia-XL', 'apoptosis', 'histone deacetylase 3', 'microRNA-296-5p', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'type 1 diabetes mellitus']",,2020/11/27 06:00,2020/11/27 06:01,['2020/11/26 05:45'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/26 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/27 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Nov 2;11:536854. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.536854. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fgene.2020.536854 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fgene.2020.536854 [doi]'],,,,,,,,['Front Genet. 2021 Sep 22;12:715061.

As a result, PID patients are more prone to develop life-threatening complications, including cancer. PID currently include over 400 different disorders, however, the variety of PID-related cancers is narrow. We discuss here reasons for this clinical phenotype. Namely, PID can lead to cell intrinsic failure to control cell transformation, failure to activate tumor surveillance by cytotoxic cells or both. As the most frequent tumors seen among PID patients stem from faulty lymphocyte development leading to leukemia and lymphoma, we focus on the extensive genomic alterations needed to create the vast diversity of B and T lymphocytes with potential to recognize any pathogen and why defects in these processes lead to malignancies in the immunodeficient environment of PID patients. In the second part of the review, we discuss PID affecting tumor surveillance and especially membrane trafficking defects caused by altered exocytosis and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. As an impairment of these membrane trafficking pathways often results in dysfunctional effector immune cells, tumor cell immune evasion is elevated in PID. By considering new anti-cancer treatment concepts, such as transfer of genetically engineered immune cells, restoration of anti-tumor immunity in PID patients could be an approach to complement standard therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Mastio, Saeed, Wurzer, Krecke, Westerberg and Thomas.']","['Mastio, Jerome', 'Saeed, Mezida B', 'Wurzer, Hannah', 'Krecke, Max', 'Westerberg, Lisa S', 'Thomas, Clement']","['Mastio J', 'Saeed MB', 'Wurzer H', 'Krecke M', 'Westerberg LS', 'Thomas C']","['Department of Oncology, Cytoskeleton and Cancer Progression, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Cytoskeleton and Cancer Progression, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Oncology, Cytoskeleton and Cancer Progression, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Cytoskeleton and Cancer Progression, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201109,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7680899,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*actin cytoskeleton', '*cancer', '*cytotoxic cells', '*exocytosis', '*immunological synapse', '*membrane trafficking', '*primary immunodeficiencies']",,2020/11/27 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/11/26 05:45'],"['2020/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/26 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 9;11:581119. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.581119. eCollection 2020.,20210617,10.3389/fimmu.2020.581119 [doi],,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology', 'DNA Repair/genetics/immunology', 'Exocytosis/genetics/immunology', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases/*complications/genetics/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Escape/genetics']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.581119 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Licorice (GC), a traditional herbal medicine, has been commonly used as a detoxifier for poisons and drugs, and may be an effective drug for CP-induced hepatotoxicity. However, its mechanism and the effector molecules remain ambiguous. Therefore, in this study, a network pharmacology and proteomics-based approach was established, and a panoramic view of the detoxification of GC on CP-induced hepatotoxicity was provided. The experimental results indicated that GC can recover functional indices and pathological liver injury, inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis, upregulate B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, and downregulate cellular tumor antigen p53 (p53), caspase-3, malondialdehyde high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) levels. Proteomics indicated that GC regulates phosphatidylcholine translocator ABCB1 (ABCB1B), canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 (ABCC2), cytochrome P450 4A2 (CYP4A2), cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), estrogen receptor (ESR1), and DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A), inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses, and accelerates drug metabolism.

Methods: Circ_0002232 expression in 115 AML patients and 48 controls was detected by using real-time quantitative PCR. The diagnostic value of circ_0002232 expression was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyse the impact of circ_0002232 for overall survival. Associated network of circ_0002232 was predicted by using interaction prediction websites. Results: Compared with controls, circ_0002232 was notably low-expressed in AML (P<0.001). According to the result of receiver operating characteristic curve, circ_0002232 expression could distinguish AML patients from controls (P<0.001). There were significant differences in patients' age (P=0.004), FAB classifications (P=0.036), white blood cell count (P=0.041) and platelet count (P=0.021) between low-expressed circ_0002232 group and high-expressed circ_0002232 group. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between circ_0002232 expression and patients' age (Pearson r=0.256, P=0.0057). Interestingly, we found that patients in low-expressed circ_0002232 group had better overall survival both in whole AML (P=0.030) and non-APL AML (P=0.014). Remarkably, the expression of circ_0002232 was positively correlated with PTEN (Spearman r=0.678, P<0.001). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation in AML between circ_0002232 and miR-92a-3p (Spearman r=-0.301, P=0.016), miR-92a-3p and PTEN (Spearman r=-0.324, P=0.034). Interaction prediction websites revealed that circ_0002232 might affect the expression of PTEN and the process of AML through sponging miR-92a-3p. Conclusion: Circ_0002232, one of the circRNAs transcribed from PTEN, was remarkably down-regulated in AML and could act as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of AML.

Despite advances in therapeutics, a substantial number of patients succumb to the disease. Several subtypes of leukemia are inherently more resistant to treatment despite intensive chemotherapy or targeted therapy. METHODS: Here we describe the generation of T cell engaging (CD3) bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) built on humanized IgG frameworks using the IgG(L)-scFv format against two targets expressed on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Each BsAb mediated potent anti-leukemia effect against ALL (CD19) and AML (CD33) in vitro and in xenograft models. Importantly, the CD19-specific BsAb (BC250) was effective against hematogenous spread preventing metastases to liver and kidney in mice bearing ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma xenografts. BC250 was more potent than the The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved BsAb blinatumomab against ALL xenografts in vivo as measured by tumor bioluminescence and mouse survival. Furthermore, the combination of the CD19 and CD33 BsAbs in two xenograft models of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (biphenotypic and bilineal leukemia) was far superior than monotherapy with either of the BsAbs alone. CONCLUSIONS: Selective combinations of these leukemia-specific BsAb offer the potential to overcome tumor heterogeneity or clonal escape in the modern era of antibody-based T cell-driven immunotherapy.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Methods: From June 2019 to May 2020, three clinical cases were found with forward and reverse ABO typing discrepancy or atypical serologic agglutination pattern in the laboratory and blood transfusion department of Hebei Yanda Ludaopei Hospital were selected. Sequence-specific primer PCR (PCR-SSP) and Sanger sequencing of ABO gene coding regions were performed to determine the ABO genotypes, and whole transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze ABO and FUT1 gene expression levels. Results: A 12-year-old female acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient was determined as O.01.02 and BA.04 sub-genotype, corresponding to the serological B(A) subtype, and her ABO gene expression was normal (354.80). A 41-year-old female acute myeloid leukemia patient was determined as A1.02 and B.01 genotype, corresponding to the serological A(1)B phenotype, and her ABO gene expression was significantly reduced (45.70). A 42-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome and myelofibrosis was determined as A1.02 and A2.05 sub-genotype, corresponding to the serological A(1) and A(2) phenotype, respectively, and his ABO expression was negative. FUT1 expression was in the normal range in all three cases. The clinical blood product infusion strategy was formulated according to the genotype and the corresponding immunological subtype, and no significant transfusion-related adverse reactions occurred.

Among the several drugs used for the management of relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (idelalisib and duvelisib), B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor (venetoclax), and novel CD20 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated the greatest improvements in survival among R/R CLL patients. However, patients with relapsed but asymptomatic CLL do not need immediate alternative treatment and should be observed until evident sign of progression. Among available approved treatments, venetoclax + rituximab for 24 months or ibrutinib as continuous therapy is recommended. Another, less recommended, option is idelalisib in combination with rituximab. The correct treatment selection depends on the type of prior therapy, response to previous treatment and side effects, presence of comorbidities, and the risk of drug toxicity. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and investigational therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy are promising treatment options for high-risk patients, including those progressing after 1 or more targeted therapies.

When allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is performed, maintenance TKI is generally given for a fixed duration. However, the optimal duration of TKI outside of HSCT remains unknown, and the common practice is to continue indefinitely. Here, we report characteristics and outcomes of 9 patients treated with chemotherapy + TKI without HSCT and later discontinued TKI. METHODS: Among 188 patients with Ph-positive ALL who did not undergo HSCT, 9 of them discontinued maintenance TKI mainly due to side effects. Patients were closely monitored with serial PCR testing for the BCR-ABL1 transcript. Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as BCR-ABL1 transcript </=0.1% on the international scale for p210 transcripts and a 3-log reduction from baseline for p190 transcripts. Deep molecular remission (DMR) was defined as the absence of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts with a sensitivity of 0.01%. Molecular relapse was defined as loss of MMR. Treatment-free remission (TFR) was defined from time of TKI discontinuation to molecular relapse, last follow-up, or death from any cause. RESULTS: At the time of TKI discontinuation, transcript level was undetected in 6 patients, <0.01% in 2 patients, and 0.01% in another patient. Prior to discontinuation, the median duration of TKI therapy and of DMR was 70 and 47 months, respectively. No morphological relapse occurred. Three patients (33%) had molecular relapse at a median of 6 months. All 3 resumed TKI therapy, and 2 of them regained DMR after a median of 13 months. After a median follow-up of 49 months, the median TFR was not reached, and the 4-year TFR rate was 65%. The median duration of DMR in patients with and without molecular relapse was 22 and 58 months, respectively (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION: TKI discontinuation outside of HSCT in Ph-positive ALL in the setting of compelling toxicity may be safe only among a highly selected group of patients with deep and prolonged DMR undergoing close and frequent monitoring. Validation of these findings in prospective clinical trials is highly needed.","['(c) 2020 S.

With the advent of US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR-T therapies for B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, CAR-T therapy is poised to become part of mainstream clinical practice. OBJECTIVE.-: To educate pathologists on CAR-T and chimeric antigen receptor-derived cellular therapy, provide a better understanding of their role in this process, explain important regulatory aspects of CAR-T therapy, and advocate for pathologist involvement in the delivery and monitoring of chimeric antigen receptor-based treatments. Much of the focus of this article addresses US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies; however, more general issues and future perspectives are considered for therapies in development. DESIGN.-: A CAR-T workgroup, facilitated by the College of American Pathologists Personalized Health Care Committee and consisting of pathologists of various backgrounds, was convened to develop a summary guidance paper for the College of American Pathologists Council on Scientific Affairs. RESULTS.-: The workgroup identified gaps in pathologists' knowledge of CAR-T therapy, including uncertainty in the role of the clinical laboratory in supporting CAR-T therapy. The workgroup considered these issues and summarized the findings to assist pathologists to become stakeholders in CAR-T therapy administration.

Transcriptomic profiling studies have thus far revealed the presence of molecular subtypes of AML that are not accounted for by standard clinical parameters or by routinely used biomarkers. Such molecular subtypes of AML are predicted to vary in response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is an important group of proteins that play a critical role in regulating blood pressure, vascular resistance and fluid/electrolyte balance. RAS pathway genes are also known to be present locally in tissues such as the bone marrow, where they play an important role in leukemic hematopoiesis. In this study, we asked if the RAS genes could be utilized to predict drug responses in patients with AML. We show that the combined in silico analysis of up to five RAS genes can reliably predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin as well as Etoposide in AML. The same genes could also predict sensitivity to Doxorubicin when tested in vitro. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of TNF-alpha and type-I IFN response genes among sensitive, and TGF-beta and fibronectin related genes in resistant cancer cells. However, this does not seem to reflect an epithelial to mesenchymal transition per se. We also identified that RAS genes can stratify patients with AML into subtypes with distinct prognosis.

Methods: Anthropometric parameters [height (H), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), WC/H, and WC/HC ratio], blood pressure, lipid profile, serum markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction [Interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule, tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-alpha), Endogenous secretory Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (Es-RAGE)], and carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) were assessed in a group of young ALL survivors and in matched controls. Local Ethics Committee approved the study (code 56/13) on June 24, 2013. Results: 28 ALL survivors (71% male, 18% prepubertal, aged 15.98 +/- 4.41 years, mean follow-up 8.57 +/- 3.14 years) exhibited lower levels of Es-RAGE than controls (0.18 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.08 ng/mL, p < 0.001).

Epigenetic deregulation is a critical event in early malignancies. Thus, we aimed to (1) analyze DNA methylation changes during the transition from preneoplastic lesions to early HCC (eHCC) and identify candidate epigenetic gatekeepers, and to (2) assess the prognostic potential of methylation changes in cirrhotic tissue. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Methylome profiling was performed using Illumina HumanMethylation450 (485,000 cytosine-phosphateguanine, 96% of known cytosine-phosphateguanine islands), with data available for a total of 390 samples: 16 healthy liver, 139 cirrhotic tissue, 8 dysplastic nodules, and 227 HCC samples, including 40 eHCC below 2cm. A phylo-epigenetic tree derived from the Euclidean distances between differentially DNA-methylated sites (n = 421,997) revealed a gradient of methylation changes spanning healthy liver, cirrhotic tissue, dysplastic nodules, and HCC with closest proximity of dysplasia to HCC. Focusing on promoter regions, we identified epigenetic gatekeeper candidates with an increasing proportion of hypermethylated samples (beta value > 0.5) from cirrhotic tissue (<1%), to dysplastic nodules (>/=25%), to eHCC (>/=50%), and confirmed inverse correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression for TSPYL5 (testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 5), KCNA3 (potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related subfamily, member 3), LDHB (lactate dehydrogenase B), and SPINT2 (serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 2) (all P < 0.001). Unsupervised clustering of genome-wide methylation profiles of cirrhotic tissue identified two clusters, M1 and M2, with 42% and 58% of patients, respectively, which correlates with survival (P < 0.05), independent of etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide DNA-methylation profiles accurately discriminate the different histological stages of human hepatocarcinogenesis. We report on epigenetic gatekeepers in the transition between dysplastic nodules and eHCC. DNA-methylation changes in cirrhotic tissue correlate with clinical outcomes.",['(c) 2020 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],"['Hernandez-Meza, Gabriela', 'von Felden, Johann', 'Gonzalez-Kozlova, Edgar E', 'Garcia-Lezana, Teresa', 'Peix, Judit', 'Portela, Anna', 'Craig, Amanda J', 'Sayols, Sergi', 'Schwartz, Myron', 'Losic, Bojan', 'Mazzaferro, Vincenzo', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Llovet, Josep M', 'Villanueva, Augusto']","['Hernandez-Meza G', 'von Felden J', 'Gonzalez-Kozlova EE', 'Garcia-Lezana T', 'Peix J', 'Portela A', 'Craig AJ', 'Sayols S', 'Schwartz M', 'Losic B', 'Mazzaferro V', 'Esteller M', 'Llovet JM', 'Villanueva A']","['Division of Liver Diseases, Liver Cancer Program, Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Division of Liver Diseases, Liver Cancer Program, Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'I.

The present work was carried out to develop silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) using the plant (Achillea millefolium or yarrow) aqueous extract as both a reducing and capping agent under the green synthesis method. Characterization of synthesized Ag-NPs was done using IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis). The UV-vis spectrum showed the maximum absorbance at around 440-470 nm, which suggested the formation of green synthesized Ag-NPs. The morphological study demonstrated that the Ag-NPs were spherical in shape with an average size of 22.4 +/- 7.4 nm. The antimicrobial activities of Ag-NPs against Fusarium and Aspergillus niger species of fungal and Escherichia coli species of bacteria were investigated through the disc diffusion and well-diffusion method using their zone of inhibition. The cytotoxicity effect of Ag-NPs on cell lines MOLT-4 was evaluated by using MTT assay. These nanoparticles showed remarkable antimicrobial activity against bacterias and fungus in low concentration. The cytotoxicity studies showed that IC50 of green synthesized Ag-NPs was 0.011 microm in comparison to 1.8 for Cisplatin which more active than anticancer drug for MOLT-4 cell line.

Because of the favorable outcome of most patients with CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a greater number of comorbidities might be the most significant adverse feature for long-term survival. The presence of comorbidities may also affect the risk of developing adverse events with TKIs. This effect is perhaps best exemplified by the risk of developing arterio-occlusive events, which is greatest for patients who have other risk factors for such events, with the risk increasing with higher numbers of comorbidities. The coexistence of comorbidities in patients with CML not only may affect TKI selection but also demands close monitoring of the overall health condition of the patient to optimize safety and provide the opportunity for an optimal outcome to such patients.

Among these, natural products are one of the most important resources from which novel agents are developed due to the multiple pharmacologic effects of these natural products on diseases. Tanshinone, a representative natural product, is the main compound extracted from the dried root and rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. Research on tanshinone began in the early 1930s. With the in-depth investigation of an increasing number of identified analogs, tanshinone has demonstrated a wide variety of bioactivities and contradicted the saying, 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'. This review is focused on the pharmacological action of tanshinone and status of research on tanshinone in recent years. The mechanism of tanshinone has also drawn much attention, with the findings of representative targets and pathways of tanshinone. The most recent studies have comprehensively shown that tanshinone can be used to treat leukemia and solid carcinoma, protect against cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and alleviate liver- and kidney-related diseases, among its other effects. Multiple signaling pathways, including antiproliferative, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative stress pathways, are involved in its actions.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

More selective, efficient, and less toxic anticancer agents are needed. We synthesized seven, new, optically pure (12aS)-1,3,4,12a-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-c][1,4],12(2H,11H)-dione derivatives and examined their cytotoxicity towards eight cancer cell lines, including urinary bladder (TCC-SUP, UM-UC-3, KU-19-9), colon (LoVo), and breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) cancer representatives, as well as two leukemic cell lines (MV-4-11, CCRF-CEM) and normal murine fibroblasts (Balb/3T3) as reference cell line. Three of the seven newly-obtained compounds ((12aS)-8-bromo-2-(3-phenylbenzoyl)-1,3,4,12a-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-c][1,4],12(2 H,11H)-dione, (12aS)-8,9-dimethoxy-2-(4-phenylbenzoyl)-1,3,4,12a-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-c][1,4] ,12(2H,11H)-dione and (12aS)-8-nitro-2-(4-phenylbenzoyl)-1,3,4,12a-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-c][1,4],12(2H ,11H)-dione, showed enhanced activity and selectivity toward the leukemic MV-4-11 cell lines when compared to our previously reported compounds, with IC50 values in the range of 2.9-5.6 muM. Additionally, (12aS)-9-nitro-2-(4-phenylbenzoyl)-1,3,4,12a-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-c][1,4],12(2H ,11H)-dione exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect against the leukemic CCRF-CEM (IC50 =6.1 muM) and MV-4-11 (IC50 =11.0 muM) cell lines, a moderate cytotoxic effect toward other tumor lines (IC50 =31.8-55.0 muM) and very weak cytotoxic effect toward the Balb/3T3 reference cell lines. Selected compounds were further evaluated for their potential to induce apoptotic cell death in MV-4-11 cells by measuring caspase-3 activity. We also established the crystal structure of three products and investigated the effect of 22 derivatives of 1,3,4,12a-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-c][1,4],12(2H,11H)-dione on the activity of the cancer-associated enzyme autotaxin. All compounds proved to be weak inhibitors of autotaxin, although some (R) and (S) enantiomers had Ki values of 10-19 muM. The obtained results showed that the tested compounds exhibited a selective antileukemic effect, which appeared not to be related directly to autotaxin. Molecular targets responsible for this effect remain to be identified.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the budgetary impact of introducing GO to a 1-million-member US health plan over a 5-year period. METHODS: We developed models to estimate the impact of introducing GO in combination with conventional induction chemotherapy or as monotherapy for newly diagnosed AML, and as monotherapy for R/R AML. Models were built using data on drug costs and treatment-related outcomes obtained from published clinical trials and other publicly available sources. Results were reported on a per member/per year and per member/per month (PMPM) basis. RESULTS: Base-case results of the newly diagnosed model indicated that the addition of GO in the combination setting reduced the overall budget of a 1-million-member health plan. The estimated net cost (US$) savings ranged from $72,969 ($0.006 PMPM) in year 1 to $745,426 ($0.062 PMPM) in year 5. In the monotherapy setting, GO was associated with increased net costs ranging from $4118 (0.0003 PMPM) in year 1 to $31,885 ($0.003 PMPM) in year 5. Base-case results of the R/R AML model demonstrated increased net costs that ranged from $17,326 ($0.001 PMPM) in year 1 to $46,163 ($0.004 PMPM) in year 5. Scenario analyses in all settings indicated the budget impact was not overly sensitive to the selected input assumptions, with the exception of the scenario considering only the pharmacy budget impact in the combination setting. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of GO for newly diagnosed and R/R AML would have a minimal impact on the budget of a US health plan and could result in cost savings in the combination therapy setting for newly diagnosed AML.",,"['Mamolo, Carla', 'Welch, Verna', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Cappelleri, Joseph C', 'Brockbank, James', 'Cawson, Matthew', 'Knight, Chris', 'Wilson, Michele']","['Mamolo C', 'Welch V', 'Walter RB', 'Cappelleri JC', 'Brockbank J', 'Cawson M', 'Knight C', 'Wilson M']","['Patient & Health Impact, Pfizer Inc, 445 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT, 06833, USA. carla.mamolo@pfizer.com.', 'Patient & Health Impact, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Statistics, Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT, USA.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Manchester, UK.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Manchester, UK.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Manchester, UK.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201125,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,PMC7790788,,,,2020/11/26 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2020/11/25 05:50'],"['2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/25 05:50 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2021 Jan;39(1):121-131. doi: 10.1007/s40273-020-00976-6.

With this background, we compared outcomes among 377 cases of CR following consecutive HID-HSCT for AML (CR) to 86 MUD and 92 MSD-HSCT cases. All patients received BU-based myeloablative conditioning and an unmanipulated graft within the same period. The median patient age was 23 years (range 1.1 to 65 years), and 230 patients (41.4%) were under age18. Among the 555 patients, 432 (77.8%) were of intermediate cytogenetic risk and 123 (22.2%) were of adverse risk. A total of 113 patients (20.5%) had FLT3-ITD+ AML, 425 patients (76.6%) were in first complete remission (CR1) post-transplant, and 130 (23.4%) patients were in second CR (CR2). GVHD prophylaxis included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclosporine-A (CSA) with short-term methotrexate (MTX) for HID, and MUD-HSCT. MMF is not used for MSD-HSCT. The median survival follow-up time was 42 months (range 18-91 months). The 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) among the HID, MUD, and MSD cohorts was 73.8% +/- 4.8%, 66.4% +/- 8.5%, 74.5% +/- 2.4%, respectively (P = 0.637). Three-year overall survival (OS) was 74.9% +/- 2.4%, 81.8% +/- 4.3%, and 77.5% +/- 4.5% among the HID, MUD, and MSD cohorts, respectively (P = 0.322). There were no difference among the relapse rate among the HID, MUD, and MSD donor cohorts (14.3% +/- 4.0% vs 20.3% +/- 6.4% vs 14.5% +/- 2.2, respectively; P = 0.851) or the non-relapse mortality (NRM) (12.3% +/- 3.5% vs 9.5% +/- 3.2% vs 14.0% +/- 1.8%, respectively; P = 0.441). Multivariate analyses showed that MRD-positive pre-HSCT was the only risk factor associated with a lower OS and LFS and higher risk of relapse among all 555 patients. Compared with the use of a MUD or MSD, an HID for HSCT had similar outcomes among AML patients with CR states who underwent an allo-HSCT with BU-based myeloablative conditioning. MFC-MRD-positive pre-HSCT was an independent negative factor impact on outcomes for AML patients in CR.

Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a role in the regulation of cellular senescence, and its expression increases with age. However, there has been limited research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of periodontal inflammaging, and the interplay between TLR4 and inflammaging. In the present study, wildtype and TLR4 gene knockout mice were used to investigate the activation of the TLR4 pathway in mouse periodontitis and the expression of the nucleotidebinding and oligomerization domainlike receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, an upstream immune checkpoint during the development of inflammaging. Activation of TLR4 in a mouse model of periodontitis enhanced the expression of a senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP), which boosted the inflammaging process. Conversely, TLR4 activation downregulated the expression of B cellspecific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1) and promoted the priming of NLRP3 inflammasome, both of which are regulators of SASP. Treating gingival fibroblasts with Bmi1 inhibitor PTC209, it was demonstrated that TLR4 activated the NLRP3 pathway and the inflammaging process by suppressing Bmi1. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the expression of Bmi1 expression in the gingiva of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy controls. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TLR4 acted by inhibiting Bmi1 to enhance the NLRP3 pathway and SASP factors.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to describe genetic alterations, clinical courses, outcomes, and complications in all known pituitary blastoma cases. DESIGN AND SETTING: A multi-institutional case series is presented from tertiary pediatric oncology centers. PATIENTS: Patients included children with pituitary blastoma. INTERVENTIONS: Genetic testing, surgery, oncologic therapy, endocrine support are reported. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included survival, long-term morbidities, and germline and tumor DICER1 genotypes. RESULTS: Seventeen pituitary blastoma cases were studied (10 girls and 7 boys); median age at diagnosis was 11 months (range, 2-24 months). Cushing syndrome was the most frequent presentation (n = 10). Cushingoid stigmata were absent in 7 children (2 with increased adrenocorticotropin [ACTH]; 5 with normal/unmeasured ACTH). Ophthalmoplegia and increased intracranial pressure were also observed. Surgical procedures included gross/near-total resection (n = 7), subtotal resection (n = 9), and biopsy (n = 1). Six children received adjuvant therapy. At a median follow-up of 6.7 years, 9 patients were alive; 8 patients died of the following causes: early medical/surgical complications (n = 3), sepsis (n = 1), catheter-related complication (n = 1), aneurysmal bleeding (n = 1), second brain tumor (n = 1), and progression (n = 1). Surgery was the only intervention for 5 of 9 survivors. Extent of resection, but neither Ki67 labeling index nor adjuvant therapy, was significantly associated with survival. Chronic complications included neuroendocrine (n = 8), visual (n = 4), and neurodevelopmental (n = 3) deficits. Sixteen pituitary blastomas were attributed to DICER1 abnormalities.

MRD can be assessed using methodologies including flow cytometry and molecular genetics, with the former being rapid, relatively inexpensive, and widely applicable in many hematopathology/flow cytometry laboratories. METHODS: This article presents an approach to MRD detection in B-LL/L by flow cytometry through case presentations with illustration of several potential pitfalls. We review normal maturation patterns, antigens used for assessment, flow panels that can be utilized, considerations to be made during therapy, and clinical impact. The benefits and drawbacks when using the ""different from normal"" and ""leukemia associated phenotype"" approaches are considered. RESULTS: Evaluation for MRD in B-LL/L by flow cytometry relies on a knowledge of normal immunophenotypic patterns associated with B-cell maturation in states of rest and marrow regeneration so that one can identify patterns of antigen expression that differentiate abnormal, leukemic populations from regenerating hematogones or B-cell precursors. The nature of therapy can affect normal patterns, a phenomenon especially important to take into consideration given the increased use of targeted therapies in the treatment of B-LL/L. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry is widely available in many laboratories and is a cost-effective way to evaluate for B-LL/L MRD. However, panel validation and interpreter education are crucial for accurate assessment.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020. All rights reserved.

The exact cell of origin of ECD is unknown, although some limited evidence suggests that it arises from myeloid progenitors. Case Presentation: A 43-year-old patient, diagnosed with BRAF (V600E) mutated ECD, developed NPM1(+)/FLT3(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with wild-type BRAF, 15 months after the initial ECD diagnosis. The patient received intensive chemotherapy plus midostaurin, followed by midostaurin maintenance. Six months into maintenance, the patient remains in complete remission with low-level measurable residual disease, whereas ECD shows a sustained partial metabolic response. Molecular karyotype at several distinct timepoints, namely ECD diagnosis, AML diagnosis, and following treatment of AML, highlighted a molecular signature, indicative of a persistent, underlying clonal hematopoiesis. Conclusion: This case report suggests that ECD and AML might represent an expansion of two distinct clones in a background of clonal hematopoiesis, indicating their shared origin. Moreover, molecular karyotype might serve as a strong, inexpensive tool for revealing clonal hematopoiesis in cases of negative targeted next-generation sequencing. Finally, the moderate response of ECD to midostaurin suggests that kinase inhibition might have a potential role in ECD treatment.",['(c) 2020 Papageorgiou et al.'],"['Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Divane, Aspasia', 'Roumelioti, Maria', 'Kottaridi, Christine', 'Bouchla, Anthi', 'Georgakopoulos, Alexandros', 'Ieremiadou, Fotini', 'Daraki, Aggeliki', 'Bazani, Efthymia', 'Thomopoulos, Thomas P', 'Chatziioannou, Sofia', 'Mavrogenis, Andreas', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Panayiotides, Ioannis G', 'Pappa, Vasiliki', 'Foukas, Periklis G']","['Papageorgiou SG', 'Divane A', 'Roumelioti M', 'Kottaridi C', 'Bouchla A', 'Georgakopoulos A', 'Ieremiadou F', 'Daraki A', 'Bazani E', 'Thomopoulos TP', 'Chatziioannou S', 'Mavrogenis A', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Panayiotides IG', 'Pappa V', 'Foukas PG']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, Hematology Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '""LIFE CODE"" Private Diagnostic Laboratory, Medical Ltd., Athens, Greece.', '1st Department of Propaedeutic Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, Hematology Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine Section, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '""LIFE CODE"" Private Diagnostic Laboratory, Medical Ltd., Athens, Greece.', '""LIFE CODE"" Private Diagnostic Laboratory, Medical Ltd., Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, Hematology Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, Hematology Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine Section, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', 'Nuclear Medicine Section, Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens, BRFAA, Athens, Greece.', '1st Department of Orthopaedics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '1st Department of Propaedeutic Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, Hematology Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.', '2nd Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201116,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC7678692,['NOTNLM'],"['Erdheim-Chester disease', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'case report', 'clonal hematopoiesis', 'midostaurin', 'molecular karyotype']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],2020/11/26 06:00,2020/11/26 06:01,['2020/11/25 05:45'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/25 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/26 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Nov 16;13:11689-11695. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S276497. eCollection 2020.,,10.2147/OTT.S276497 [doi],,,,"['10.2147/OTT.S276497 [doi]', '276497 [pii]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3376-837X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0807-0719']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in this population. Ninety-five patients transplanted in first (n = 75) or second (n = 20) complete remission (CR) from either HLA-matched sibling (n = 32), unrelated (n = 47) or haploidentical (n = 16) donor were included in the analysis. The probabilities of the overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years were 55% and 47%, respectively. Relapse incidence (RI) was 32% while non-relapse mortality (NRM), 21%. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD was 34% and 30%, respectively. The probability of GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 35%. In a multivariate analysis positive minimal residual disease (MRD) status was associated with decreased chance of LFS (HR = 3.15, p = 0.004) and OS (HR = 2.37, p = 0.049) as well as increased risk of relapse (HR = 5.87, p = 0.003). Disease stage (CR2 vs. CR1) affected all, LFS, OS, GRFS, RI, and NRM.

However, its impact on patients' responsiveness to therapy and patient's outcome was not previously addressed. This study was conducted on 60 T-ALL pediatric patients at diagnosis and 10 nonleukemic controls. Cortactin and HS1 expressions were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cortactin and HS1 expression were significantly higher in T-All patients as compared with controls as well as postinduction levels (P</=0.001 for both). The high cortactin expression was significantly associated with high peripheral white cell counts (P</=0.001), blood blast cells (P</=0.001) and central nervous system (CNS) infiltration (P</=0.001), and early precursor T-ALL subtype (P</=0.001) as compared with the remaining groups. The induction of remission response was significantly higher in T-ALL patients with lower cortactin expression levels as compared with T-ALL patients with higher one (P</=0.001). The high cortactin and HS1 expressions were significantly predictors of CNS infiltrations (hazard ratios [HR]: 1.051, confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.13, P=0.04 and HR: 1.87, CI: 1.23-2.091, P=0.002, respectively) and bone marrow relapse (HR: 1.43, CI: 1.18-1.92, P=0.004 and HR: 1.07, CI: 1.01-1.24, P=0.002, respectively). Furthermore, high cortactin expression levels were associated with shorter B-ALL patients' overall survival as compared with those with lower cortactin levels (P=0.002). In conclusion, high expression of cortactin and/or HS1 at diagnosis is a bad prognostic marker of T-ALL patients' outcome. Moreover, cortactin and/or HS1 expression could be used as a biomarker for refining risk stratification of T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Disruption of such regulations can result in craniofacial birth defects. Here, we propose the first developmental stage-specific network approach by integrating two crucial regulators, transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), to study their co-regulation during craniofacial development. Specifically, we used TFs, miRNAs and non-TF genes to form feed-forward loops (FFLs) using genomic data covering mouse embryonic days E10.5 to E14.5. We identified key novel regulators (TFs Foxm1, Hif1a, Zbtb16, Myog, Myod1 and Tcf7, and miRNAs miR-340-5p and miR-129-5p) and target genes (Col1a1, Sgms2 and Slc8a3) expression of which changed in a developmental stage-dependent manner. We found that the Wnt-FoxO-Hippo pathway (from E10.5 to E11.5), tissue remodeling (from E12.5 to E13.5) and miR-129-5p-mediated Col1a1 regulation (from E10.5 to E14.5) might play crucial roles in craniofacial development. Enrichment analyses further suggested their functions. Our experiments validated the regulatory roles of miR-340-5p and Foxm1 in the Wnt-FoxO-Hippo subnetwork, as well as the role of miR-129-5p in the miR-129-5p-Col1a1 subnetwork. Thus, our study helps understand the comprehensive regulatory mechanisms for craniofacial development.",['(c) 2020.

We conducted two clinical trials to verify the safety and efficacy of GC027, an ""off-the-shelf"" allogeneic CAR-T product targeting T-cell antigen, CD7. Here, we report 2 patients as case reports with relapsed/refractory T-ALL who were treated with GC027. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Both the trials reported here were open-label and single-arm. A single infusion of GC027 was given to each patient after preconditioning therapy. RESULT: Robust expansion of CAR-T cells along with rapid eradication of CD7(+) T lymphoblasts were observed in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid. Both patients achieved complete remission with no detectable minimal residual disease. At data cutoff, 30 September 2020, 1 of the 2 patients remains in ongoing remission for over 1 year after CAR T-cell infusion. Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in both patients and was managed by a novel approach with a ruxolitinib-based CRS management. Ruxolitinib showed promising activity in a preclinical study conducted at our center. No graft-versus-host disease was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The two case reports demonstrate that a standalone therapy with this novel CD7-targeted ""off-the-shelf"" allogeneic CAR-T therapy may provide deep and durable responses in select patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL. GC027 might have a potential to be a promising new approach for treating refractory/relapsed T-ALL.

IL3RA is frequently expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), presenting an opportunity to treat AML and HL with an IL3RA-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). Here, we describe BAY-943 (IL3RA-ADC), a novel IL3RA-targeting ADC consisting of a humanized anti-IL3RA antibody conjugated to a potent proprietary kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi). In vitro, IL3RA-ADC showed potent and selective antiproliferative efficacy in a panel of IL3RA-expressing AML and HL cell lines. In vivo, IL3RA-ADC improved survival and reduced tumor burden in IL3RA-positive human AML cell line-derived (MOLM-13 and MV-4-11) as well as in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (AM7577 and AML11655) in mice. Furthermore, IL3RA-ADC induced complete tumor remission in 12 out of 13 mice in an IL3RA-positive HL cell line-derived xenograft model (HDLM-2). IL3RA-ADC was well-tolerated and showed no signs of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or liver toxicity in rats, or in cynomolgus monkeys when dosed up to 20 mg/kg.

This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of pediatric AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations in the pre-FLT3 inhibitor era. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and identified 18 patients diagnosed with non-M3 AML with FLT3-ITD mutations at Seoul National University Children's Hospital between May 2008 and August 2019. Results: The median age was 13 years (range, 6?19 yr). The median follow-up time was 43 months (range, 6?157 mo). Fourteen patients received BH-AC-based (N4-Behenoy1-1-b-D-arabinofuranosy1cytosine) and 4 received cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 72.2% of the patients after the first induction chemotherapy and 80% of the patients achieved CR after salvage therapy. The overall CR rate was 94% (17/18 patients). These 17 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (9 matched unrelated donors, 5 matched related donors, and 3 haploidentical donors). Relapse occurred in 22% of the patients. Event free survival and overall survival rates were 53.8+/-12.1% and 53.6+/-12.1%, respectively, and they were not significantly different according to the type of induction chemotherapy (P=0.690) or the type of donor (P=0.102). Conclusion: This study outlines the outcomes of pediatric AML patients with FLT3-ITD-mutations in one institution over a decade. Outcomes were significantly improved in this study compared to our previous report in 2004, where RFS and EFS were 0%.

METHODS: In the development set (n = 412), parameters including age, hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, biallelic CEBPA mutations, DNMT3A mutations, FLT3-ITD/NPM1 status, and ELN cytogenetic risk status were identified as independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. A nomogram combining these predictors for individual risk estimation was established thereby. FINDINGS: The prognostic model demonstrated promising performance in the development cohort. The calibration plot, C-index (0.74), along with the 1-, 2- and 3-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, 0.76, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively) in the validation set (n = 238) substantiated the robustness of the model. In addition to stratifying young (age </= 60 years) and elderly patients (age > 60 years) into three and two risk groups with significant distinct outcomes, the prognostic model succeeded in distinguishing eligible candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. INTERPRETATION: The prognostic model is capable of survival prediction, risk stratification and helping with therapeutic decision-making with the use of easily acquired variables in daily clinical routine.

We examined the role of traffic related pollution on lymphohematopoietic malignancies among under-14 s in Sao Paulo. METHODS: All incident cases between 2002 and 2011 were collected from a population-based registry. Exposures were assigned on residential address at diagnosis via traffic density database (for the year 2008) and a satellite derived NO2 land use regression model (averaged between 1997 and 2011). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated via Poisson Regression adjusted by age, gender and socioeconomic status (SES), with additional stratification by SES. RESULTS: A positive association between traffic and NO2 with some lymphohematopoietic malignancies was observed with the degree of effect differing by SES. For example, lymphoid leukemia IRRs in the lower SES group were 1.21 (95 % CI: 1.06, 1.39) for traffic density and 1.38 (95 % CI: 1.13, 1.68) for NO2. In the higher group they were 1.06 (95 % CI: 1.00, 1.14) and 1.37 (95 % CI: 1.16, 1.62). CONCLUSION: NO2 and traffic density were associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia among children in Sao Paulo.

Owing to the rarity of MS, the clonal evolution of cell populations giving rise to MS is not well understood. To study the genomic signature of MS, we used a capture-based next-generation sequencing panel targeting 479 cancer genes to interrogate the genetic variants present in MS samples and compared their genetic profiles with their paired AML samples from a cohort of seven individuals. We identified a spectrum of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and a spectrum of copy number alterations in MS. Our study found that variant profiles observed in MS were generally similar to AML from the same individual, supporting the notion that these tumors are derived from a common precursor, rather than de novo tumors in a susceptible host. In addition, MS cases with a higher number of SNVs show worse clinical outcomes than MS with a lower number of SNVs.

33232037,,Publisher,,,,,2022 Jan,Cancer Chemotherapy,,"The three events that led to the development of cancer treatment began with three events in the last century: the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen, the use of transplantable animal-tumor models in cancer research, and the first surgical procedure developed by Halsted (radical mastectomy).[1] The term ""chemotherapy"" was coined by German chemist Paul Ehrlich who investigated the use of drugs to treat infectious diseases. He was also the first scientist to study animal models to screen a series of chemicals regarding their potential activity against diseases. Historical documents suggest the use of arsenicals started in the 1900s. Radiotherapy ad surgery were the mainstays of cancer management in the 1960s. As micrometastases and recurrence of cancer after surgery and radiation therapy became evident, combination chemotherapy started gaining significance.[2] Publication of the Lindskog article suggesting the success of nitrogen mustard in the treatment of lymphoma had a considerable initial effect on the development of cancer chemotherapy, including oral derivatives like chlorambucil and ultimately cyclophosphamide.[2] The discovery of actinomycin D pioneered the search for more antitumor antibiotics, including anthracyclines, mitomycin, and bleomycin.[3] Farber et al., in 1947, showed success in the treatment of childhood leukemia by using antimetabolites with antifolate activity, called aminopterin, later be known as methotrexate.[4] The successful management of choriocarcinoma and leukemias with methotrexate led to further investigations in cancer chemotherapy. And drugs like thiopurines (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine), 5-fluorouracil came into the forefront of cancer treatment.[5] Nowell et al. studied the association of translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 to several leukemias, which later led to developing the first molecular targeted treatments years later (imatinib).[6] Charles Huggins won a Nobel Prize in 1966 for investigations on hormone therapy in prostate cancer.[7] This work was a stepping stone to a new era of hormone therapy, with the introduction of drugs like tamoxifen and anastrozole, etc.[8][9] With an increased understanding of the biology of cancer, there are now several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies available. rituximab and trastuzumab were approved during the late 1990s to treat lymphoma and breast cancer, respectively.[10] Molecular targeted therapy is a new approach to cancer treatment. Several agents have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the last decade. Researchers are designing molecular targeted therapy on these pathways, selectively inhibiting growth, e.g., targeting cell signaling or angiogenesis, blocking protein degradation, etc. Targeted therapies are discussed as a separate topic[11]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors PD1, PDL1, CTLA 4, which cause immune activation against cancer cells, are widely used in various cancers. Immunotherapy is discussed in a separate topic.","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Amjad, Muhammad T.', 'Chidharla, Anusha', 'Kasi, Anup']","['Amjad MT', 'Chidharla A', 'Kasi A']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,2020/11/26 06:01,2020/11/26 06:01,,,,,,,,,,['NBK564367 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,20201126,['20211117'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2020/11/26 06:01'],,,,,
33232028,,Publisher,,,,,2022 Jan,Radiation Effects On The Fetus,,"Embryogenesis is a complex process and is divided between pre-implantation, embryo, and fetal period. This process is highly susceptible to various external factors such as teratogenic drugs, alcohol, smoking, radiation, and even the lack of appropriate nutrition. Ionizing radiation way more than non-ionizing has known effects in developing fetus with fatal outcomes. Malignancy is relatively uncommon during pregnancy, with a low incidence of 0.02 to 0.1%. The most common malignancies found are breast, skin including melanoma, gynecological (uterine, cervix, and ovarian), and hematological (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)).[1] Generally, when rivaled with patients who received surgical monotherapy, survivors who underwent abdominopelvic radiation with or without surgery were more likely to have infants that were premature, low-birth weight, and even associated with perinatal mortality in few cases.[2] Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk of unfavorable pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with prior history of abdominopelvic irradiation, possibly due to radiation-induced uterine damage. Since high-dose uterine irradiation can restrict the pregnant uterus' growth and cause vascular changes that impair uterine blood flow, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth are common.[3] Signorello et al. observed that infants of patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy (>5 Gy) to the uterus were at a heightened risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and small for gestational age when compared with offspring of patients who did not receive radiotherapy.[4] Green et al. observed that the incidence of fetal malposition, early or threatened labor, low birth weight, and prematurity were higher with elevated radiation doses.[5] When compared to radiotherapy, chemotherapy does not appear to have harmful effects on the uterus.[6] Hence it generally has favorable pregnancy outcomes in patients treated only with chemotherapy. Those who conceived >/=one year after post-chemotherapy without radiation or >/=two years after chemotherapy with radiation displayed no elevated risks to pregnancy outcomes.[7] Fetal Risks From Ionizing Radiation Significant potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation can be summarised into four main categories: Pregnancy loss (miscarriage, stillbirth). Malformation. Disturbances of growth or development. Mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. While treating cancer in pregnant patients with radiotherapy, the goal is to improve the mother overall survival; however, specific considerations are vital to reduce the fetus's possible adverse implications. Earlier, the norm was to terminate the ongoing pregnancy, regardless of the trimesters. Fortunately, because of the advent of the latest developments of evidence and technology in the last two decades, we have steered away from this blanket policy. Since the 1990s, various technological and technical advancements in modern radiotherapies, such as 3D-conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy, have made it possible to give high doses to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues or organs in the vicinity, hence improving radiotherapy in terms of effectiveness and tolerability.[8] Furthermore, IMRT techniques using on-board cone-beam computed tomography have evolved to ensure a precise dose delivery.[9] The detrimental principle of all radiation is that it should be ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) as the effects of radiation are linearly cumulative. In practice, even though the fetus is excluded from the direct radiation field, the fetus gets radiation leaking from the accelerator and collimator dispersions. To cut down this radiation, we use lead blocks and shields to achieve ALARA. Childhood malignancy in the context of prenatal diagnostic and assessment X-ray was first reported by Giles et al. in 1956.[10] Their survey of childhood cancers established that the risk increased linearly with the number of films exposed. The relative risk of developing a childhood cancer-associated was significantly higher if the exposure was during the first trimester, about 2.5 times greater than the third trimester. This study became the working model of various radiation-induced teratogenesis studies. A defining study was by Kato et al., where they followed up the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs.[11] It was the most extensive cohort study of intrauterine radiation exposure; interestingly, only 2 cases had childhood cancer before the 14th birthday out of 1630 children exposed without a single case of leukemia. Broadly, radiation effects are expressed as being either deterministic or stochastic. 1. Deterministic effects have a cause and effect relationship such that below a certain threshold, the effect will not occur. However, once the threshold has been crossed, the effect of significance will increases linearly with every next dose. Deterministic effects on a fetus range from congenital malformations, lower intelligence quotient (IQ), mental retardation, microcephaly, various neurobehavioral dysfunctions leading to increased risk of seizures and growth retardation, fetal death, and increased cancer risk.[12] A threshold dose of 0.1Gy has been reported on several occasions. The risks are uncertain between 0.05 Gy to 0.1Gy and deemed negligible when below 0.05Gy. Pathologically, these effects occur when a large number of cells are irradiated during a critical developmental stage of organogenesis. 2. The stochastic effect represents the radiation effects that may occur by chance, such as cancer induction. For this to occur, there is no threshold dose observed, and the risk manifolds in a linear-quadratic manner of the dose. Childhood cancers are primarily the result of the stochastic effect, as seen in the post-Chernobyl disaster with the increased thyroid cancer occurrence. Ionizing radiation induces these effects by causing structural changes at the cellular and molecular levels. Non-ionizing radiation (which is not associated with medical imaging or radiotherapy) causes damage through heat transfer, such as microwave heating. Furthermore, by producing free radicals, ionizing radiation causes cellular damage by interfering with chemical bonds between molecules regulating critical cellular processes and events. This process generally leads to DNA mutation or cell death and sometimes causes damage to essential cellular enzymes. Susceptibility to radiation injury depends on the rate of cellular proliferation and differentiation of exposed tissues. Hence lymphoproliferative tissues with rapid cell turnover are the most susceptible, while nervous tissue with little or no cell turnover is the least affected.","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Kumar, Rahul', 'De Jesus, Orlando']","['Kumar R', 'De Jesus O']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,2020/11/26 06:01,2020/11/26 06:01,,,,,,,,,,['NBK564358 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,20201126,['20211023'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2020/11/26 06:01'],,,,,

METHODS: The efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic antibiotic calicheamicin, was evaluated in R/R ALL patients in the phase 1/2 study 1010 (NCT01363297) and open-label, randomized, phase 3 study 1022 (INO-VATE; NCT01564784). This analysis focused specifically on Ph+ R/R ALL patients. In study 1022, Ph+ patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to InO (n = 22) or standard intensive chemotherapy (SC) (n = 27) and 16 Ph+ patients in study 1010 received InO. RESULTS: In study 1022, rates of complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (patients achieving CR/CRi) were higher with InO (CR/CRi = 73%; MRD = 81%) versus SC (CR/CRi = 56%; MRD = 33%). The corresponding rates in study 1010 were 56% (CR/CRi) and 100% (MRD). The hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) rate in study 1022 was 41% versus 19% for InO versus SC; however, there was no benefit in overall survival (median OS: 8.7 vs 8.4 months; hazard ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.64-2.14]). The probability of being event-free (progression-free survival) at 12 months was greater with InO versus SC (20.1% vs 4.8%). CONCLUSION: Given the substantial improvement in responses and rates of HSCT, InO is an important treatment option for patients with R/R Ph+ ALL. Future studies need to consider better characterization of disease characteristics, more sensitive MRD measurements, MRD-directed therapy before HSCT, and potentially combination therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

To accelerate anti-ZIKV therapeutics research, we developed a stable ZIKV GFP-reporter virus system with considerably improved GFP visibility and stability. In this system a BHK-21 cell line expressing DC-SIGNR was established to facilitate the proliferation of GFP-reporter ZIKV. Using this reporter virus system, we established a high-throughput screening assay and screened a selected plant-sourced compounds library for their ability to block ZIKV infection. More than 31 out of 974 tested compounds effectively decreased ZIKV reporter infection. Four selected compounds, homoharringtonine (HHT), bruceine D (BD), dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and digitonin (DGT), were further validated to inhibit wild-type ZIKV infection in cells of BHK-21 and human cell line A549. The FDA-approved chronic myeloid leukemia treatment drug HHT and BD were identified as broad-spectrum flavivirus inhibitors. DHA, another FDA-approved antimalarial drug effectively inhibited ZIKV infection in BHK-21 cells. HHT, BD and DHA inhibited ZIKV infection at a post-entry stage. Digitonin was found to have inhibitory activity in the early stage of viral infection. Our research provides an efficient high-throughput screening assay for ZIKV inhibitors.

However, the mechanism underlying glucocorticoid (GC) resistance remains unclear. This study was performed to identify GC resistance-related genes using the transcriptome chip from the GEO database, and preliminarily analyze drug resistance mechanism in B-ALL. Here, we found that ANXA5 expression was upregulated in B-ALL cells and high-level ANXA5 was associated with dexamethasone (DEX) resistance. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed to silence ANXA5 expression in the B-ALL cell lines, and the apoptotic rate of cells treated with DEX was detected by flow cytometry. As a result, cell apoptosis was dramatically promoted in B-ALL cells following silencing of ANXA5 and DEX administration versus that in ANXA5-silenced alone or DEX-treated alone cells. It was further found that down-regulation of ANXA5 in B-ALL cells significantly increased the relative amount of cleaved Caspase 3 and Caspase 9 induced by DEX.

Members are typically oncogenic in leukemia while their functional roles in other cancers alternate between that of a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter. Targets of the miR-99 family rank in the lists of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, thereby illustrating the dual role of this miR family as oncogenic miRs (oncomiRs) and tumor suppressing miRs (TSmiRs) in different cellular contexts. In addition to their functional roles in cancers, miR-99 family is implicated in the modulation of macrophage inflammatory responses and T-cell subsets biology, thereby exerting critical roles in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, establishment of peripheral tolerance as well as resolution of an inflammatory reaction. Here, we review emerging knowledge of this miR family and discuss remaining concerns linked to their activities. A better dissection of the functional roles of miR-99 family members in cancer and immunity will help in the development of novel miR-99-based therapeutics for the treatment of human cancer and immune-related diseases.

A recent phase-3 study compared VEN combined with either azacitidine or placebo, in the aforementioned study population; the complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rates were 28.3% and 66.4%, respectively, and an improvement in overall survival was also demonstrated. VEN-based chemotherapy has also shown activity in relapsed/refractory AML (CR/CRi rates of 33-46%), high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (CR 39% in treatment naive, 5-14% in HMA failure), and blast-phase myeloproliferative neoplasm (CR 25%); in all instances, an additional fraction of patients met less stringent criteria for overall response.

Here, we demonstrate in primary leukemic cells and in cell lines that mutated ETNK1 causes a significant increase in mitochondrial activity, ROS production, and Histone H2AX phosphorylation, ultimately driving the increased accumulation of new mutations. We also show that phosphoethanolamine, the metabolic product of ETNK1, negatively controls mitochondrial activity through a direct competition with succinate at mitochondrial complex II.

Davidson was a catalyst and exemplar for explaining haematopoietic cell fate determination through gene regulation. RECENT FINDINGS: Researchers studying blood and immune cells pioneered many of the early mechanistic investigations of mammalian gene regulatory processes. These efforts included the characterization of complex gene regulatory sequences exemplified by the globin and T-cell/B-cell receptor gene loci, as well as the identification of many key regulatory transcription factors through the fine mapping of chromosome translocation breakpoints in leukaemia patients. As the repertoire of known regulators expanded, assembly into gene regulatory network models became increasingly important, not only to account for the truism that regulatory genes do not function in isolation but also to devise new ways of extracting biologically meaningful insights from even more complex information. Here we explore how Eric H. Davidson's pioneering studies of gene regulatory network control in nonvertebrate model organisms have had an important and lasting impact on research into blood and immune cell development. SUMMARY: The intellectual framework developed by Davidson continues to contribute to haematopoietic research, and his insistence on demonstrating logic and causality still challenges the frontier of research today.",,"['Rothenberg, Ellen V', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Rothenberg EV', 'Gottgens B']","['Division of Biology & Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA.', 'Wellcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,PMC7755131,,,,2020/11/25 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/11/24 05:57'],"['2020/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/24 05:57 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2021 Jan;28(1):1-10. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000628.,20210728,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000628 [doi],,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Sea Urchins/embryology/genetics']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000628 [doi]', '00062752-202101000-00002 [pii]']",,,,"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 HD100039/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119102/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1651632'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on Dunnigan phenotype, HSCT-associated lipodystrophy was suspected. Because of rapid deterioration of diabetes control, metreleptin was introduced at 23 years of age upon receipt of her caregiver's documented consent. This trial was initially planned as a prospective 18 month-long study, with regular assessments of the patient's physical activity, food intake, and body composition analysis. However, because an abrupt and transient attenuation of the metreleptin effect occurred 16 months after the treatment initiation, the entire course of 28 months is reported here. Over the period, her HbA1c decreased from 10.9% to 6.7% despite no significant increase of physical activity and with a stable food intake. Decreased levels of triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol were found. Her liver function improved, indicating the amelioration of fatty liver. In addition, a 25% reduction in the subcutaneous fat area at umbilical level was found, accompanied by a decrease in fat percentage of both total-body and trunk. The formation of neutralizing antibodies to metreleptin may be responsible for the transient loss of efficacy, considering a sudden elevation in her serum leptin level. In conclusion, metreleptin is useful for the management of HSCT-associated lipodystrophy, supporting the concept that adipose tissue dysfunction is responsible for diverse post-HSCT metabolic aberrations.",,"['Adachi, Masanori', 'Muroya, Koji', 'Hanakawa, Junko', 'Asakura, Yumi']","['Adachi M', 'Muroya K', 'Hanakawa J', 'Asakura Y']","[""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama 232-8555, Japan."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama 232-8555, Japan."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama 232-8555, Japan."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama 232-8555, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20201121,Japan,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,9313485,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'Childhood cancer survivors', 'Dunnigan phenotype', 'Leptin', 'Total body irradiation']",,2020/11/25 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2020/11/24 05:57'],"['2020/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/24 05:57 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocr J. 2021 Apr 28;68(4):399-407. doi: 10.1507/endocrj.EJ20-0325.

In this paper, a new UMI-77 based fluorescent probe (DNSH), was synthesized and characterized. DNSH bound to the hydrophobic pockets of Mcl-1 protein tightly and the binding affinity was 20-fold higher than that of previous developed Mcl-1 probe. DNSH exhibited specific fluorescence response to Mcl-1 protein rather than other proteins. In the presence of Mcl-1 protein, fluorescence emission of DNSH can be switched on. Furthermore, fluorescence colocalization experiment demonstrated that DNSH can be successfully used for imaging mitochondrial Mcl-1 protein in human prostate cancer cells without a washing process.

In multiple studies, MRSA nasal swabs have been shown to have a negative predictive value (NPV) of ~99% in non-oncology patients with pneumonia and other infections. We evaluated the performance characteristics of a negative MRSA nasal swab in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) populaion to determine its NPV. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PATIENTS: This study included adult AML patients with a suspected infection and a MRSA nasal swab collected between 2013 and 2018. METHODS: MRSA nasal swab and culture-documented infections were identified to determine the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value of the MRSA nasal swabs. RESULTS: In total, 194 patients were identified, and 484 discrete encounters were analyzed. Overall, 468 (97%) encounters had a negative MRSA nasal swab upon admission with no cultured documented MRSA infection during their hospitalization. However, 3 encounters (0.6%) had a negative MRSA nasal swab with a subsequent cultured documented MRSA infection during their admission. Identified infections were bacteremia (n = 2) and confirmed pneumonia (n = 1). MRSA nasal swab had a sensitivity of 62% (95% CI, 0.24-0.91), specificity of 98% (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), positive predictive value of 38% (95% CI, 0.21-0.6), and NPV of 99% (95% CI, 0.98-1). CONCLUSIONS: A negative MRSA nasal swab has a 99% NPV for subsequent MRSA infections in AML patients with no prior history of MRSA colonization or infection. Based on these findings, a negative MRSA nasal swab can help guide de-escalation of empiric MRSA antibiotic therapy.",,"['Perreault, Sarah K', 'Binks, Bailee', 'McManus, Dayna S', 'Topal, Jeffrey E']","['Perreault SK', 'Binks B', 'McManus DS', 'Topal JE']","['Department of Pharmacy Services, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale New Haven Hospital, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201124,United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,,,,,2020/11/25 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2020/11/24 05:39'],"['2020/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/24 05:39 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2021 Jul;42(7):853-856. doi: 10.1017/ice.2020.1299.

Here, we investigated molecular mechanism of X Inactive-Specific Transcript (XIST) in regulating cellular viability, apoptosis and drug resistance in AML. METHODS: XIST, miR-29a and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC) expression in AML bone marrow cells collected from 62 patients was evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Besides, the relationship among XIST, miR-29a and MYC was analyzed by dual luciferase reporter assay, RIP, and RNA pull down assays. AML KG-1 cells were treated with anti-tumor drug Adriamycin. The role of XIST/miR-29a/MYC in cellular viability, apoptosis and drug resistance in AML was accessed via gain- and loss-of-function approaches. At last, we evaluated role of XIST/miR-29a/MYC on tumorigenesis in vivo. RESULTS: XIST and MYC were up-regulated, and miR-29a was down-regulated in AML bone marrow cells. Silencing XIST inhibited cellular activity and drug resistance but promoted cellular apoptosis of KG-1 cells by down-regulating MYC. XIST inhibited miR-29a expression to up-regulate MYC. Moreover, silencing XIST inhibited tumorigenesis of AML cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, down-regulation of XIST decreased MYC expression through releasing the inhibition on miR-29a, thereby reducing drug resistance, inhibiting viability and promoting apoptosis of AML cells.",,"['Wang, Chong', 'Li, Lingling', 'Li, Mengya', 'Wang, Weiqiong', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Wang, Shujuan']","['Wang C', 'Li L', 'Li M', 'Wang W', 'Liu Y', 'Wang S']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No. 1, Jianshe East Road, Zhengzhou, 450052, Henan, P.

L-asparaginase was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and QFF column to 3.84-fold with specific activity of 215.33 U/mg and its molecular mass was assessed to be 41.5 kDa. Maximum enzyme activity was determined at pH 8.2 and 40 degrees C and with retaining 70% of its activity after incubation for 1 h at 50 degrees C. Km and Vmax values were determined to be 0.0047 M and 92.74, respectively. Cytotoxicity test indicated a significant safety of L-asparaginase on Vero cells with selectivity against leukemia, breast cancer and hepatoma cells. NFS-60 cells was the most sensitive tumor cells to L-asparaginase with IC50 of 10.29 microg/ml and selectivity index of 30.61. This selectivity was recognized to be an apoptosis-dependent mechanism proven via cell cycle arrest in sub-G1 phase and fragmentation of genomic DNA. L-asparaginase showed antioxidant activity against both DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC50 values of 64.07 and 177.1 mg/ml, respectively. These competitive advantage of bacterial L-asparaginase over than other sources is that it might be produced in large amounts through production in large-scale biofermenters, which decreases costs, besides having a sustainable bacterial source. Our findings established that the potent cytotoxic effect of L-asparaginase isolated from B. halotolerans OHEM18 may be a promise candidate for further medicinal applications as an antioxidant and antitumor drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Here, we review the incidence and the current management of CD19+ CAR T-cell complications. We highlight frequently occurring events, such as cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, metabolic complications, secondary macrophage-activation syndrome, and prolonged cytopenia. Furthermore, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that CAR T-cell-mediated toxicities can involve any other organ system and we discuss the potential risk of long-term complications.

However, due to TKI resistance acquisition in CML patients, identification of new vulnerabilities is urgently required for a sustained response to therapy. In this study, we have investigated metabolic reprogramming induced by TKIs independent of BCR-ABL1 alterations. Proteomics and metabolomics profiling of imatinib-resistant CML cells (ImaR) was performed. KU812 ImaR cells enhanced pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen synthesis, serine-glycine-one-carbon metabolism, proline synthesis and mitochondrial respiration compared with their respective syngeneic parental counterparts. Moreover, the fact that only 36% of the main carbon sources were utilized for mitochondrial respiration pointed to glycerol-phosphate shuttle as mainly contributors to mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, CML cells that acquire TKIs resistance present a severe metabolic reprogramming associated with an increase in metabolic plasticity needed to overcome TKI-induced cell death. Moreover, this study unveils that KU812 Parental and ImaR cells viability can be targeted with metabolic inhibitors paving the way to propose novel and promising therapeutic opportunities to overcome

Through their activation, they can be polarized towards the pro-inflammatory M1 type or the wound healing-associated, anti-inflammatory M2 type macrophages. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), M2 is the dominant phenotype and these cells are referred to as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs secrete cytokines and chemokines, exerting an antiapoptotic, proliferative and pro-metastatic effect on the tumor cells. TAMs can be found in many cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where they are called nurse-like cells (NLCs). Despite the generally indolent behavior of CLL, the proportion of treatment-refractory patients is significant. As with the majority of cancers, despite significant recent progress, CLL pathogenesis is poorly understood. The emerging role of the TME in nurturing the neoplastic process warrants the investigation of macrophages as a significant pathogenetic element of tumors. In this paper, we review the current knowledge on the role of stromal macrophages in CLL.",,"['Mesaros, Oana', 'Jimbu, Laura', 'Neaga, Alexandra', 'Popescu, Cristian', 'Berceanu, Iulia', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Fetica, Bogdan', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea']","['Mesaros O', 'Jimbu L', 'Neaga A', 'Popescu C', 'Berceanu I', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Fetica B', 'Zdrenghea M']","['Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Babes str., 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Babes str., 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Babes str., 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Babes str., 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, County Emergency Hospital Alba Iulia, 20 Decebal str., 510093 Alba-Iulia, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Babes str., 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Babes str., 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201119,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,PMC7699370,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'macrophages', 'nurse-like cells']",,2020/11/25 06:00,2020/11/25 06:01,['2020/11/24 01:06'],"['2020/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Nov 19;8(11). pii: biomedicines8110516. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8110516.,,E516 [pii] 10.3390/biomedicines8110516 [doi],,,,"['biomedicines8110516 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8110516 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3015-9023', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5500-1519', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9461-987X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endolysosomal escape has been proposed as one mechanism for the saponin-mediated enhancement of targeted toxins. We investigated the effects of lipid depletion followed by repletion on Saponinum album (SA)-induced endolysosomal escape of Alexa Fluor labelled saporin and the saporin-based immunotoxin OKT10-SAP, directed against CD38, in Daudi lymphoma cells. Lipid deprived cells showed reduced SA-induced endolysosomal escape at two concentrations of SA, as determined by a flow cytometric method. The repletion of membrane cholesterol by low density lipoprotein (LDL) restored SA-induced endolysosomal escape at a concentration of 5 microg/mL SA but not at 1 microg/mL SA. When LDL was used to restore the cholesterol levels in lipid deprived cells, the SA augmentation of OKT10-SAP cytotoxicity was partially restored at 1 microg/mL SA and fully restored at 5 microg/mL SA. These results suggest that different mechanisms of action might be involved for the two different concentrations of SA and that endosomal escape may not be the main mechanism for the augmentation of saporin IT cytotoxicity by SA at the sub-lytic concentration of 1 microg/mL SA.",,"['Smith, Wendy S', 'Johnston, David A', 'Wensley, Harrison J', 'Holmes, Suzanne E', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U', 'Flavell, David J']","['Smith WS', 'Johnston DA', 'Wensley HJ', 'Holmes SE', 'Flavell SU', 'Flavell DJ']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Biomedical Imaging Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Abcam, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AX, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201119,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7699356,['NOTNLM'],"['augmentation', 'cholesterol', 'endosomal escape', 'immunotoxin', 'saponin', 'saporin']",,2020/11/25 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/11/24 01:06'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Nov 19;21(22). pii: ijms21228734. doi: 10.3390/ijms21228734.,20210304,E8734 [pii] 10.3390/ijms21228734 [doi],"['0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (alexa fluor 488)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cholesterol, LDL/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endosomes/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluoresceins/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Saporins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sulfonic Acids/chemistry', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']","['ijms21228734 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21228734 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2413-6717', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7145-4737']",,['LB20/1/Leukaemia Busters'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated such resistance mechanisms in relapsed/refractory early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) carrying activating NOTCH1 mutations via full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of malignant and microenvironmental cells. We identified 2 highly distinct stem-like states that critically differed with regard to cell cycle and oncogenic signaling. Fast-cycling stem-like leukemia cells demonstrated Notch activation and were effectively eliminated in patients by Notch inhibition, whereas slow-cycling stem-like cells were Notch independent and rather relied on PI3K signaling, likely explaining the poor efficacy of Notch inhibition in this disease. Remarkably, we found that both stem-like states could differentiate into a more mature leukemia state with prominent immunomodulatory functions, including high expression of the LGALS9 checkpoint molecule. These cells promoted an immunosuppressive leukemia ecosystem with clonal accumulation of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that expressed HAVCR2, the cognate receptor for LGALS9. Our study identified complex interactions between signaling programs, cellular plasticity, and immune programs that characterize ETP-ALL, illustrating the multidimensionality of tumor heterogeneity. In this scenario, combination therapies targeting diverse oncogenic states and the immune ecosystem seem most promising to successfully eliminate tumor cells that escape treatment through coexisting transcriptional programs.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Anand, Praveen', 'Guillaumet-Adkins, Amy', 'Dimitrova, Valeriya', 'Yun, Huiyoung', 'Drier, Yotam', 'Sotudeh, Noori', 'Rogers, Anna', 'Ouseph, Madhu M', 'Nair, Monica', 'Potdar, Sayalee', 'Isenhart, Randi', 'Kloeber, Jake A', 'Vijaykumar, Tushara', 'Niu, Leili', 'Vincent, Tiffaney', 'Guo, Guangwu', 'Frede, Julia', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Place, Andrew E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Teachey, David T', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Lohr, Jens G', 'Knoechel, Birgit']","['Anand P', 'Guillaumet-Adkins A', 'Dimitrova V', 'Yun H', 'Drier Y', 'Sotudeh N', 'Rogers A', 'Ouseph MM', 'Nair M', 'Potdar S', 'Isenhart R', 'Kloeber JA', 'Vijaykumar T', 'Niu L', 'Vincent T', 'Guo G', 'Frede J', 'Harris MH', 'Place AE', 'Silverman LB', 'Teachey DT', 'Lane AA', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Aster JC', 'Bernstein BE', 'Lohr JG', 'Knoechel B']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA;

We conducted a population-based study that included all patients diagnosed with HCL between 1996 and 2016 in Western Normandy. Recorded data focused on medical history, clinical presentation, biological results, treatment modalities in the first line and in relapsed/refractory patients and the occurrence of secondary malignancies. One hundred and twenty-three HCL patients were registered in the database. HCL represented 0.7% of all malignant hematological disorders and 3.0% of all leukemia. The overall age-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 0.39/100,000 inhabitants in men and 0.09/100,000 in women, and it remained stable over the 20-year period analyzed. One hundred and seven patients (88%) received first-line treatment, 33 patients (27%) received at least 2 lines of treatment and 14 patients (11%) received more than 2 lines. Cladribine used as first-line treatment induced a high hematological complete response (HCR) rate of 92%. The median overall survival (OS) was over 15 years, with 5-year and 10-year survival rates of 84% and 70.5%. No significant differences in OS were observed between men and women, between the calendar periods studied or between patients who received a single line treatment with IFN-alpha or PNA. The risk of relapse was higher with IFN-alpha treatment, requiring subsequent treatments in that patients. The time to next treatment (TTN) tends to be longer for PNAs compared to IFN-alpha even if difference is not significant. Secondary cancers were observed in 9/123 patients (7.3%) with solid tumors in 8 patients and hematological malignancy in one patient. Our data confirm in real life that single courses of cladribine administered to patients with HCL induce high response rates, the majority of which are HCR. Relapses seem less frequent than with IFN-alpha and the administration schedule is less restrictive for the patients. The emergence of chemo-immunotherapy and the development of effective new drugs such as recombinant immunotoxins and BRAF targeting will offer new possibilities in the management of HCL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Np17 is located on chromosome 8, consists of 7 exons, and encodes a 16.8kDa nuclear protein with149 amino-acid residue. Functionally, knockdown of Np17 induced growth inhibition of leukemia cells, whereas enforced expression of Np17 promoted growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. In human leukemia, Np17 was detected in 59.65% (34/57) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients examined and associated with refractory/relapsed AML. Mechanistically, Np17 decreased p53 levels and its mechanism might be involved in recruiting nuclear MDM2 to p53 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

To identify molecular differences that might distinguish TKI responders from non-responders, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on cells (n = 41,723 cells) obtained from the peripheral blood of four CML patients at different stages of treatment to generate single cell expression profiles. Analysis of our single cell expression profiles in conjunction with those previously obtained from the bone marrow of additional CML patients and healthy donors (total = 69,263 cells) demonstrated that imatinib treatment significantly altered leukocyte population compositions in both responders and non-responders, and affected the expression profiles of multiple cell populations, including non-neoplastic cell types. Notably, in imatinib poor-responders, patient-specific pre-treatment unique stem/progenitor cells became enriched in peripheral blood compared to the responders.

33226740,,Publisher,,,,,1993,ETV6 Thrombocytopenia and Predisposition to Leukemia,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with ETV6 thrombocytopenia and predisposition to leukemia most often present with a lifelong history of thrombocytopenia, which is usually in the mild to moderate range. No syndromic features or associations are consistently shared across pedigrees. Affected individuals also have a moderate risk of developing a hematologic malignancy (with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [B-ALL] being the most common) and possibly other malignant solid tumors, particularly colorectal cancer. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ETV6 thrombocytopenia and predisposition to leukemia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in ETV6 by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: For clinical bleeding, local measures with consideration of antifibrinolytic agents, desmopressin, and/or platelet transfusion if bleeding is moderate to severe. For neoplasm, standard neoplasm-specific therapy with consideration of indications for stem cell transplantation, eligibility, and available donors. Prevention of secondary complications: For individuals with a history of moderate or severe bleeding, antifibrinolytic agents or desmopressin may be considered prior to surgical procedures to reduce bleeding complications. Platelet transfusions should be used judiciously, particularly in women of childbearing age, to reduce the risk of alloimmunization. Surveillance: Complete blood count with differential every six to 12 months and consideration of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy annually. The frequency of such screening must be weighed against the burden of the screening protocol, particularly in young children. The exact frequency of CBC and bone marrow evaluations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician and in consideration of patient/family preferences. Agents/circumstances to avoid: For those with a history of bleeding, avoidance of medications that decrease platelet function (e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories) and avoidance of participation in contact sports are recommended. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of clinical surveillance for malignancy and management of potential significant thrombocytopenia. Pregnancy management: Platelet counts should be monitored during pregnancy and prior to delivery. Platelet transfusions prior to invasive procedures (e.g., epidural analgesia or caesarean section) or at the time of delivery may be considered in those with a history of bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia, on a case-by-case basis. GENETIC COUNSELING: ETV6 thrombocytopenia and predisposition to leukemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all affected individuals have inherited the ETV6 pathogenic variant from a parent, although in some instances the heterozygous parent did have any known clinical findings. The offspring of an individual with ETV6 thrombocytopenia and predisposition to leukemia are at 50% risk of inheriting the ETV6 pathogenic variant. Once the ETV6 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

We aim to describe clinical practice and clinicians' considerations on the administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions and tranexamic acid (TXA) to outpatients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or aplastic anemia (AA) in the Netherlands. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among members of the Dutch Society for Hematology. RESULTS: The survey was filled out by 73 respondents. Prophylactic platelet transfusions are widely used in acute leukemia and MDS outpatients receiving disease-modifying treatments (87%-98% of respondents). TXA is predominantly prescribed in case of bleeding (tendency) (71%-88% of respondents). Conditions potentially increasing bleeding risks highly variably influence clinicians' decision making on anti-bleeding regimens, which includes a wide range in adhered platelet thresholds. CONCLUSION: Considering that both the contribution of prophylactic platelet transfusions as well as TXA to limiting bleeding is insufficiently evidence-based, there is an urgent need for trials on optimal anti-bleeding strategies in this outpatient population, which should encompass efficacy, logistic, financial, and quality-of-life aspects.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed heights and weights of >/= 5 year survivors of pediatric ALL (diagnosed 1990-2013). Residential addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS to assign quartiles of ADI, a composite of 17 measures of poverty, housing, employment, and education, with higher quartiles reflecting greater deprivation. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between ADI quartiles and overweight/obesity or obesity alone were calculated with logistic regression. RESULTS: On average, participants (n = 454, 50.4% male, 45.2% Hispanic) were age 5.5 years at diagnosis and 17.4 years at follow-up. At follow-up, 26.4% were overweight and 24.4% obese. Compared to the lowest ADI quartile, survivors in the highest quartile were more likely to be overweight/obese at follow-up (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.23-4.44) after adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, age at diagnosis, and age at follow-up. The highest ADI quartile remained significantly associated with obesity (OR = 5.28, 95% CI: 1.79-15.54) after accounting for weight status at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into possible social determinants of health inequalities among survivors of childhood ALL by reporting a significant association between neighborhood deprivation and overweight/obesity. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Survivors of childhood ALL residing in neighborhood with greater socioeconomic disadvantage may be at increased risk of overweight and obesity and candidates for targeted interventions.","['(c) 2020.

Currently approved BTK inhibitors, including Ibrutinib, a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of BTK, bind directly to the kinase active site. While effective at blocking the catalytic activity of BTK, consequences of drug binding on the global conformation of full-length BTK are unknown. Here, we uncover a range of conformational effects in full-length BTK induced by a panel of active site inhibitors, including large-scale shifts in the conformational equilibria of the regulatory domains. Additionally, we find that a remote Ibrutinib resistance mutation, T316A in the BTK SH2 domain, drives spurious BTK activity by destabilizing the compact autoinhibitory conformation of full-length BTK, shifting the conformational ensemble away from the autoinhibited form. Future development of BTK inhibitors will need to consider long-range allosteric consequences of inhibitor binding, including the emerging application of these BTK inhibitors in treating COVID-19.","['(c) 2020, Joseph et al.']","['Joseph, Raji E', 'Amatya, Neha', 'Fulton, D Bruce', 'Engen, John R', 'Wales, Thomas E', 'Andreotti, Amy']","['Joseph RE', 'Amatya N', 'Fulton DB', 'Engen JR', 'Wales TE', 'Andreotti A']","['Roy J.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional multi-institutional study that enrolled 1657 children with cancer who were diagnosed between 2011 and 2014. Cancer type/stage, city/region of residence, and city/region of treating centre were recorded. Travel burden was measured based on a 1-way distance in kilometres from the city centre to the treatment institution. This study was supported by Sanad Children's Cancer Support Association. Results: Diagnosis was leukaemia (45.2%), non-CNS solid tumours (30.2%), lymphoma (12.3%), CNS tumours (11.8%) and histiocytosis (0.5%). Childhood cancer centres were in the same city as where the patients lived in 652 (39.3%) cases, same region but different city in 308 (18.6%), different regions in 613 (37%), and not known in 84 (5.1%). The mean 1-way travel distance for patients who lived in different regions was 790 (range, 116-1542) km. A total of 536 (32%) patients lived >/= 400 km and 216 (13%) > 1000 km from the treatment centre. Among 642 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who required 2-3 years of therapy, 197 (31%) lived >/= 400 km and 94 (15%) >1000 km from the treatment centre. Conclusions: Nearly two thirds of patients with childhood cancer lived in different cities than the treatment centres, including one third of patients who lived >/= 400 km away. There is a need to develop strategies to improve access to childhood cancer care.","['Copyright (c) World Health Organization (WHO) 2020. Open Access. Some rights', 'reserved.

It has been less studied than its cognate pediatric malignancy, which is more prevalent. A higher percentage of the adult patients relapse, compared to children. It is thus essential to study the mechanisms of relapse of adult T-ALL cases. RESULTS: We profile whole-genome somatic mutations of 19 primary T-ALLs from adult patients and the corresponding relapse malignancies and analyze their evolution upon treatment in comparison with 238 pediatric and young adult ALL cases. We compare the mutational processes and driver mutations active in primary and relapse adult T-ALLs with those of pediatric patients. A precise estimation of clock-like mutations in leukemic cells shows that the emergence of the relapse clone occurs several months before the diagnosis of the primary T-ALL. Specifically, through the doubling time of the leukemic population, we find that in at least 14 out of the 19 patients, the population of relapse leukemia present at the moment of diagnosis comprises more than one but fewer than 10(8) blasts. Using simulations, we show that in all patients the relapse appears to be driven by genetic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The early appearance of a population of leukemic cells with genetic mechanisms of resistance across adult T-ALL cases constitutes a challenge for treatment. Improving early detection of the malignancy is thus key to prevent its relapse.",,"['Sentis, Ines', 'Gonzalez, Santiago', 'Genesca, Eulalia', 'Garcia-Hernandez, Violeta', 'Muinos, Ferran', 'Gonzalez, Celia', 'Lopez-Arribillaga, Erika', 'Gonzalez, Jessica', 'Fernandez-Ibarrondo, Lierni', 'Mularoni, Loris', 'Espinosa, Lluis', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Bigas, Anna', 'Gonzalez-Perez, Abel', 'Lopez-Bigas, Nuria']","['Sentis I', 'Gonzalez S', 'Genesca E', 'Garcia-Hernandez V', 'Muinos F', 'Gonzalez C', 'Lopez-Arribillaga E', 'Gonzalez J', 'Fernandez-Ibarrondo L', 'Mularoni L', 'Espinosa L', 'Bellosillo B', 'Ribera JM', 'Bigas A', 'Gonzalez-Perez A', 'Lopez-Bigas N']","['Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Baldiri i Reixac 10, 08028, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Pathology Department, CIBERONC, Hospital del Mar, IMIM, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CMR[B] Center of Regenerative Medicine, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Pathology Department, CIBERONC, Hospital del Mar, IMIM, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain. jribera@iconcologia.net.', ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain. abigas@imim.es."", 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Research Program on Biomedical Informatics, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain. nuria.lopez@irbbarcelona.org.', 'Research Program on Biomedical Informatics, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. nuria.lopez@irbbarcelona.org.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain. nuria.lopez@irbbarcelona.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201123,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,PMC7682094,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL relapse', '*Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Evolution of leukemia relapse', '*T-ALL', '*T-ALL evolution under therapy']",,2020/11/24 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2020/11/23 08:42'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 08:42 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2020 Nov 23;21(1):284. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02192-z.,20211130,10.1186/s13059-020-02192-z [doi],"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Child', 'DNA Helicases/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']","['10.1186/s13059-020-02192-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13059-020-02192-z [pii]']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4925-8988'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the clinical and biological characteristics of AML bearing different levels of KIAA0125. We profiled KIAA0125 expression levels in bone marrow cells from 347 de novo AML patients and found higher KIAA0125 expression was closely associated with RUNX1 mutation, but inversely correlated with t(8;21) and t(15;17) karyotypes. Among the 227 patients who received standard chemotherapy, those with higher KIAA0125 expression had a lower complete remission rate, shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with lower expression. The prognostic significance was validated in both TCGA and GSE12417 cohorts. Subgroup analyses showed that higher KIAA0125 expression also predicted shorter DFS and OS in patients with normal karyotype or non-M3 AML. In multivariable analysis, higher KIAA0125 expression remained an adverse risk factor independent of age, WBC counts, karyotypes, and mutation patterns.

CD43s, a unique sialylated form of CD43 expressed by hematologic malignancies, is a recently identified target and antibodies interacting with CD43s may have therapeutic potential against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome. CD43s is recognized by the human antibody AT1413, that was derived from a high-risk AML patient who successfully cleared leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Here we observed that AT1413 binds also to certain non-hematopoietic tumor cells, particularly melanoma and breast cancer. AT1413 immune precipitated CD43s from melanoma cells confirming that it recognizes the same target on melanoma as on AML. AT1413 induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against short-term cultured patient-derived melanoma samples. However, AT1413 was unable to affect the growth of melanoma cells in vivo. To increase the efficacy of AT1413 as a therapeutic antibody, we generated two different formats of bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies (TCEs): one binding bivalently (bTCE) and the other monovalently (knob-in-hole; KiH) to both CD43s and CD3epsilon. In vitro, these TCEs redirected T-cell cytotoxicity against melanoma cells with differences in potencies. To investigate their effects in vivo, we grafted mice that harbor a human immune system with the melanoma cell line A375. Treatment with both AT1413 bTCE and AT1413 KiH significantly reduced tumor outgrowth in these mice. These data indicate a broad therapeutic potential of AT1413 that includes AML and CD43s-expressing solid tumors that originate from CD43-negative tissues.",,"['de Jong, G', 'Bartels, L', 'Kedde, M', 'Verdegaal, E M E', 'Gillissen, M A', 'Levie, S E', 'Cercel, M G', 'van Hal-van Veen, S E', 'Fatmawati, C', 'van de Berg, D', 'Yasuda, E', 'Claassen, Y B', 'Bakker, A Q', 'van der Burg, S H', 'Schotte, R', 'Villaudy, J', 'Spits, H', 'Hazenberg, M D', 'van Helden, P M', 'Wagner, K']","['de Jong G', 'Bartels L', 'Kedde M', 'Verdegaal EME', 'Gillissen MA', 'Levie SE', 'Cercel MG', 'van Hal-van Veen SE', 'Fatmawati C', 'van de Berg D', 'Yasuda E', 'Claassen YB', 'Bakker AQ', 'van der Burg SH', 'Schotte R', 'Villaudy J', 'Spits H', 'Hazenberg MD', 'van Helden PM', 'Wagner K']","['AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute (AI&II), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute (AI&II), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Oncode Institute, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute (AI&II), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Oncode Institute, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute (AI&II), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute (AI&II), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. pmvanhelden@aimmtherapeutics.com.', 'AIMM Therapeutics, Meibergdreef 59, 1105 BA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201123,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antibody immunotherapy', 'Bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies', 'Breast cancer', 'Hematological cancers/leukemias', 'Post-translationally modified drug target', 'Skin cancers/melanoma']",,2020/11/24 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2020/11/23 05:43'],"['2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/23 05:43 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2021 Jun;70(6):1569-1581. doi: 10.1007/s00262-020-02780-9.

Thus, in this study, we established MSTN knockout (KO) quail myoblasts (QM7) and investigated the regulatory pathway of the myogenic differentiation process. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to generate MSTN KO QM7 cells and subsequently isolated a single cell-derived MSTN KO QM7 subline with 10- and 16-nucleotide deletions that induced translational frameshift mutations. The differentiation capacity and proliferation rate of MSTN KO QM7 cells were enhanced. We conducted next-generation-sequencing (NGS) analysis to compare the global gene expression profiles of wild-type (WT) QM7 and MSTN KO QM7 cells. Intriguingly, NGS expression profiles showed different expression patterns of p21 and p53 in MSTN KO QM7 cells. Moreover, we identified downregulated expression patterns of leukemia inhibitory factor and DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4, which are genes in the p53 signaling pathway. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and western blotting, we concluded that p53-related genes promote the cell cycle by upregulating p21 and enhancing muscle differentiation in MSTN KO QM7 cells.

However, it cannot be considered as a valuable drug candidate due to its high polarity that limits its permeability across the human intestinal mucosa. When the ribose phosphate group of adefovir is replaced by the isopolar phosphonomethyl ether functionality, it neutralizes the negative charge of the drug. This makes the drug lipid-soluble and potent to diffuse across the cell membrane. The prodrug adefovir dipivoxil is regarded as a potent antiviral drug against hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The correlation between the structure and the dynamics of adefovir dipivoxil is determined by measuring the principal components of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor, site-specific spin-lattice relaxation time, and molecular correlation time at crystallographically different carbon nuclei sites. The CSA parameters, spin-lattice relaxation time, and molecular correlation time of phosphorous nucleus of the organophosphate group of adefovir dipivoxil molecule are also determined. The spin-lattice relaxation time of carbon nuclei varies from 1 to 107 s. The range of molecular correlation time also varies from 10(-4) to 10(-8) s. These remarkable diversities of motional dynamics of the molecules imply that there exist various motional degrees of freedom within this valuable drug and these motional degrees of freedom are independent of each other, which may be the reason for the biological activities exhibited by the drug. The correlation between structure and dynamics of such an important antiviral drug adefovir dipivoxil can be visualized by these types of extensive spectroscopic measurements, which will enlighten the path of inventing advanced medicine in the pharmaceutical industry, and it will also illuminate the understanding of the structure-activity relationships of antiviral drug.",['(c) 2020 American Chemical Society.'],"['Dey, Krishna Kishor', 'Ghosh, Manasi']","['Dey KK', 'Ghosh M']","['Department of Physics, Dr. Harisingh Gour Central University, Sagar, 470003 MP, India.', 'Physics Section, MMV, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005 UP, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201104,United States,ACS Omega,ACS omega,101691658,PMC7676337,,,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],2020/11/24 06:00,2020/11/24 06:01,['2020/11/23 05:42'],"['2020/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,ACS Omega. 2020 Nov 4;5(45):29373-29381. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.0c04205. eCollection 2020 Nov 17.,,10.1021/acsomega.0c04205 [doi],,,,['10.1021/acsomega.0c04205 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, among the various underlying disorders of DIC, the clinical presentations of bleeding or organ failure have not to date been well documented. The present study aimed to evaluate whether underlying disorders of DIC would affect clinical outcome including death, organ failure, and bleeding. Methods: Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database, we identified all adult patients diagnosed with DIC during hospitalization from July 1, 2010, to March 31, 2018. We collected data on patient characteristics and underlying disorders of DIC including sepsis, solid cancer, leukemia, trauma, obstetric diseases, aortic diseases, pancreatitis, and miscellaneous diseases. We counted major bleeding events and calculated an organ failure score for patients during hospitalization. Results: We identified 337,132 patients with DIC. The major disorders underlying DIC were sepsis (42%) and solid cancer (31%). The average organ failure scores of patients with aortic diseases, sepsis, and trauma were 2.8, 2.2, and 2.2, respectively. The percentages with major bleeding events among patients with aortic diseases, trauma, obstetric diseases, and solid cancer were 24%, 15%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the clinical presentations of bleeding and organ failure are not associated with the three existing clinical phenotypes of DIC or with the underlying disorders of DIC. Therefore, clinical presentation alone may not be sufficient for identifying the clinical phenotypes of DIC.

This study aimed to investigate the temporal trend in mortality, patient outcomes, and treatment preferences of several anticoagulants in Japan. Methods: This retrospective observational study used the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database, which contains data from more than 1200 acute-care hospitals in Japan. We identified all adult patients that were diagnosed with DIC from July 2010 to March 2018 and sorted them into one of five predefined underlying conditions: sepsis, solid cancer, leukemia, trauma, or obstetric. The data collected as general outcomes were the 28-day mortality and major bleeding events. We also evaluated anticoagulant use for DIC treatment. Results: A total of 325,327 DIC patients were included in this study. Regarding the baseline characteristics, an increase in median age, worsened comorbid conditions, and higher illness severity were observed over time. The underlying conditions for DIC were largely unchanged. Over the study period, the 28-day mortality for overall DIC patients decreased from 41.8% (95% CI 41.2%-42.3%) to 36.1% (95% CI 35.6%-36.6%), which is a 14% decrease over the 8-year period (P trend < 0.001). The downward trend in mortality was more evident in patients with sepsis and leukemia (15% and 14% decreases, respectively), whereas no clinically meaningful change in mortality occurred in trauma and obstetrics patients. Over time, major bleeding events modestly increased, and the length of hospital stay decreased. The temporal trend in the treatment preferences of anticoagulants for DIC patients clearly changed over time. Conclusions: The overall 28-day mortality for DIC patients clearly decreased from 2010 to 2017.

However, the impact of ATAC-seq on cancer biology has not been objectively analyzed. We categorized 440 ATAC-seq publications according to the publication date, type, field, and country. R 3.6.2 was used to analyze the distribution of research fields. VOSviewer was used for country co-authorship and author co-authorship analyses, and GraphPad Prism 8 was used for correlation analyses of the factors that may affect the number of articles published in different countries. We found that ATAC-seq plays roles in carcinogenesis, anticancer immunity, targeted therapy, and metastasis risk predictions and is most frequently used in studies of leukemia among all types of cancer. We found a significantly strong correlation between the top 10 countries in terms of the number of publications and the gross expenditure on research and development (R&D), the number of universities, and the number of researchers. At present, ATAC-seq technology is undergoing a period of rapid development, making it inseparable from the emphasis and investment in scientific research by many countries. Collectively, ATAC-seq has advantages in the study of the cancer mechanisms because it can detect nucleic acids and thus has good application prospects in the field of cancer, especially in leukemia studies. As a country's economic strength increases and the emphasis on scientific research deepens, ATAC-seq will definitely play a more significant role in the field of cancer biology.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhao, Zhang, Song, Wei, Wang, Chen, Sun, Ma and Chen.']","['Zhao, Yu', 'Zhang, Xianwen', 'Song, Zhenhua', 'Wei, Danian', 'Wang, Hong', 'Chen, Wei', 'Sun, Guodong', 'Ma, Weiying', 'Chen, Kebing']","['Zhao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Song Z', 'Wei D', 'Wang H', 'Chen W', 'Sun G', 'Ma W', 'Chen K']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bone and Joint Degeneration Disease, Department of Treatment Center for Traumatic Injuries, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Academy of Orthopedics of Guangdong Province), Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bone and Joint Degeneration Disease, Department of Treatment Center for Traumatic Injuries, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Academy of Orthopedics of Guangdong Province), Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bone and Joint Degeneration Disease, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Academy of Orthopedics of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bone and Joint Degeneration Disease, Department of Musculoskeletal Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Academy of Orthopedics of Guangdong Province), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bone and Joint Degeneration Disease, Department of Spine Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Academy of Orthopedics of Guangdong Province), Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Systematic Review'],20201103,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,PMC7670091,['NOTNLM'],"['ATAC-seq', 'bibliometric analysis', 'cancer biology', 'leukemia', 'open chromatin']",,2020/11/24 06:00,2020/11/24 06:01,['2020/11/23 05:41'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2020 Nov 3;7:584728. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2020.584728. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fmed.2020.584728 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fmed.2020.584728 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adverse cytogenetic or molecular risk factors, as well as refractory disease or persistent measurable residual disease (MRD) at the time of transplantation are associated with an increased risk of recurrence. Salvage therapy for AML relapse after allo-HSCT is often limited to chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusions and/or second transplants and is rarely successful. Effective post-transplant preventive intervention in high risk AML may be crucial. The most frequent and promising approach is the use of post-transplant maintenance with hypomethylating agents or with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the target is present. Moreover, IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors in combination with other strategies are promising approaches in the maintenance setting. Here we summarize the current knowledge about the preemptive and prophylactic use of pharmacologic agents after allo-HSCT to prevent relapse of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Antar, Otrock, Abou Dalle, El-Cheikh and Bazarbachi.']","['Antar, Ahmad I', 'Otrock, Zaher K', 'Abou Dalle, Iman', 'El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Antar AI', 'Otrock ZK', 'Abou Dalle I', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Almoosa Specialist Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hammoud Hospital University Medical Center, Saida, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, United States.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201102,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7667262,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic', 'hypomethylating agents', 'prevention', 'relapse', 'stem cell transplantation']",,2020/11/24 06:00,2020/11/24 06:01,['2020/11/23 05:40'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 05:40 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 2;10:596134. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.596134. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.596134 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.596134 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His full blood count showed leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were positive. A bone marrow aspirate test showed results consistent with AML (FAB class M1). A diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome secondary to AML characterized by coronary artery embolism, pulmonary embolism and left leg DVT was eventually established.

However, recently, its over expression is been documented in cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). WT1 mutations is found in about 6%-15% of cases of AML affecting mainly hotspot exon 7 and 9, and less frequently in other exon such as 1, 2, 3, and 8. Different studies have shown equivocal findings with few of them depicting poorer prognosis, while others suggesting lack of any significant clinical impact. OBJECTIVE: This study was planned to evaluate prevalence of WT1 gene mutation on exon 7 & 9 in de novo cases of AML and its correlation with their clinical features and disease course. METHODOLOGY: A total of newly diagnosed and treatment naive 100 cases of AML, having blast count of >/=20% in peripheral blood or bone marrow were enrolled. Genomic DNA of all participants was extracted from blood/bone marrow sample using Qiagen((R)) DNA extraction kit. Haematological workup for counts and flow cytometry based immunophenotypes was done. Mutation on exon 7 & 9 were detected with the help of Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: WT1 mutations were detected in both types of cases having normal vs. abnormal cytogenetics. The overall prevalence of WT1 mutation of 2% was found. We have reported one novel mutation on exon 9 of WT1 gene. Twelve cases (12%) among all analyzed AMLs were found to have synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) on exon 7 which has been previously reported in SNP database (rs16754). CONCLUSION: In our study, presence of synonymous SNP was not associated with any change at protein level. We also evaluated mutational status with deaths during induction remission and concluded that presence of WT1 gene mutation was associated with death during induction therapy.",['AJBR Copyright (c) 2020.'],"['Haider, Imran', 'Kumar, Chandan', 'Jain, Garima', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Ranjan, Amar', 'Tanwar, Pranay']","['Haider I', 'Kumar C', 'Jain G', 'Bakhshi S', 'Kumar L', 'Chopra A', 'Ranjan A', 'Tanwar P']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.

Best results have been observed in a few patients who were successfully transplanted after returning to chronic phase. Recent studies focus on the combination of chemotherapy with imatinib, but results remain unsatisfactory. Since dasatinib induces deeper and faster responses, a reasonable strategy might be to combine it with chemotherapy, taking into account the alterations in T-cell response induced by dasatinib. However, there are no published studies or case reports supporting the use of dasatinib as first line treatment for initial myeloid BC, and very little is known about infectious complications associated with this drug.

The author wanted to know the induction-related mortality and treatment-related mortality in the acute leukemia patients at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico. Also the author is interested in finding out the micro-organism and the main site of infection to make some changes in the management of patients in these clinics. Primary objective was induction chemotherapy-related mortality and treatment-related mortality. Secondary objective was to determine the site of infection, micro-organism, type of chemotherapy related with more mortality and relapse mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective case-series analysis of all patients who were admitted to the INCan Acute Leukemia Clinic between January 2012 and December 2015 with febrile neutropenic complications. We reviewed the case histories of all patients, including those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), acute biphenotypic leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia, regardless of disease status (newly diagnosed or relapsed) at the time of clinic attendance. Patients who died as the result of an infectious complication during the analysis window were identified, and their demographics, disease characteristics, treatment history (chemotherapy within 45 days of date of death) and details of the infectious complication resulting in death were collected. Results: Of the 313 patients studied during that time period, 84 (27%) died as a result of infectious complications. Lung infections were the most common, accounting for 67% of all deaths from infectious complications. Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was the most frequently isolated infectious organism (12 patients; 14%). The majority of deaths occurred during either induction therapy (27 patients; 32%) or treatment for a first relapse (25 patients; 30%). Hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) was the chemotherapy regimen most commonly received within 45 days prior to death (17 patients; 20%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest a need for long-term management and supportive care to prevent infectious complication-associated fatalities during both initial chemotherapy and subsequent disease relapse in patients with acute leukemia. The use of prophylaxis will help patients to prevent complications.","['Copyright 2020, Torres-Flores et al.']","['Torres-Flores, Jorge', 'Espinoza-Zamora, Ramiro', 'Garcia-Mendez, Jorge', 'Cervera-Ceballos, Eduardo', 'Sosa-Espinoza, Alejandro', 'Zapata-Canto, Nidia']","['Torres-Flores J', 'Espinoza-Zamora R', 'Garcia-Mendez J', 'Cervera-Ceballos E', 'Sosa-Espinoza A', 'Zapata-Canto N']","['Hematology Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hematology Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Teaching Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Teaching Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hematology Department, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Mexico (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201106,Canada,J Hematol,Journal of hematology,101635099,PMC7665858,['NOTNLM'],"['Bacteremia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Febrile neutropenia', 'Infections', 'Leukemia', 'Neutropenia', 'Prophylaxis']",['The authors have no potential conflict of interest to disclose.'],2020/11/24 06:00,2020/11/24 06:01,['2020/11/23 05:38'],"['2020/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Hematol. 2020 Dec;9(4):123-131. doi: 10.14740/jh751.

In studies from literature, we see that different parameters are examined to determine the prognosis of CLL. The main purpose of our study is to determine the relationship of lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) value in CLL, which has been previously shown to be a prognostic factor in various solid organ tumors and some hematological malignancies. Methods: A total of 173 patients who were followed up between 2005 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnostic age, gender, laboratory, absolute lymphocyte and monocyte count, LMR and overall survival (OS), treatment and responses, recurrence, cytogenetic subtype and mortality rates were examined. Results: The median LMR was 26.7 and it was considered as cut-off value of 26. A positive correlation was found between LMR and Rai Stage. LMR was significantly higher in patients who have an indication for treatment or who died. Conclusions: In our study, in CLL, LMR has been shown to be over 26 in advanced stages, in relapse or with indication of a treatment. With the increase of LMR, it was found that survival and disease-free gap decreased.","['Copyright 2020, Yokus et al.']","['Yokus, Osman', 'Saglam, Esma Nur', 'Goze, Hasan', 'Sametoglu, Fettah', 'Serin, Istemi']","['Yokus O', 'Saglam EN', 'Goze H', 'Sametoglu F', 'Serin I']","['Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201001,Canada,J Hematol,Journal of hematology,101635099,PMC7665864,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Lymphocyte/monocyte ratio', 'Overall survival', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-free survival']",['None to declare.'],2020/11/24 06:00,2020/11/24 06:01,['2020/11/23 05:38'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Hematol. 2020 Dec;9(4):116-122. doi: 10.14740/jh730.

In this retrospective study, we evaluate interest of early and systematic support in the intensive care unit (ICU) for AML with hyperleukocytosis (AML-HL) at diagnosis. Methods: Patients with AML-HL, defined by WBC > 50 x 10(9)/L, primary referred in ICU (""Early ICU"") without organ failure and before initiating chemotherapy induction were compared to patients first admitted in the Hematology Department who required a secondary transfer in ICU (""Late ICU"") or not (""No ICU""). Primary end point was mortality during the first month, and secondary end points were the use of life-sustaining therapies in ICU and risk factors for ICU transfer and mortality. Results: One hundred fifty-four patients were included: 77 (50%) to the group ""No ICU"", 18 (12%) to ""Late ICU"" and 59 (38%) to ""Early ICU"". Mortality at day 30 was higher in ""Late ICU"" than in ""Early ICU"" and ""No ICU"", with 27.8%; 16.9% and 2.6% respectively (P < 0.001). ""Late ICU"" patients had an increased use of life-sustaining therapy comparing to ""Early ICU"" patients (56% vs. 29%, P = 0.04).

Recent advances in immunotherapy offer hope for these patients with incurable GBM. Our present review aimed to provide an overview of immunotherapy for GBM, especially chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy. CAR T-cell immunotherapy, which involves the engineering of T cells to kill tumors by targeting cell surface-specific antigens, has been successful in eliminating B-cell leukemia by targeting CD19. IL-13Ralpha2, EGFRvIII, and HER2-targeted CAR T cells have shown significant clinical efficacy and safety in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials conducted in patients with GBM; these findings support the need for further studies to examine if this therapy can ultimately benefit this patient group. However, local physical barriers, high tumor heterogeneity, and antigen escape make the use of CAR T therapy, as a treatment for GBM, challenging. The potential directions for improving the efficacy of CAR T in GBM are to combine the existing traditional therapies and the construction of multi-target CAR T cells.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Li, Zhu, Qian, Yuan, Ding, Hu, He and Wu.']","['Li, Long', 'Zhu, Xiqun', 'Qian, Yu', 'Yuan, Xiangling', 'Ding, Yi', 'Hu, Desheng', 'He, Xin', 'Wu, Yuan']","['Li L', 'Zhu X', 'Qian Y', 'Yuan X', 'Ding Y', 'Hu D', 'He X', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Hubei Cancer Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201103,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7669545,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T', '*brain tumor', '*chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy', '*glioblastoma', '*immunotherapy']",,2020/11/24 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/11/23 05:37'],"['2020/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Nov 3;11:594271. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.594271. eCollection 2020.,20210623,10.3389/fimmu.2020.594271 [doi],"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Glioblastoma/etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods/trends', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.594271 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While direct on-paper imaging has been considered challenging, paper substrate offers a strong potential to simplify such reagent/dye addition and rinsing. In this work, three-layer paper-based device is developed to automate such reagent/dye addition and rinsing via capillary action, as well as separating white blood cells (WBCs) from whole blood samples. Direct onpaper imaging is demonstrated using a commercial microscope attachment to a smartphone coupled with a blue LED and 500 nm long pass optical filter. Image analysis is accomplished using an original MATLAB code, to evaluate the total WBC count, as well as differential WBC count, i.e., granulocytes (primarily neutrophils) vs. agranulocytes (primarily lymphocytes). Only a finger-prick of whole blood is required for this assay. The total assay time from finger-prick to data collection is under five minutes. Comparison with a hemocytometry-based manual counting corroborates the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Recently, germline missense variants in ABL1 have been found to cause an autosomal dominant developmental syndrome with congenital heart disease, skeletal malformations and characteristic facies. Here, we describe a series of six new unrelated individuals with heterozygous missense variants in ABL1 (including four novel variants) identified via whole exome sequencing. All the affected individuals in this series recapitulate the phenotype of the ABL1 developmental syndrome and additionally we affirm that hearing impairment is a common feature of the condition. Four of the variants cluster in the myristoyl-binding pocket of ABL1, a region critical for auto-inhibitory regulation of the kinase domain. Bio-informatic analysis of transcript-wide conservation and germline/somatic variation reveals that this pocket region is subject to high missense constraint and evolutionary conservation. Functional work to investigate ABL1 kinase activity in vitro by transient transfection of HEK293T cells with variant ABL1 plasmid constructs revealed increased phosphorylation of ABL1-specific substrates compared to wild-type. The increased tyrosine kinase activity was suppressed by imatinib treatment.

Our study aimed to evaluate trends in childhood cancer epidemiology of patients aged 0-14 years in the period 1994-2016 in the Czech Republic. METHODS: Data on childhood cancers have been obtained from the Czech National Cancer Registry. These data were validated using the clinical database of childhood cancer patients and combined with data from death certificates. Incidence and mortality trends were assessed by the joinpoint regression method. The life tables method was used to calculate the overall age-standardised five-year survival. RESULTS: The incidence trend was stable; the age-standardised (world) cancer incidence - ASR (W) - was 173.7 per 1 million children in the period 1994-2016. However, there was apparent significant decrease in mortality: ASR (W) dropped from 58.1 per 1 million children in 1994 to 21.4 per 1 million children in 2016. The overall five-year survival increased over time by 10 %. Statistically significant improvements in survival were observed in patients with lymphoid leukaemia, astrocytomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. CONCLUSION: Such a relevant increase in survival rates, and therefore also a decrease in mortality rates in the Czech Republic, is most likely due to improvements in diagnostic and treatment methods since the 1990s, which were facilitated by the concentration of childhood cancer patients in children's cancer centres.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we assess characteristics, prognostic factors and long-term survival in patients >/=60 years who were treated for AML at our center over the past 17 years. METHODS: 590 older adults with newly diagnosed AML were characterized according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk, type of therapy, serum ferritin (SF) and further baseline characteristics. Survival analysis was performed accordingly. RESULTS: Median age was 68 years and most patients were in good general condition. Median follow-up was 55.8 months. Of all patients, 66% received intensive chemotherapy (IC) +/- allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The remaining cohort received palliative chemotherapy (PC, 26%) or best supportive care only (BSC, 8%). Enrollment rate for interventional clinical trials was 26%. 5-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 18% (median 12.5 months) and 11,5% (median 10.0 months). Long-term survival was independently influenced by ECOG score, ELN risk group, baseline SF, previous myocardial infarction, and choice of therapy, but not consistently by age or CCI. Considering therapeutic subgroups, the contribution of particular parameters in predicting OS was most compelling in IC patients, but less consistent with PC or BSC. CONCLUSION: Our results provide thorough insights into prognostication within therapeutic subgroups and emphasize the need for more detailed prognostic algorithms and routine geriatric assessment in the treatment of older adults with AML.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Its loss or inhibition prompts leukemia stem cells out of self-renewal and into differentiation with ultimate exhaustion of the leukemia pool. We have recently linked the Kat2a requirement in AML to control of transcriptional noise, reflecting an evolutionary-conserved role of Kat2a in promoting burst-like promoter activity and stabilizing gene expression. We suggest that through this role, Kat2a contributes to preservation of cell identity. KAT2A exerts its acetyltransferase activity in the context of two macromolecular complexes, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA) and Ada-Two-A-Containing (ATAC), but the specific contribution of each complex to stabilization of gene expression is currently unknown. By reviewing specific gene targets and requirements of the two complexes in cancer and development, we suggest that SAGA regulates lineage-specific programs, and ATAC maintains biosynthetic activity through control of ribosomal protein and translation-associated genes, on which cells may be differentially dependent. While our data suggest that KAT2A-mediated regulation of transcriptional noise in AML may be exerted through ATAC, we discuss potential caveats and probe general vs. complex-specific contributions of KAT2A to transcriptional stability, with implications for control and perturbation of cell identity.","['Copyright (c) 2020 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

METHODS: We investigated the expression pattern and prognostic value of HOXA5 in patients with AML through by using a series of databases and various datasets, including the ONCOMINE, TCGA, and STRING datasets. The bone marrow samples of 53 newly diagnosed AML patients (non-M3 subtype) and 19 benign individuals were collected in our center. HOXA5 mRNA expression levels were detected by real-time qPCR, HOXA5 protein expression levels were detected by Western Blot. Clinical data was obtained from inpatient medical records. RESULTS: Two microarrays in Oncomine showed that the expression level of HOXA5 was significantly upregulated in AML. Our data revealed that AML patients had higher HOXA5 mRNA and protein expression levels than the controls (P<0.001). The blast percentage in bone marrow of HOXA5 high-expression group was higher that of HOXA5 low-expression group (P<0.05). Higher expression level of HOXA5 revealed a worse OS in AML (P<0.05).

Quality of life (PedsQL), traumatic stress (IES-13) and mental health (SDQ-20) were compared to groups of healthy controls, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and kidney transplanted children (TX). RESULTS: 68 EA adolescents participated. Total scores for PedsQL were not different from the healthy group and ALL patients, but significantly better than the TX patients. The subscale for physical performance was significantly lower than in healthy adolescents, and nine (17%) patients had scores </=70 indicating reduced health status. Five EA adolescents (12%) had mental health scores suggesting a psychiatric disorder, and six (9%) reported high traumatic stress scores with a significant correlation to days on ventilator in the neonatal period. The strongest predictors for quality of life among EA adolescents were self-reported mental health, posttraumatic stress and GERD symptoms.

We aimed to establish whether the clinical and molecular characteristics of the disease at diagnosis are associated with the nature of relapse and subsequent disease course, and whether these associations could inform clinical management. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study we comprehensively surveyed the clinical features of medulloblastoma relapse (time to relapse, pattern of relapse, time from relapse to death, and overall outcome) in centrally reviewed patients who relapsed following standard upfront therapies, from 16 UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group institutions and four collaborating centres. We compared these relapse-associated features with clinical and molecular features at diagnosis, including established and recently described molecular features, prognostic factors, and treatment at diagnosis and relapse. FINDINGS: 247 patients (175 [71%] boys and 72 [29%] girls) with medulloblastoma relapse (median year of diagnosis 2000 [IQR 1995-2006]) were included in this study. 17 patients were later excluded from further analyses because they did not meet the age and treatment criteria for inclusion. Patients who received upfront craniospinal irradiation (irradiated group; 178 [72%] patients) had a more prolonged time to relapse compared with patients who did not receive upfront craniospinal irradiation (non-irradiated group; 52 [21%] patients; p<0.0001). In the non-irradiated group, craniospinal irradiation at relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.68) and desmoplastic/nodular histology (0.23, 0.07-0.77) were associated with prolonged time to death after relapse, MYC amplification was associated with a reduced overall survival (23.52, 4.85-114.05), and re-resection at relapse was associated with longer overall survival (0.17, 0.05-0.57). In the irradiated group, patients with MBGroup3 tumours relapsed significantly more quickly than did patients with MBGroup4 tumours (median 1.34 [0.99-1.89] years vs 2.04 [1.39-3.42 years; p=0.0043). Distant disease was prevalent in patients with MBGroup3 (23 [92%] of 25 patients) and MBGroup4 (56 [90%] of 62 patients) tumour relapses. Patients with distantly-relapsed MBGroup3 and MBGroup4 displayed both nodular and diffuse patterns of disease whereas isolated nodular relapses were rare in distantly-relapsed MBSHH (1 [8%] of 12 distantly-relapsed MBSHH were nodular alone compared with 26 [34%] of 77 distantly-relapsed MBGroup3 and MBGroup4). In MBGroup3 and MBGroup4, nodular disease was associated with a prolonged survival after relapse (HR 0.42, 0.21-0.81). Investigation of second-generation MBGroup3 and MBGroup4 molecular subtypes refined our understanding of heterogeneous relapse characteristics. Subtype VIII had prolonged time to relapse and subtype II had a rapid time from relapse to death. Subtypes II, III, and VIII developed a significantly higher incidence of distant disease at relapse whereas subtypes V and VII did not (equivalent rates to diagnosis). INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that the nature and outcome of medulloblastoma relapse are biology and therapy-dependent, providing translational opportunities for improved disease management through biology-directed disease surveillance, post-relapse prognostication, and risk-stratified selection of second-line treatment strategies.

Previous work has linked endometrial ARID1A loss to endometriosis-related endometrial non-receptivity. Here, we show in mice that ARID1A binds and regulates transcription of the Foxa2 gene required for endometrial gland function. Uterine-specific deletion of Arid1a compromises gland development and diminishes Foxa2 and Lif expression. Deletion of Arid1a with Ltf-iCre in the adult mouse endometrial epithelium preserves the gland development while still compromising the gland function. Mice lacking endometrial epithelial Arid1a are severely sub-fertile due to defects in implantation, decidualization, and endometrial receptivity from disruption of the LIF-STAT3-EGR1 pathway. FOXA2 is also reduced in the endometrium of women with endometriosis in correlation with diminished ARID1A, and both ARID1A and FOXA2 are reduced in nonhuman primates induced with endometriosis. Our findings describe a role for ARID1A in the endometrial epithelium supporting early pregnancy establishment through the maintenance of gland function.",['(c) 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['Marquardt, Ryan M', 'Kim, Tae Hoon', 'Yoo, Jung-Yoon', 'Teasley, Hanna E', 'Fazleabas, Asgerally T', 'Young, Steven L', 'Lessey, Bruce A', 'Arora, Ripla', 'Jeong, Jae-Wook']","['Marquardt RM', 'Kim TH', 'Yoo JY', 'Teasley HE', 'Fazleabas AT', 'Young SL', 'Lessey BA', 'Arora R', 'Jeong JW']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Sciences, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201122,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,PMC8076973,['NOTNLM'],"['*ARID1A', '*FOXA2', '*endometriosis', '*endometrium', '*infertility']",,2020/11/23 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/11/22 20:46'],"['2020/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/22 20:46 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2021 Feb;35(2):e21209. doi: 10.1096/fj.202002178R.

Throughout the Gulf Wars of 1991 and 2003, about 1200 tons of ammunition were dropped around Iraq. After the wars, cancer incidence in Iraq is about 7,000 to 8,000 cancers cases per year, and the overall incidence of lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer has increased twofold and even tripled, as compared to the time before the wars. This increase could result from environmental pollution with radioactive materials including uranium, as cancer can be caused by ionizing radiation. To investigate this hypothesis, uranium concentration in the blood of 64 Iraqi females has been measured by means of CR-39 track etch detectors (42 blood samples collected from females diagnosed with breast cancer and 22 blood samples from females without breast cancer). The results show that the uranium concentrations ranged from 19.1 +/- 0.3 to 238.4 +/- 0.4 with an average value of 94.9 +/- 5.0 ng L(-1) in the blood of women with breast cancer and from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 18.7 +/- 0.04 with an average value of 10.5 +/- 0.1 ng L(-1) in the blood of women without breast cancer. In comparison with the literature data, elevated levels of uranium concentration were recorded in both groups, and significantly higher average uranium concentrations were found in the blood of women with breast cancer as compared to those in the blood samples of women without breast cancer. It is concluded that there is a correlation between the incidence of breast cancer in Iraqi women and elevated levels of uranium concentrations in their blood. Whether this is a casual relationship is unclear, because cancer can be caused by various carcinogens, including environmental pollution in the region.",,"['Ahmed, Rasha S', 'Mohammed, Raghad S']","['Ahmed RS', 'Mohammed RS']","['Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, Al-Nahrain University, Alkadhimiya, PO box 70010, Baghdad, Iraq. rasha.sabeeh.ahmed@colmed-alnahrain.edu.iq.', 'Department of Physics, College of Science, Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201122,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Blood', '*Breast cancer', '*CR-39', '*Environmental pollution', '*Uranium concentration']",,2020/11/23 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/11/22 20:43'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/22 20:43 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2021 Mar;60(1):193-201. doi: 10.1007/s00411-020-00881-8.

Possible dose-response curves for various forms of leukemia are largely based on cohorts of atomic bomb survivors. Animal studies can contribute to an improved understanding of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (rAML) in humans. In male CBA/H mice, incidence of rAML can be described by a two-hit model involving a radiation-induced deletion with Sfpi1 gene copy loss and a point mutation in the remaining Sfpi1 allele. In the present study (historical) mouse data were used and these processes were translated into a mathematical model to study photon-induced low-dose AML incidence in male CBA/H mice following acute exposure. Numerical model solutions for low-dose rAML incidence and diagnosis times could respectively be approximated with a model linear-quadratic in radiation dose and a normal cumulative distribution function. Interestingly, the low-dose incidence was found to be proportional to the modeled number of cells carrying the Sfpi1 deletion present per mouse following exposure. After making only model-derived high-dose rAML estimates available to extrapolate from, the linear-quadratic model could be used to approximate low-dose rAML incidence calculated with our mouse model. The accuracy in estimating low-dose rAML incidence when extrapolating from a linear model using a low-dose effectiveness factor was found to depend on whether a data transformation was used in the curve fitting procedure.",,"['Stouten, Sjors', 'Verduyn Lunel, Sjoerd', 'Finnon, Rosemary', 'Badie, Christophe', 'Dekkers, Fieke']","['Stouten S', 'Verduyn Lunel S', 'Finnon R', 'Badie C', 'Dekkers F']","['Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands. sjors.stouten@rivm.nl.', 'Mathematical Institute, Utrecht University, Utrecht, 3508 TA, The Netherlands. sjors.stouten@rivm.nl.', 'Mathematical Institute, Utrecht University, Utrecht, 3508 TA, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Mechanisms and Biomarkers Group, Radiation Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Didcot, OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Cancer Mechanisms and Biomarkers Group, Radiation Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Didcot, OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.', 'Mathematical Institute, Utrecht University, Utrecht, 3508 TA, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201122,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,PMC7902600,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CBA mice', '*Ionizing radiation exposure', '*LDEF', '*Low-dose', '*Mathematical modeling']",,2020/11/23 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/11/22 20:43'],"['2020/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/22 20:43 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2021 Mar;60(1):49-60. doi: 10.1007/s00411-020-00880-9.

Several attempts have been made to treat non-APL, AML patients by employing differentiation inducers, such as hypomethylating agents (HMAs), and low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) (LDAC), with encouraging results. Other than HMAs and LDAC, various inducers of myeloid cell differentiation have been identified. This review describes and categorizes these inducers, which include glycosylation modifiers, epigenetic modifiers, vitamin derivatives, cytokines, and chemotherapeutic agents. Some of these inducers are currently being used in clinical trials. I highlight the potential applications of glycosylation modifiers and epigenetic modifiers, which are attracting increasing attention in their use as differentiation therapy against AML. Among the agents described in this review, epigenomic modifiers seem particularly promising, and particular attention should also be paid to glycosylation modifiers. These drugs may signal a new era for AML differentiation therapy.","['(c) 2020 S.

Increasing evidence has suggested that cancer-associated EVs in body fluids may assist in the diagnosis and treatment of GC. Here, we investigated the role of GC-derived EVs in PM development. Our results demonstrate that expression of the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is decreased in GC tissues and PM lesions from GC patients. PLZF suppression promoted migration and invasion of peritoneal mesothelial HMrSV5 cells, while PLZF overexpression suppressed HMrSV5 cell migration and invasion. Microarray analysis revealed significantly upregulated expression of several miRNAs in EVs isolated from GC patients with PM, including miR-544. The increased miR-544 expression was confirmed in GC tissues and PM-derived EVs. Transfection with miR-544 reduced PLZF expression in HMrSV5 cells, while miR-544 inhibition increased PLZF expression. Incubation of GC cells with peritoneal mesothelial HMrSV5 cells showed that miR-544 could be transferred from GC-derived EVs to peritoneal cells, where it suppressed the PLZF expression. These findings indicate that EV-mediated transfer of miR-544 decreases the PLZF expression in PM lesions, which suggests miR-544 could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for treatment of GC patients.",,"['Kong, Wencheng', 'Liu, Xinchun', 'Yin, Guang', 'Zheng, Sixin', 'Zhu, Akao', 'Yu, Panpan', 'Shan, Yuqiang', 'Ying, Rongchao', 'Zhang, Jian']","['Kong W', 'Liu X', 'Yin G', 'Zheng S', 'Zhu A', 'Yu P', 'Shan Y', 'Ying R', 'Zhang J']","['Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People&#x2019;s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang Province, P.R.

Like other retroviruses, HIV-2 packages two copies of full-length viral RNA during virus assembly and efficient genome encapsidation is mediated by the viral protein Gag. We sought to define cis-acting elements in the HIV-2 genome that are important for the encapsidation of full-length RNA into viral particles. Based on previous studies of murine leukemia virus and HIV-1, we hypothesized that unpaired guanosines in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) play an important role in Gag:RNA interactions leading to genome packaging. To test our hypothesis, we targeted 18 guanosines located in 9 sites within the HIV-2 5' UTR and performed substitution analyses. We found that mutating as few as three guanosines significantly reduce RNA packaging efficiency. However, not all guanosines examined have the same effect; instead, a hierarchical order exists wherein a primary site, a secondary site, and three tertiary sites are identified. Additionally, there are functional overlaps in these sites and mutations of more than one site can act synergistically to cause genome packaging defects. These studies demonstrate the importance of specific guanosines in HIV-2 5'UTR in mediating genome packaging. Our results also demonstrate an interchangeable and hierarchical nature of guanosine-containing sites, which was not previously established, thereby revealing key insights into the replication mechanisms of HIV-2.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],"['Umunnakwe, Chijioke N', 'Duchon, Alice', 'Nikolaitchik, Olga A', 'Rahman, Sheikh Abdul', 'Liu, Yang', 'Chen, Jianbo', 'Tai, Sheldon', 'Pathak, Vinay K', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Umunnakwe CN', 'Duchon A', 'Nikolaitchik OA', 'Rahman SA', 'Liu Y', 'Chen J', 'Tai S', 'Pathak VK', 'Hu WS']","['Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Mutation Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Viral Recombination Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.

This study aimed to determine the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with TCF3-PBX1 treated with the modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2017, a total of 1051 pediatric patients with ALL were enrolled. TCF3-PBX1 was detected by reverse-transcriptase PCR and/or cytogenetic analysis. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were analyzed and compared in patients with TCF3-PBX1 and with other B-precursor ALL (B-ALL). RESULTS: TCF3-PBX1 was detected in 64 patients with ALL (6.1%), and all were of B-cell lineage. These patients were more likely to express the pre-B-ALL immunophenotype (P < .001), be in the National Cancer Institute high-risk group (P = .030), and exhibit more rapid disease clearance during induction therapy (P < .001) compared to patients with other B-ALL. However, the outcomes of this genotype were not better than those of other patients with intermediate risk. At a median (range) follow-up of 60.6 (0.8-184.5) months, the estimated 5-year overall survival was 85.2 +/- 4.6% versus 88.2 +/- 1.8% (P = .500) and 5-year event-free survival was 76.8 +/- 5.5% versus 83.0 +/- 2.0% (P = .210) for patients with TCF3-PBX1 and those with other B-ALL. After adjusting for other risk factors, reemergent minimal residual disease (MRD) was the most significant poor prognostic indicator for patients with TCF3-PBX1. CONCLUSION: The overall outcome of patients with TCF3-PBX1 was intermediate at our institution. Sequential MRD measurement is important for this genotype. Thus, more efforts should be made to eradicate reemergent MRD to improve prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Rare primitive leukemia cells, so-called leukemia stem cells (LSCs), represent one potential type of resistant cell subpopulation responsible for this dissociation between response and cure. Several LSC targets have been described, but there is limited evidence about their relative utility or that targeting any can prevent relapse. LSCs not only appear to be biologically heterogeneous, but the classic immunocompromised mouse transplantation model also has serious shortcomings as an LSC assay. Out data suggest that the most immature cell phenotype that can be identified within a patient's leukemia may be clinically relevant and represent the de facto LSC. Moreover, although phenotypically heterogeneous, these putative LSCs show consistent phenotypes within individual genetically defined groups. Using this LSC definition, we studied several previously described putative LSC targets, CD25, CD26, CD47, CD96, CD123, and CLL-1, and all were expressed across heterogeneous LSC phenotypes. In addition, with the exception of CD47, there was at most low expression of these targets on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). CD123 and CLL-1 demonstrated the greatest expression differences between putative LSCs and normal HSCs. Importantly, CD123 monoclonal antibodies were cytotoxic in vitro to putative LSCs from all AML subtypes, while showing limited to no toxicity against normal HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors. Since minimal residual disease appears to be a more homogeneous population of cells responsible for relapse, targeting CD123 in this setting may be most effective.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Shb gene deficiency has been found to exhibit pleiotropic effects in different models of leukemia, and consequently, this study aimed to investigate MLL-AF9-induced leukemia in Shb deficiency. Bone marrow cells from wild type and Shb knockout (KO) mice were transduced with the MLL-AF9 gene. Shb KO MLL-AF9 cells proliferated at an increased rate, exhibited altered expression of certain cytokine genes (Kitl, Csf3, IL6, IL1b) and higher expression of cell cycle genes (Ccnd2, Ccne1). Mice receiving Shb KO MLL-AF9 cells showed longer latency without displaying any difference in rates of leukemic cell proliferation, indicating a dichotomy between the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. The mice with Shb deficient MLL-AF9 cells had a lower content of leukemic bone marrow cells allowing elevated normal hematopoiesis, explaining the longer latency. Finally, Shb knockout GFP-positive bone marrow cells showed a higher percentage of cells expressing myeloid markers. The result suggests a role of Shb in the progression of leukemia and that the relevance of the Shb gene is context-dependent as inferred from the differences between the in vivo and in vitro responses. These findings help to obtain an increased understanding of human MLL-AF9 leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

However, information on testing and reporting in community-based clinical settings is scarce. This study from the Connect((R)) MDS/AML Disease Registry aimed to compare the frequency of RS and SF3B1 reporting for patients with LR-MDS, before and after publication of the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) MDS classification criteria. METHODS: Ring sideroblasts assessment and molecular testing data were collected from patients with LR-MDS at enrollment in the Registry. Patients enrolled between December 2013 and the data cutoff of March 2020 were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Among 489 patients with LR-MDS, 434 (88.8%) underwent RS assessment; 190 were assessed prior to the 2016 WHO guidelines (Cohort A), and 244 after (Cohort B). In Cohort A, 87 (45.8%) patients had RS identified; 29 (33.3%) patients had RS < 15%, none of whom underwent molecular testing for SF3B1. In Cohort B, 96 (39.3%) patients had RS identified; 31 (32.3%) patients had < 15% RS, with 13 undergoing molecular testing of which 10 were assessed for SF3B1. CONCLUSIONS: In the Connect((R)) MDS/AML Registry, only 32% of patients with <15% RS underwent SF3B1 testing after the publication of the WHO 2016 classification criteria. There was no change in RS assessment frequency before and after publication, despite the potential impact on diagnostic subtyping and therapy selection, suggesting an unmet need for education to increase testing rates for SF3B1 mutations.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Preliminary screening against mHDAC1 highlighted the N-hydroxy-5-(2-(2-phenylbutanoyl)amino)pyridyl)acrylamide (9 b) as the most potent inhibitor. Thus, we further developed both pyridylacrylic- and nicotinic-based hydroxamates (9 a, 9 c-f, and 11 a-f) and 2'-aminoanilides (10 a-f and 12 a-f), related to 9 b, to be tested against HDACs. Among them, the nicotinic hydroxamate 11 d displayed sub-nanomolar potency (IC50 : 0.5 nM) and selectivity up to 34 000 times that of HDAC4 and from 100 to 1300 times that of all the other tested HDAC isoforms. The 2'-aminoanilides were class I-selective HDAC inhibitors, generally more potent against HDAC3, with the nicotinic anilide 12 d being the most effective (IC50 (HDAC3) =0.113 muM). When tested in U937 leukemia cells, the hydroxamates 9 e, 11 c, and 11 d blocked over 80 % of cells in G2/M phase, whereas the anilides did not alter cell-cycle progress. In the same cell line, the hydroxamate 11 c and the anilide 10 b induced about 30 % apoptosis, and the anilide 12 c displayed about 40 % cytodifferentiation.

E3N is a prospective cohort of French women aged 40-65 years at inclusion in 1990. Cancer data were collected at baseline and updated every 2-3 years. Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between pigmentary traits and sun exposure, and risk of CLL/NHL were estimated using Cox models. With a median follow-up of 24 years, 622 incident cases of CLL/NHL were ascertained among the 92,097 included women. The presence of nevi was associated with CLL/NHL risk: HR for ""many or very many nevi"" relative to ""no nevi"": 1.56 [1.15; 2.11]. Such association with number of nevi appears to be mostly limited to risk of CLL: HR for ""many or very many nevi"": 3.00 [1.38; 6.52]; versus 1.32 [0.94; 1.84] for NHL. Women whose skin was highly sensitive to sunburn also had a higher risk of CLL: HR = 1.96 [1.21; 3.18], while no increase in risk of NHL was observed. Skin or hair color, number of freckles, and average daily ultraviolet (UV) dose during spring and summer in location of residence at birth or at inclusion (kJ/m(2) ) were not associated with CLL/NHL risk. Some pigmentary traits (presence of nevi and skin sensitivity), but not sun exposure, were associated with CLL/NHL.

Our aim was to explore experiences, information and support needs, and decision making of parents with a child with cancer in response to this phase in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Parents of a child with cancer completed a survey at a time when the UK moved into a period of 'lockdown'. An online survey was developed by the research team to capture parents' experiences, information and support needs, and decision making, using closed statements and open text boxes. Descriptive quantitative analyses and qualitative thematic content analysis were undertaken. FINDINGS: One hundred seventy-one parents/caregivers completed the survey. Eighty-five percent were worried about the virus and they were vigilant about the virus (92%) or cancer symptoms (93.4%). For two-thirds (69.6%), hospital was no longer considered a safe place. Eight overarching themes were identified related to the virus: (a) risk of infection; (b) information, guidance and advice; (c) health care provision; (d) fears and anxieties; or related to lockdown/isolation: (e) psychological and social impact; (f) keeping safe under lockdown; (g) provisions and dependence; and (h) employment and income. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to report experiences of parents of a child with cancer during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of parents were worried about SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting the virus to their child. Hospital was no longer perceived to be a safe place, and parents were worried about suboptimal cancer care.

To clarify the molecular basis of KLF4-mediated monocytic differentiation, we performed detailed genetic studies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Here, we report that dihydropyrimidinase like 2 (DPYSL2), also known as CRMP2, is a novel key differentiation mediator downstream of KLF4 in AML cells. Interestingly, we discovered that KLF4-mediated monocytic differentiation is selectively dependent on one specific isoform, DPYSL2A, but not on other DPYSL family genes. Terminal differentiation to the monocytes and proliferation arrest in AML cells induced by genetic or pharmacological upregulation of KLF4 were significantly reversed by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated selective depletion of DPYSL2A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that KLF4 associates with the proximal gene promoter of DPYSL2A and directly transactivates its expression. Together with the unique expression patterns of KLF4 and DPYSL2 limited to the differentiated monocytes in the hematopoietic system both in human and mouse, the identified KLF4-DPYSL2 axis in leukemia cells may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel differentiation therapies for patients with AML.",,"['Noura, Mina', 'Morita, Ken', 'Kiyose, Hiroki', 'Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Nishinaka-Arai, Yoko', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Kamikubo, Yasuhiko', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Noura M', 'Morita K', 'Kiyose H', 'Matsuo H', 'Nishinaka-Arai Y', 'Kurokawa M', 'Kamikubo Y', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. adachiso@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. adachiso@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201120,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC7680118,,,,2020/11/22 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/11/21 05:34'],"['2020/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/21 05:34 [entrez]', '2020/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Nov 20;10(1):20245. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-76951-0.,20210414,10.1038/s41598-020-76951-0 [doi],"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (collapsin response mediator protein-2)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']","['10.1038/s41598-020-76951-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-76951-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proved that epigenetic alterations play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of cancer progression including MDS. However, fewer studies explored the whole-genome methylation alterations during MDS progression. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was conducted in four paired MDS/secondary AML (MDS/sAML) patients and intended to explore the underlying methylation-associated epigenetic drivers in MDS progression. In four paired MDS/sAML patients, cases at sAML stage exhibited significantly increased methylation level as compared with the matched MDS stage. A total of 1090 differentially methylated fragments (DMFs) (441 hypermethylated and 649 hypomethylated) were identified involving in MDS pathogenesis, whereas 103 DMFs (96 hypermethylated and 7 hypomethylated) were involved in MDS progression. Targeted bisulfite sequencing further identified that aberrant GFRA1, IRX1, NPY, and ZNF300 methylation were frequent events in an additional group of de novo MDS and AML patients, of which only ZNF300 methylation was associated with ZNF300 expression. Subsequently, ZNF300 hypermethylation in larger cohorts of de novo MDS and AML patients was confirmed by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR. It was illustrated that ZNF300 methylation could act as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis in MDS and AML patients. Functional experiments demonstrated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic role of ZNF300 overexpression in MDS-derived AML cell-line SKM-1. Collectively, genome-wide DNA hypermethylation were frequent events during MDS progression. Among these changes, ZNF300 methylation, a regulator of ZNF300 expression, acted as an epigenetic driver in MDS progression. These findings provided a theoretical basis for the usage of demethylation drugs in MDS patients against disease progression.",,"['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun',

The canonical model of RB regulation is that cyclin-CDKs phosphorylate and render RB inactive in late G1/S, promoting entry into S phase. Recently, monophosphorylated RB species were described to have distinct cell-cycle-independent functions, suggesting that a phosphorylation code dictates diversity of RB function. However, a biologically relevant, functional role of RB phosphorylation at non-CDK sites has remained elusive. Here, we investigated S838/T841 dual phosphorylation, its upstream stimulus, and downstream functional output. We found that mimicking T-cell receptor activation in Jurkat leukemia cells induced sequential activation of downstream kinases including p38 MAPK and RB S838/T841 phosphorylation. This signaling pathway disrupts RB and condensin II interaction with chromatin. Using cells expressing a WT or S838A/T841A mutant RB fragment, we present evidence that deficiency for this phosphorylation event prevents condensin II release from chromatin.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Importantly, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) expands with aging and obesity, two key risk factors in multiple myeloma disease prevalence, suggesting that BMAds may influence and be influenced by myeloma cells in the marrow. Here, we provide evidence that reciprocal interactions and cross-regulation of myeloma cells and BMAds play a role in multiple myeloma pathogenesis and treatment response. Bone marrow biopsies from patients with multiple myeloma revealed significant loss of BMAT with myeloma cell infiltration of the marrow, whereas BMAT was restored after treatment for multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells reduced BMAT in different preclinical murine models of multiple myeloma and in vitro using myeloma cell-adipocyte cocultures. In addition, multiple myeloma cells altered adipocyte gene expression and cytokine secretory profiles, which were also associated with bioenergetic changes and induction of a senescent-like phenotype. In vivo, senescence markers were also increased in the bone marrow of tumor-burdened mice. BMAds, in turn, provided resistance to dexamethasone-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, illuminating a new possible driver of myeloma cell evolution in a drug-resistant clone. Our findings reveal that bidirectional interactions between BMAds and myeloma cells have significant implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of multiple myeloma. Targeting senescence in the BMAd or other bone marrow cells may represent a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of multiple myeloma. SIGNIFICANCE: This study changes the foundational understanding of how cancer cells hijack the bone marrow microenvironment and demonstrates that tumor cells induce senescence and metabolic changes in adipocytes, potentially driving new therapeutic directions.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Fairfield, Heather', 'Dudakovic, Amel', 'Khatib, Casper M', 'Farrell, Mariah', 'Costa, Samantha', 'Falank, Carolyne', 'Hinge, Maja', 'Murphy, Connor S', 'DeMambro, Victoria', 'Pettitt, Jessica A', 'Lary, Christine W', 'Driscoll, Heather E', 'McDonald, Michelle M', 'Kassem, Moustapha', 'Rosen, Clifford', 'Andersen, Thomas L', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Jafari, Abbas', 'Reagan, Michaela R']","['Fairfield H', 'Dudakovic A', 'Khatib CM', 'Farrell M', 'Costa S', 'Falank C', 'Hinge M', 'Murphy CS', 'DeMambro V', 'Pettitt JA', 'Lary CW', 'Driscoll HE', 'McDonald MM', 'Kassem M', 'Rosen C', 'Andersen TL', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Jafari A', 'Reagan MR']","['Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'The Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Department of Biology, Norwich University, Northfield, Vermont.', 'The Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Molecular Endocrinology & Stem Cell Research Unit (KMEB), Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Odense University Hospital & University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.', 'Clinical Cell Biology, Department of Regional Health Research, Vejle/Lillebaelt Hospital, University of Southern Denmark, Vejle, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cell Biology, Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital - Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. mreagan@mmc.org ajafari@sund.ku.dk.', 'Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine. mreagan@mmc.org ajafari@sund.ku.dk.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Orono, Maine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201120,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC7854508,,,,2020/11/22 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2020/11/21 05:30'],"['2020/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/21 05:30 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Feb 1;81(3):634-647. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-1088.

Over-expression of Mcl-1 in many cancers allows cancer cells to evade apoptosis and contributes to their resistance to current chemotherapeutics. In this study, more than thirty coumarin derivatives with different substituents were designed and synthesized, and their Mcl-1 inhibitory activities evaluated using a fluorescence polarization-based binding assay. The results showed that the catechol group was a key constituent for Mcl-1 inhibitory activity of the coumarins, and methylation of the catechol group led to decreased inhibitory activity. The introduction of a hydrophobic electron-withdrawing group at the C-4 position of 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, enhanced Mcl-1 inhibitory capacity, and a hydrophilic group in this position was unbeneficial to the inhibitory potency. In addition, the introduction of a nitrogen-containing group to the C-5 or C-8 position, which allowed an intramolecular hydrogen bond, was also unfavorable for Mcl-1 inhibition. Among all coumarins tested, 4-trifluoromethyl-6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (Cpd 4) displayed the most potent inhibitory activity towards Mcl-1 (Ki = 0.21 +/- 0.02 muM, IC50 = 1.21 +/- 0.56 muM, respectively), for which the beneficial effect on taxol resistance was also validated in A549 cells. A strong interaction between Cpd 4 and Mcl-1 in docking simulations further supported the observed potent Mcl-1 inhibition ability of Cpd 4. 3D-QSAR analysis of all tested coumarin derivatives further provides new insights into the relationships linking the inhibitory effects on Mcl-1 and the steric-electrostatic properties of coumarins. These findings could be of great value for medicinal chemists for the design and development of more potent Mcl-1 inhibitors for biomedical applications.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Genetic lesions in this gene regulatory network underlie the emergence of the most common childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The initial genetic hits, including the common translocation that fuses ETV6 and RUNX1 genes, lead to arrested cell differentiation. Here, we aimed to characterize transcription factor activities along the B-lineage differentiation trajectory as a reference to characterize the aberrant cell states present in leukemic bone marrow, and to identify those transcription factors that maintain cancer-specific cell states for more precise therapeutic intervention. METHODS: We compared normal B-lineage differentiation and in vivo leukemic cell states using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and several complementary genomics profiles. Based on statistical tools for scRNA-seq, we benchmarked a workflow to resolve transcription factor activities and gene expression distribution changes in healthy bone marrow lymphoid cell states. We compared these to ALL bone marrow at diagnosis and in vivo during chemotherapy, focusing on leukemias carrying the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion. RESULTS: We show that lymphoid cell transcription factor activities uncovered from bone marrow scRNA-seq have high correspondence with independent ATAC- and ChIP-seq data. Using this comprehensive reference for regulatory factors coordinating B-lineage differentiation, our analysis of ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL cases revealed elevated activity of multiple ETS-transcription factors in leukemic cells states, including the leukemia genome-wide association study hit ELK3. The accompanying gene expression changes associated with natural killer cell inactivation and depletion in the leukemic immune microenvironment. Moreover, our results suggest that the abundance of G1 cell cycle state at diagnosis and lack of differentiation-associated regulatory network changes during induction chemotherapy represent features of chemoresistance. To target the leukemic regulatory program and thereby overcome treatment resistance, we show that inhibition of ETS-transcription factors reduced cell viability and resolved pathways contributing to this using scRNA-seq. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a detailed picture of the transcription factor activities characterizing both normal B-lineage differentiation and those acquired in leukemic bone marrow and provide a rational basis for new treatment strategies targeting the immune microenvironment and the active regulatory network in leukemia.",,"['Mehtonen, Juha', 'Teppo, Susanna', 'Lahnalampi, Mari', 'Kokko, Aleksi', 'Kaukonen, Riina', 'Oksa, Laura', 'Bouvy-Liivrand, Maria', 'Malyukova, Alena', 'Makinen, Artturi', 'Laukkanen, Saara', 'Makinen, Petri I', 'Rounioja, Samuli', 'Ruusuvuori, Pekka', 'Sangfelt, Olle', 'Lund, Riikka', 'Lonnberg, Tapio', 'Lohi, Olli', 'Heinaniemi, Merja']","['Mehtonen J', 'Teppo S', 'Lahnalampi M', 'Kokko A', 'Kaukonen R', 'Oksa L', 'Bouvy-Liivrand M', 'Malyukova A', 'Makinen A', 'Laukkanen S', 'Makinen PI', 'Rounioja S', 'Ruusuvuori P', 'Sangfelt O', 'Lund R', 'Lonnberg T', 'Lohi O', 'Heinaniemi M']","['Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70211, Kuopio, Finland.', 'BioMediTech, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70211, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70211, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Turku Bioscience Centre, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, FI-20520, Turku, Finland.', 'BioMediTech, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70211, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'BioMediTech, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland.', 'BioMediTech, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland.', 'A.I.

Moreover, MEL is capable of exhibiting both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic effects. In the normal cells, MEL possesses antioxidant property and has an anti-apoptotic effect, while in the cancer cells it has pro-apoptotic action. We investigated the combined effect of MEL and navitoclax (ABT-737), which promotes cell death, on the activation of proliferation in acute promyelocytic leukemia on a cell model HL-60. The combined effect of these compounds leads to a reduction of the index of mitotic activity. The alterations in the level of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins such as BclxL, Bclw, Mcl-1, and BAX, membrane potential, Ca(2+) retention capacity, and ROS production under the combined action of MEL and ABT-737 were performed. We obtained that MEL in combination with ABT-737 decreased Ca(2+) capacity, dropped membrane potential, increased ROS production, suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BclxL, Bclw, and Mcl-1, and enhanced the expression of pro-apoptotic BAX. Since, MEL modulates autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cancer cells, the combined effect of MEL and ABT-737 on the expression of ER stress and autophagy markers was checked. The combined effect of MEL and ABT-737 (0.2 muM) increased the expression of protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), leading to a decrease in the level of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) followed by an increase in the level of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). In this condition, the expression of ERO1 decreased, which could lead to a decrease in the level of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The obtained data suggested that melatonin has potential usefulness in the treatment of cancer, where it is able to modulate ER stress, autophagy and apoptosis.",,"['Lomovsky, Alexey', 'Baburina, Yulia', 'Odinokova, Irina', 'Kobyakova, Margarita', 'Evstratova, Yana', 'Sotnikova, Linda', 'Krestinin, Roman', 'Krestinina, Olga']","['Lomovsky A', 'Baburina Y', 'Odinokova I', 'Kobyakova M', 'Evstratova Y', 'Sotnikova L', 'Krestinin R', 'Krestinina O']","['Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.', 'Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201118,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,PMC7698880,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60 cells', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'melatonin', 'navitoclax (ABT-737)', 'permeability transition pore']",,2020/11/22 06:00,2020/11/22 06:01,['2020/11/21 01:01'],"['2020/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/21 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/22 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2020 Nov 18;9(11). pii: antiox9111143. doi: 10.3390/antiox9111143.,,E1143 [pii] 10.3390/antiox9111143 [doi],,,,"['antiox9111143 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox9111143 [doi]']",,,,"['20-315-90014/Russian Foundation for Basic Research', '20-34-90061/Russian Foundation for Basic Research', '20-34-90062/Russian Foundation for Basic Research']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CAG/HAG regimen is not often used clinically because heterogenous patient responses, resistance, and hematopoietic bone marrow dysfunction have been reported with its use. We present 2 cases of R/RAML treated with a new combined therapy (venetoclax+ hypomethylating agents [HMAs]) in which the HAG dose was adjusted and effective in the first course of treatment. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Case 1 involved a 23-year-old man who had suffered from AML for >4 years, and his FLT3 mutation status was positive at the initial diagnosis. After the first course of treatment with the standard-dose ""Da"" plan, the patient experienced complete remission. During the subsequent courses of treatment, the patient experienced 6 recurrences and was treated with the ""ID Ara-C + MIT + sidaaniline"" and ""CAG + sidaaniline"" regimens. However, the disease did not respond. Case 2 involved a 26-year-old man who received chemotherapy with the ""Da,"" ""ID Ara-C,"" ""decitabine + half-dose CAG,"" and ""HAE"" regimens. In this patients, remission could not be achieved. Reintroduction of the ""ia"" scheme also failed after treatment in our hospital. DIAGNOSIS: Two patients were diagnosed with R/RAML. INTERVENTIONS: The patient in case 2 received chemotherapy interventions, whereas the patient in case 1 refused to receive medical services at our hospital. OUTCOMES: The patient in case 1 was discharged after complete response treatment due to economic reasons and relapsed 2 months later. The patient ultimately died of infection and heart failure.

This study aimed to evaluate the differential expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) between untreated MDA-MB-231 cells (TNBC cell model) and those that survived photodynamic therapy (PDT) to gain insights into cell survival mechanisms. METHODS: Two PDT cycles were applied to MDA-MB-231 cells, using delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) followed by laser light at 635nm. RNA was obtained from cells surviving PDT and untreated cells. The miRNAs expression profile was analyzed to detect the differences between the two groups. The potential target network of hsa-miR-16 was examined in silico with the integrative database Ingenuity(R) Pathway Analysis software. RESULTS: After the first and second PDT cycles, 17.8% and 49.6% of the MDA-MB-231 cells were viable. Microarray profiling of miRNAs showed decreased hsa-miR-16 expression (p<0.05) in MDA-MB-231 cells surviving PDT when compared to the control cells. The predicted downstream targets of hsa-miR-16 were: 1) tumor suppressor protein 53; 2) molecules related to the cell cycle, such as cyclin D1, D3, and E1, and checkpoint kinase 1; 3) cell proliferation molecules, including fibroblast growth factor 1, 2 and 7 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; and 4) apoptosis-related molecules, consisting of BCL-2, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, caspase 3, and cytochrome c. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression of hsa-miR-16 between untreated MDA-MB-231 cells and those surviving PDT has not been previously reported. There was a lower expression of hsa-miR-16 in treated cells, which probably altered its downstream target network. In silico analysis predicted, a network related to the cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis. These results are congruent with previous descriptions of hsa-miR-16 as a tumor suppressor and suggest that the treated population has increased their capacity to survive.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we analyzed the frequency of MYD88 L265P mutation and its correlation with clinico-hematological profile in mature B-cell neoplasms. METHODS: A total of 110 consecutive cases of B-cell neoplasms showing peripheral blood and/or bone marrow infiltration were included. MYD88 L265P mutation was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of exon 5 of MYD88 gene, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Among the 110 cases, the major group was of CLL (54.5%, n = 60), followed by HCL. Other cases included MCL, LPL, DLBCL, SMZL, NMZL, FL, and BL. MYD88 L265P mutation was seen in 21 (19.1%) cases of B-cell neoplasm, whereas 89 (80.9%) cases were negative for MYD88 L265P mutation. It was most commonly seen in LPL/WM cases followed by HCL, SMZL, CLL, and MCL cases. No case of DLBCL, FL, and BL showed MYD88 L265P mutation. Statistically significant difference was seen for hemoglobin level in CLL cases, with MYD88 L265P mutated cases showing higher mean hemoglobin levels than MYD88 wild-type cases (p = .001). For other parameters, no statistically significant difference was noted between mutated and unmutated cases. CONCLUSION: MYD88 L265P mutation is seen in various B-cell neoplasms; it is most commonly seen in LPL/WM cases but not specific for it.","['Copyright (c) 2020 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Molecular mechanisms for exceptional responses to therapy have been identified by genomic analysis of tumor biopsies from individual patients. Here, we analyzed tumor biopsies from an unbiased cohort of 111 exceptional responder patients using multiple platforms to profile genetic and epigenetic aberrations as well as the tumor microenvironment. Integrative analysis uncovered plausible mechanisms for the therapeutic response in nearly a quarter of the patients. The mechanisms were assigned to four broad categories-DNA damage response, intracellular signaling, immune engagement, and genetic alterations characteristic of favorable prognosis-with many tumors falling into multiple categories.

Using acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acquired resistance to BCL-2 (venetoclax) and MCL-1 (S63845) antagonists, we identify common principles of resistance and persistent vulnerabilities to overcome resistance. BH3 mimetic resistance is characterized by decreased mitochondrial apoptotic priming as measured by BH3 profiling, both in PDX models and human clinical samples, due to alterations in BCL-2 family proteins that vary among cases, but not to acquired mutations in leukemia genes. BCL-2 inhibition drives sequestered pro-apoptotic proteins to MCL-1 and vice versa, explaining why in vivo combinations of BCL-2 and MCL-1 antagonists are more effective when concurrent rather than sequential. Finally, drug-induced mitochondrial priming measured by dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP) identifies drugs that are persistently active in BH3 mimetic-resistant myeloblasts, including FLT-3 inhibitors and SMAC mimetics.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Neurologic abnormalities may not be present on initial evaluation, and delayed diagnosis and treatment is associated with increased risk of permanent paralysis. CASE REPORT: The author describes a case of isolated torticollis in a 2-year-old evaluated multiple times in the emergency department (ED) and outpatient settings. For her first three presentations, the patient had no associated neurologic abnormalities. She was discharged with return precautions and a presumptive diagnosis of viral infection/lymphadenitis. She later developed weakness of her left arm and was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma causing spinal cord compression.

In terms of cost considerations, the cheap native Escherichia coli ASP, the most immunogenic form of this medication, is used in the first line in middle-income countries. Previously, the role of the HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 haplotype had been established to associate with E. coli ASP hypersensitivity. We investigated a possible cost-effective genetic testing method to identify patients harbouring the risk HLA haplotype in order to pave the way for safer ASP treatment. METHODS: In 241 patients with previously determined HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 haplotype and known ASP hypersensitivity status, 4 candidate HLA-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s were measured, and the performance of the different sets of these tag SNPs was evaluated. RESULTS: We identified a combination of 2 SNPs - rs28383172 and rs7775228 - as a tag for HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 haplotype with sensitivity and specificity values >95%. In line with previous findings, we found complete concordance between HLA-DRB1*07:01 and rs28383172. With bioinformatics methods, the results were also confirmed in the 1000 Genomes dataset in different ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: Rs28383172 and rs7775228 are suitable for identifying HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 carriers. Compared to the rest of the population, patients with hypersensitivity-prone genotype would benefit more from the administration of less immunogenic PEGylated ASP before the hypersensitivity evolves, incurring minimal extra cost.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

A total of 67 patients who relapsed after receiving ATO-based up-front therapy and were also salvaged using an ATO-based regimen were evaluated. The median (range) age of patients was 28 (4-54) years. While 63/67 (94%) achieved a second molecular remission (MR) after salvage therapy, three (4.5%) died during salvage therapy. An autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT) was offered to all patients who achieved MR, 35/63 (55.6%) opted for auto-SCT the rest were administered an ATO + all-trans retinoic acid maintenance regimen. The mean (SD) 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival and event-free survival of those who received auto-SCT versus those who did not was 90.3 (5.3)% versus 58.6 (10.4)% (P = 0.004), and 87.1 (6.0)% versus 47.7 (10.3)% (P = 0.001) respectively. On multivariate analysis, failure to consolidate MR with an auto-SCT was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse [hazard ratio (HR) 4.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56-15.41; P = 0.006]. MR induction with ATO-based regimens followed by an auto-SCT in children and young adults with relapsed APL who were treated with front-line ATO-based regimens was associated with excellent long-term survival.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Using phosphospecific flow cytometry, we showed that in leukaemic cells from CLL patients the CD20 therapeutic antibodies - rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab - inhibited BCR signalling pathways targeting preferentially pBTK(Y551) - but not BTK(Y223) - and pAKT. On the contrary, ibrutinib and idelalisib reduced pBTK(Y223) to a higher extent than pBTK(Y551) . The strong reduction of pAKT induced by idelalisib was enhanced by its combination with rituximab or ofatumumab. Moreover, CD20 mAbs and BAKi induced the death of leukaemia cells that was significantly potentiated by their combination. Analysis of the enhancement of cell death in these combinations revealed an approximately additive enhancement induced by rituximab or obinutuzumab combined with ibrutinib or idelalisib. Taken together, our data identified negative regulatory effects of CD20 mAbs and their combinations with BAKi on BCR signalling and cell survival in CLL. In conclusion, this study advances our understanding of mechanisms of action of CD20 mAbs as single agents or in combination with BAKi and could inform on the potential of combined therapies in ongoing and future clinical trials in patients with CLL.",['(c) 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Cavallini, Chiara', 'Galasso, Marilisa', 'Pozza, Elisa Dalla', 'Chignola, Roberto', 'Lovato, Ornella', 'Dando, Ilaria', 'Romanelli, Maria G', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Donadelli, Massimo', 'Scupoli, Maria T']","['Cavallini C', 'Galasso M', 'Pozza ED', 'Chignola R', 'Lovato O', 'Dando I', 'Romanelli MG', 'Krampera M', 'Pizzolo G', 'Donadelli M', 'Scupoli MT']","['Research Center LURM (Interdepartmental Laboratory of Medical Research), University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Research Center LURM (Interdepartmental Laboratory of Medical Research), University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Research Center LURM (Interdepartmental Laboratory of Medical Research), University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201120,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell receptor', '*CD20 mAb', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*leukaemia', '*signal transduction']",,2020/11/21 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/11/20 17:15'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/20 17:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Jan;192(2):333-342. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17139.

Several randomized studies in the current era of oral targeted agents seem to have skipped one step and proceeded directly to combinations with antibodies, omitting the testing of novel-agent monotherapy. Thus, the ibrutinib + rituximab combination was used as the experimental arm in a major trial for untreated fit patients while two other trials subsequently showed that addition of rituximab to ibrutinib does not produce any meaningful benefit. Similarly, two large trials omitted venetoclax monotherapy and proceeded directly to venetoclax + rituximab or obinutuzumab versus chemoimmunotherapy. While such trials are undoubtedly cheaper, quicker and easier to manage, they leave the CLL community with uncertainty regarding the real role of the monoclonal antibody components. Thus, we are left with regimens which are undoubtedly effective, but might actually be unnecessarily toxic and expensive. The solution to this problem is simple: future randomized trials should be carefully designed in a 'step by step' fashion which would provide the CLL community with simple yet robust answers regarding efficacy of novel regimens so that these can be introduced to practice following the best principles of evidence-based medicine.",['(c) 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Smolej, Lukas']",['Smolej L'],"['4th Department of Internal Medicine -Haematology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201120,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*ibrutinib', '*obinutuzumab', '*rituximab', '*venetoclax']",,2020/11/21 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/11/20 12:16'],"['2020/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/20 12:16 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 May;193(4):723-726. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17215.

Though, CYL has been documented to induce lung toxicity. Mechanism of CYL toxicity is through oxidative stress and the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Sesamol (SES) is a natural antioxidant isolated from Sesamum indicum and its effect against CYL-induced lung toxicity is not studied yet. This study aims to investigate whether SES could prevent any deleterious effects induced by CYL on lung using normal human lung cells, WI-38 cell line, without suppressing its efficacy. Cells were pretreated with SES and/or CYL for 24 h, then cell viability was estimated by MTS and trypan blue assays. The mode of cell death was determined by AO/EB staining. Additionally, caspase-3 level, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers were evaluated by colorimetric and ELISA techniques. qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate RAGE, NF-kappaB, and Beclin-1 mRNA-expression. CYL-treated WI-38 cells developed a significantly increased cell death with enhanced oxidative and RAGE/NF-kappab/Autophagy signaling, which were all attenuated after pretreatment with SES.

Objective: To determine whether concurrent use of methotrexate and glucocorticoids is associated with interference with the antioxidant system of the brain and damage and disruption of glucocorticoid-sensitive regions of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2016 to July 2019 in a single pediatric cancer tertiary care center. Participants included survivors of childhood ALL who were more than 5 years from cancer diagnosis, age 8 years or older, and treated on an institutional chemotherapy-only protocol. Age-matched community members were recruited as a control group. Data were analyzed from August 2017 to August 2020. Exposure: ALL treatment using chemotherapy-only protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures: This study compared brain volumes between survivors and individuals in a community control group and examined associations among survivors of methotrexate and dexamethasone exposure with neurocognitive outcomes. Functional and effective connectivity measures were compared between survivors with and without cognitive impairment. The Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, a neurocognitive evaluation in which individuals are asked to copy a figure and then draw the figure from memory, was scored according to published guidelines and transformed into age-adjusted z scores based on nationally representative reference data and used to measure organization and planning deficits. beta values for neurocognitive tests represented the amount of change in cerebellar volume or chemotherapy exposure associated with 1 SD change in neurocognitive outcome by z score (mm3/1 SD in z score for cerebellum, mm3/[gxhr/L] for dexamethasone and methotrexate AUC, and mm3/intrathecal count for total intrathecal count). Results: Among 302 eligible individuals, 218 (72%) participated in the study and 176 (58%) had usable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Among these, 89 (51%) were female participants and the mean (range) age was 6.8 (1-18) years at diagnosis and 14.5 (8-27) years at evaluation. Of 100 community individuals recruited as the control group, 82 had usable MRI results; among these, 35 (43%) were female individuals and the mean (range) age was 13.8 (8-26) years at evaluation. There was no significant difference in total brain volume between survivors and individuals in the control group. Survivors of both sexes showed decreased mean (SD) cerebellar volumes compared with the control population (female: 70568 [6465] mm3 vs 75134 [6780] mm3; P < .001; male: 77335 [6210] mm3 vs 79020 [7420] mm3; P < .001). In female survivors, decreased cerebellar volume was associated with worse performance in Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (left cerebellum: beta = 55.54; SE = 25.55; P = .03; right cerebellum: beta = 52.57; SE = 25.50; P = .04) and poorer dominant-hand motor processing speed (ie, grooved pegboard performance) (left cerebellum: beta = 82.71; SE = 31.04; P = .009; right cerebellum: beta = 91.06; SE = 30.72; P = .004). In female survivors, increased number of intrathecal treatments (ie, number of separate injections) was also associated with Worse Rey-Osterrieth test performance (beta = -0.154; SE = 0.063; P = .02), as was increased dexamethasone exposure (beta = -0.0014; SE = 0.0005; P = .01). Executive dysfunction was correlated with increased global efficiency between smaller brain regions (Pearson r = -0.24; P = .01) compared with individuals without dysfunction. Anatomical connectivity showed differences between impaired and nonimpaired survivors. Analysis of variance of effective-connectivity weights identified a significant interaction association (F = 3.99; P = .02) among the direction and strength of connectivity between the cerebellum and DLPFC, female sex, and executive dysfunction. Finally, no effective connectivity was found between the precuneus and DLPFC in female survivors with executive dysfunction. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that dexamethasone exposure was associated with smaller cerebello-thalamo-cortical regions in survivors of ALL and that disruption of effective connectivity was associated with impairment of executive function in female survivors.",,"['Phillips, Nicholas S', 'Kesler, Shelli R', 'Scoggins, Matthew A', 'Glass, John O', 'Cheung, Yin Ting', 'Liu, Wei', 'Banerjee, Pia', 'Ogg, Robert J', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Phillips NS', 'Kesler SR', 'Scoggins MA', 'Glass JO', 'Cheung YT', 'Liu W', 'Banerjee P', 'Ogg RJ', 'Srivastava D', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Reddick WE', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Now with School of Nursing, University of Texas at Austin.', 'Department of Neuro-oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201102,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,PMC7679952,,,,2020/11/21 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/11/20 12:13'],"['2020/11/20 12:13 [entrez]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2020 Nov 2;3(11):e2025839. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.25839.,20210118,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.25839 [doi],"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cerebellum/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cerebral Cortex/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology', 'Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Executive Function/physiology', 'Female', 'Functional Neuroimaging', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neural Pathways/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Organ Size', 'Parietal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology', 'Sex Factors', 'Thalamus/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']","['2773165 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.25839 [doi]']",,,,"['T32 CA225590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029005/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, delayed MTX clearance may lead to life-threatening toxicities. Administration of supportive therapy for HD-MTX is complex, and insufficient supportive care increases the risk of MTX toxicity. To improve patient safety, we investigated the implementation of a checklist and urine alkalinization protocol in addition to standard supportive care during HD-MTX therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intervention included individualized patient checklists for control of adequate supportive care for every HD-MTX treatment cycle and a urine alkalinization protocol for documentation and guidance during urine alkalinization therapy. The impact of these tools on the rate of adverse events (acute renal injury, delayed MTX clearance) was retrospectively assessed in patients treated from April 2017 to April 2019 (intervention group) and compared with patients treated from January 2015 to March 2017 who received standard supportive care for HD-MTX according to a standard operating procedure (SOP). RESULTS: In total, 118 patients received 414 HD-MTX cycles in the intervention group compared with 108 patients with 332 treatment cycles in the SOP group. Delayed MTX clearance was observed in 2.6% of treatment cycles in the intervention cohort opposed to 15.2% of cycles in the SOP group. The rate of acute kidney injury was also significantly reduced in the intervention group (6.2%. vs. 0.7%). The use of carboxypeptidase as rescue treatment for severe renal impairment and insufficient MTX clearance was necessary in five cases in the SOP group and in only two cycles within the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The use of standardized documentation for supportive care during HD-MTX therapy is recommended to minimize the risk of adverse events. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is a commonly used treatment in several cancer types. Distinct supportive measures are necessary to minimize the risk of HD-MTX side effects, which can be life-threatening. Supportive care consists of certain examinations and interventions before starting HD-MTX and permanent alkalinization of the urine, as this greatly increases the elimination of MTX and decreases the risk of kidney injury. After implementing a checklist for control of supportive care and a urine alkalinization protocol to optimize urine alkalinization, a significant decrease of side effects was observed in comparison to the standard of care; therefore, the use of a safety checklist and alkalinization protocol is recommended for all patients who receive HD-MTX.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: Safety and tolerability were the primary objectives, and clinical outcomes were exploratory. METHODS: A total of 63 patients completed a 15-month phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and were rerandomized 1:1 into an open-label study of nilotinib 150 mg versus 300 mg for 12 months. RESULTS: Nilotinib was safe and tolerated, and no adverse effects seemed to be related to the drug, and no differences in adverse events were observed between groups. Exploratory clinical outcomes showed that nilotinib 300 mg was remarkably stable from baseline to 27 months using partial and total Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale (UPDRS). Nilotinib 150 mg versus 300 mg, significantly declined using partial or the sum of UPDRS Parts I and II. There was no significant difference in nilotinib 150 mg versus 300 mg using UPDRS Part III (on levodopa) and total UPDRS Parts I to III. Subgroup analysis showed that late-start nilotinib 150 mg significantly worsened using the sum of UPDRS Parts II + III and total UPDRS Parts I to III compared with late-start nilotinib 300 mg. Quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire in nilotinib 150 mg significantly declined between 15 and 27 months compared with nilotinib 300 mg, and there was no change in cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that nilotinib is safe and tolerated in Parkinson's disease. The exploratory clinical data will inform an adequately powered larger study to evaluate the efficacy of nilotinib 300 mg in Parkinson's disease. (c) 2020 The Authors.

However, the cell biology of endocrine tissue ageing remains poorly understood. Here, we perform comparative 3D imaging to understand age-related perturbations of the endothelial cell (EC) compartment in endocrine glands. Datasets of a wide range of markers highlight a decline in capillary and artery numbers, but not of perivascular cells in pancreas, testis and thyroid gland, with age in mice and humans. Further, angiogenesis and beta-cell expansion in the pancreas are coupled by a distinct age-dependent subset of ECs. While this EC subpopulation supports pancreatic beta cells, it declines during ageing concomitant with increased expression of the gap junction protein Gja1. EC-specific ablation of Gja1 restores beta-cell expansion in the aged pancreas. These results provide a proof of concept for understanding age-related vascular changes and imply that therapeutic targeting of blood vessels may restore aged endocrine tissue function.

These patients may not be candidates for intensive treatment, and there has been an ongoing need for treatment options for this group. We review the use of glasdegib, a hedgehog-pathway inhibitor available for use in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC).Data Sources: PubMed and relevant congress abstracts were searched using the term ""glasdegib"". In addition, based on our experience with glasdegib, we considered treatment aspects of particular relevance to pharmacists and advanced practitioners.Data Summary: In a randomized phase II study, the combination of glasdegib plus LDAC demonstrated superior overall survival versus LDAC alone (hazard ratio 0.51, 80% confidence interval 0.39-0.67, p = 0.0004). The trial reported adverse events (AEs) of special relevance for older patients, such as hematologic events, gastrointestinal toxicity, and fatigue, as well as AEs associated with Hh-pathway inhibitors (alopecia, muscle spasms, dysgeusia). Educating patients about typical AEs can facilitate adherence as well as early AE identification and proactive management. For LDAC, which is a long-established therapy in AML, various stages of delivery need consideration, with attention to individual circumstances. Practical measures such as dispensing a longer supply can reduce the number of return clinic visits, providing a meaningful difference for many patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists and advanced practitioners play important roles in treatment with glasdegib plus LDAC. Ultimately, framing plans for treatment delivery within the individual circumstances of each patient may enable them to stay on therapy longer, giving them the greatest potential to achieve benefit.",,"['Relias, Valerie', 'McBride, Ali', 'Newman, Matthew J', 'Paul, Shilpa', 'Saneeymehri, Seyyedeh', 'Stanislaus, Genique', 'Tobin, Jennifer', 'Hoang, Caroline J', 'Ryan, Joanne C', 'Galinsky, Ilene']","['Relias V', 'McBride A', 'Newman MJ', 'Paul S', 'Saneeymehri S', 'Stanislaus G', 'Tobin J', 'Hoang CJ', 'Ryan JC', 'Galinsky I']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'The Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Emory University Hospital/Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.', 'Blood Disorders Center, University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Pfizer Oncology, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA.', 'Pfizer Oncology, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20201120,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,PMC8008421,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'glasdegib', 'hedgehog pathway inhibitor', 'low-dose cytarabine']",,2020/11/21 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/11/20 08:39'],"['2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/20 08:39 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Apr;27(3):658-672. doi: 10.1177/1078155220973737.

In 95% of cases, it is always due to the presence of Philadelphia chromosome characterized by the presence of reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. However, in 7% -17% of individuals, extramedullary proliferation also occurs, either in skin, lymph nodes, bone or central nervous system (CNS), which could be either myeloid, lymphoid or mixed progenitor in origin. The present case is of a 23-year-old male who presented with lower limb weakness, bowel and urinary incontinence. His complete blood count (CBC) findings showed a raised white blood count (WBC) of 408 X 10E9/L. Peripheral film, bone marrow biopsy and immunohistochemistry showed findings consistent with CML in chronic phase. Bone marrow cytogenetic revealed the presence of Philadelphia chromosome. Simultaneously, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done which revealed extradural mass at L1-L3 level; histopathological and immunohistochemistry findings showed features compatible with precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology revealed similar blast cells. This extramedullary presence of lymphoid blast cells in the CNS put the patient in the rare entity of CML in blast crisis. He was started on tablet nilotinib and also received multiple cycles of intrathecal chemotherapy with cytosar, methotrexate and hydrocortisone. He also underwent radiotherapy of extradural mass. His lower limb weakness improved dramatically. However, after receiving the fourth cycle of intrathecal therapy, the patient died consequent to neutropenic sepsis. Extramedullary blast crisis in CML has a poor prognosis. Any patient with CML, presenting with CNS symptoms or lymph node enlargement should be thoroughly investigated for extramedullary blast crisis, as there is a considerable change in management and prognosis from the prototype CML in chronic phase.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Mansoori et al.']","['Mansoori, Huma', 'Faraz, Maria', 'Qadir, Hira', 'Rashid, Anila', 'Ali, Maria']","['Mansoori H', 'Faraz M', 'Qadir H', 'Rashid A', 'Ali M']","['Pathology, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Health Sciences, McMaster University, Ontario, CAN.', 'Pathology, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Transfusion Medicine, Regional Blood Centre, Karachi, PAK.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201017,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC7671079,['NOTNLM'],"['blast crisis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'extramedullary']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/11/21 06:00,2020/11/21 06:01,['2020/11/20 05:50'],"['2020/11/20 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Cureus. 2020 Oct 17;12(10):e11009. doi: 10.7759/cureus.11009.,,10.7759/cureus.11009 [doi],,,,['10.7759/cureus.11009 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The safety and efficacy of bosutinib in patients younger than 18 years of age have not been established. We here report the case of a 4-year-old male with CML who was treated with bosutinib during coordination of human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated bone-marrow transplantation because of insufficient responses to imatinib and dasatinib. The patient achieved a complete cytogenetic response immediately after starting bosutinib at 180 mg/day (290 mg/m(2)/day). Because toxicity was tolerable, the dose was increased to 200 mg/day (330 mg/m(2)/day). A complete cytogenetic response was maintained, but a major molecular response was not achieved 6 months after initiation of treatment with bosutinib. At steady state, maximum plasma concentration, minimum plasma concentration, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve were 89.2 ng/mL, 16.7 ng/mL, and 1017.4 ng.hr/mL, respectively, at 290 mg/m(2)/day; and 141.1 ng/mL, 18.9 ng/mL, and 1278.5 ng.hr/mL, respectively, at 330 mg/m(2)/day. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report to show the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib with efficacy and safety in a pediatric patient with CML.

The deubiquitylating enzyme USP18 is a major negative regulator of the IFN signalling cascade and is the predominant human protease that cleaves ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein tightly regulated in the context of innate immunity, from its modified substrate proteins in vivo. METHODS: In this study, using advanced proteomic techniques, we have significantly expanded the USP18-dependent ISGylome and proteome in a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)-derived cell line. USP18-dependent effects were explored further in CML and colorectal carcinoma cellular models. RESULTS: Novel ISGylation targets were characterised that modulate the sensing of innate ligands, antigen presentation and secretion of cytokines. Consequently, CML USP18-deficient cells are more antigenic, driving increased activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and are more susceptible to irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide strong evidence for USP18 in regulating antigenicity and radiosensitivity, highlighting its potential as a cancer target.",,"['Pinto-Fernandez, Adan', 'Salio,

We aimed to identify the efficacy and safety of preemptive interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment in ALL patients who had minimal residual disease (MRD) after allo-HSCT. Multiparameter flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction assays were applied for MRD monitoring. Recombinant human IFN-alpha-2b injections were administered subcutaneously twice weekly in every 4 weeks cycle. Twenty-four (35.3%), 5 (7.4%), 6 (8.8%), and 13 (19.1%) patients achieved MRD negativity at 1, 2, 3, and > 3 months, respectively, after treatment. Seven patients showed grade >/= 3 toxicities after IFN-alpha treatment. The 4-year cumulative incidence of total acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), severe aGVHD, total chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and severe cGVHD after treatment was 14.7%, 2.9%, 40.0%, and 7.5%, respectively. The 4-year cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality after treatment was 31.9% and 6.0%, respectively. The 4-year probabilities of disease-free survival and overall survival after IFN-alpha treatment were 62.1% and 71.1%, respectively. Thus, preemptive IFN-alpha treatment could protect against relapse and improve long-term survival for ALL patients who had MRD after allo-HSCT.

We reviewed the medical records of 3248 patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated in 14 hemato-oncological centers between 2002 and 2018 in Poland. The overall survival (OS) of 1872 children with ALL treated with the ALL IC 2002 protocol was 84% after 3 years, whereas the OS of 1376 children with ALL treated with the ALL IC 2009 protocol was 87% (P < 0.001). The corresponding event-free survival rates were 82% and 84% (P = 0.006). Our study shows that the ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol improved the results of children with ALL compared to the ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocol in Poland.

However, considerable numbers of patients relapse after the treatment, partially due to poor expansion and limited persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that human CAR-T cells polarized and expanded under a Th9-culture condition (T9 CAR-T) have an enhanced antitumor activity against established tumors. Compared to IL2-polarized (T1) cells, T9 CAR-T cells secrete IL9 but little IFN-gamma, express central memory phenotype and lower levels of exhaustion markers, and display robust proliferative capacity. Consequently, T9 CAR-T cells mediate a greater antitumor activity than T1 CAR-T cells against established hematologic and solid tumors in vivo. After transfer, T9 CAR-T cells migrate effectively to tumors, differentiate to IFN-gamma and granzyme-B secreting effector memory T cells but remain as long-lived and hyperproliferative T cells.

It has been designed to display symptom measurement results in different traffic light colors, depending on the severity of a user's symptoms (eg, severe symptoms are presented in red). Therefore, it is easy for users to draw inferences about changes in their symptoms. Further, users can simultaneously set several physical activity goals and monitor their performance. Social support, self-efficacy, and quality of life of a user can also be monitored regularly. This study investigated the usability of this application. An iterative formative test, including a cognitive walkthrough and face-to-face interviews, was conducted. Participants were seven individuals with a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. The ease of use and understanding, acceptability, and usefulness of the application were evaluated. The results revealed that the participants had evaluated ReLive positively. This program could be used as an intervention to deliver health information and manage their performance.

Currently, multi-agent chemotherapy regimens are being used to significantly improve cure rates and achieve complete remissions in BL patients. However, drug resistance can often occur within 6 months in BL patients, contributing to poor prognosis. Mounting evidence suggests that cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR), caused by the interaction between the bone marrow microenvironment and tumour cells may play an important role in drug resistance to chemotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying CAM-DR in BL has not been identified yet. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for CAM-DR in BL cells. We also examined the therapeutic targets of CAM-DR in BL cells and found CD49d and CD49e to be the important adhesion molecules involved. However, CD49a, CD49b, CD11a, CD29, CD18, and CD61 were not found to be associated with CAM-DR in BL cells. Furthermore, we clarified that CD49d- and CD49e-mediated CAM-DR could be attributed to an increase in the expression of B cell leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL) and survivin proteins, and a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), Bcl-2 interacting mediator (Bim) and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) proteins via nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. In addition, bortezomib was found to overcome CAM-DR in BL cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB. Thus, bortezomib may have potential clinical applications in the treatment of CD49d- and CD49e-mediated CAM-DR in BL patients.",,"['Takeda, T', 'Tsubak, M', 'Genno, S', 'Matsuda, T', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Ueda, E', 'Imano, M', 'Satou, T', 'Nishida, S']","['Takeda T', 'Tsubak M', 'Genno S', 'Matsuda T', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Ueda E', 'Imano M', 'Satou T', 'Nishida S']","['Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University School of Medicine, Osakasayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kindai University School of Medicine, Osakasayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Osaka, Japan. nishida@phar.kindai.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201115,Poland,J Physiol Pharmacol,Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,9114501,,,,,2020/11/21 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2020/11/20 05:43'],"['2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/20 05:43 [entrez]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Physiol Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;71(4). doi: 10.26402/jpp.2020.4.02.

Gilteritinib is a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor with activity against ITD and high affinity toward the FLT3 receptor, thereby showing therapeutic potential for relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling donor was performed in a 38-year-old Japanese male with FLT3-ITD positive AML. Neutrophil engraftment (>0.5 x 10(9)/L) was achieved on day 16, and bone marrow remission was revealed on day 32. The patient's AML relapsed hematologically four months after BMT and was resistant to salvage chemotherapy. Gilteritinib was administered and the patient achieved non-remission but 'stable disease' status according to the response criteria. During administration, liver damage was observed but controllable. The patient received cord blood transplantation (CBT) as the second hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) three months after relapse and achieved second remission. There was no evidence of recurrence of AML four months after CBT. This case demonstrates that gilteritinib can control FLT3-ITD positive AML that relapsed early after initial HSCT and can bridge to second HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

The pathogenesis of eAML has been associated with aberrancy of cellular adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors/ligands and RAS-MAPK/ERK signaling. eAML can present with or without synchronous or metachronous intramedullary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) so a bone marrow evaluation is always recommended. Accurate diagnosis of eAML requires tissue biopsy. eAML confined to one or a few sites is frequently treated with local therapy such as radiotherapy. About 75-90% of patients with isolated eAML will develop metachronous intramedullary AML with a median latency period ranging from 4 to 12 months; thus, patients with isolated eAML may also be treated with systemic anti-leukemia therapy. eAML does not appear to have an independent prognostic impact; selection of post-remission therapy including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) is typically guided by intramedullary disease risk. Management of isolated eAML should be individualized based on patient characteristics as well as eAML location and cytogenetic/molecular features. The role of PET/CT in eAML is also currently being elucidated.

The median follow-up for the patients was 102 months. During the follow-up, 24 patients (43%) progressed. Univariate Cox analysis showed that the presence of driver mutations, the accumulation of two or more mutations, the presence of adverse mutations, immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGHV) mutation status and unfavorable single copy number abnormalities (SCNAs) were associated with a higher risk of progression. Particularly, the occurrence of an adverse mutation and unfavorable SCNAs increased the risk of progression nine-fold and five-fold, respectively. Nevertheless, only the occurrence of adverse mutations retained statistical significance in the multivariate analysis. All patients carrying an unfavorable mutation progressed with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 29 months. The accumulation of two or more mutations also increased the risk of progression with a median PFS of 29 months. The median PFS of patients with unfavorable SCNAs was 38 months. Combining mutations and SCNAs, patients may be stratified into three groups with different prognostic outcomes: adverse (17% probability of five-year PFS), protective (86% probability of five-year PFS) and neither (62% probability of five-year PFS, p < 0.001). Overall, the analysis of the mutational status of patients with CLL at an early stage of the disease may allow the identification of patients with a high risk of progression.

Careful molecular monitoring after discontinuation warrants safe and prompt resumption of therapy. We retrospectively evaluated how molecular monitoring has been conducted in Italy in a cohort of patients who discontinued tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment per clinical practice. The outcome of these patients has recently been reported-281 chronic-phase CML patients were included in this subanalysis. Median follow-up since discontinuation was 2 years. Overall, 2203 analyses were performed, 17.9% in the first three months and 38.4% in the first six months. Eighty-six patients lost major molecular response (MMR) in a mean time of 5.7 months-65 pts (75.6%) during the first six months. We evaluated the number of patients who would experience a delay in diagnosis of MMR loss if a three-month monitoring schedule was adopted. In the first 6 months, 19 pts (29.2%) would have a one-month delay, 26 (40%) a 2-month delay. Very few patients would experience a delay in the following months. A less intense frequency of monitoring, particularly after the first 6 months off treatment, would not have affected the success of treatment-free remission (TFR) nor put patients at risk of progression.",,"['Dragani, Matteo', 'Rege Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Berchialla, Paola', 'Dogliotti, Irene', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Cerrano, Marco', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Luciano, Luigia', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Santoro, Marco', 'Giai, Valentina', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Sora, Federica', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Fava, Carmen']","['Dragani M', 'Rege Cambrin G', 'Berchialla P', 'Dogliotti I', 'Rosti G', 'Castagnetti F', 'Capodanno I', 'Martino B', 'Cerrano M', 'Ferrero D', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Crugnola M', 'Elena C', 'Breccia M', 'Iurlo A', 'Cattaneo D', 'Galimberti S', 'Gozzini A', 'Bocchia M', 'Lunghi F', 'Cedrone M', 'Sgherza N', 'Luciano L', 'Russo S', 'Santoro M', 'Giai V', 'Caocci G', 'Levato L', 'Abruzzese E', 'Sora F', 'Saglio G', 'Fava C']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Orbassano, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

Moreover, remissions are frequently short-lived even in the presence of continuous treatment with next-generation FLT3 inhibitors. In this comprehensive review, we focus on molecular mechanisms underlying the development of resistance to relevant FLT3 inhibitors and elucidate how this knowledge might help to develop new concepts for improving the response to FLT3-inhibitors and reducing the development of resistance in AML.

Despite evidence in solid tumors, little is known about protein stability in leukemia. Proteins collected from leukemia cells in blood and bone marrow biopsies must be sufficiently stable for analysis. Using 58 leukemia samples, we initially assessed protein/phospho-protein integrity for the following preanalytical variables: 1) shipping vs local processing, 2) temperature (4 degrees C vs ambient temperature), 3) collection tube type (heparin vs Cell Save (CS) preservation tubes), 4) treatment effect (pre- vs post-chemotherapy) and 5) transit time. Next, we assessed 1515 samples from the Children's Oncology Group Phase 3 AML clinical trial (AAML1031, NCT01371981) for the effects of transit time and tube type. Protein expression from shipped blood samples was stable if processed in </=72 h. While protein expression in pre-chemotherapy samples was stable in both heparin and CS tubes, post-chemotherapy samples were stable in only CS tubes. RPPA protein extremes is a successful quality control measure to identify and exclude poor quality samples. These data demonstrate that a majority of shipped proteins can be accurately assessed using RPPA. SIGNIFICANCE: RPPA can assess protein abundance and activation states in large numbers of samples using small amounts of material, making this method ideal for use in multi-institution clinical trials. However, there is little known about the effect of preanalytical handling variables on protein stability and the integrity of protein concentrations after sample collection and shipping. In this study, we used RPPA to assess preanalytical variables that could potentially affect protein concentrations. We found that the preanalytical variables of shipping, transit time, and temperature had minimal effects on RPPA protein concentration distributions in peripheral blood and bone marrow, demonstrating that these preanalytical variables could be successfully managed in a multi-site clinical trial setting.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

All newly synthesized compounds were tested for antiproliferative activity and interaction with tubulin. Several analogs potently inhibited tumor cell growth. Among the compounds tested, 10-(4-(3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (17c) exhibited excellent growth inhibitory effects on 93 tumor cell lines, with an average GI50 value of 5.4 nM. We were able to show that the strong cytotoxic effects are caused by disruption of tubulin polymerization, as supported by the EBI (N,N'-Ethylenebis(iodoacetamide)) assay and the fact that the most potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth turned out to be the most efficacious tubulin polymerization inhibitors. Potencies were nearly comparable or superior to those of the antimitotic reference compounds. Closely related to this, the most active analogs inhibited cell cycling at the G2/M phase at concentrations down to 30 nM and induced apoptosis in K562 leukemia cells. We believe that our work not only proves the excellent suitability of the acridone scaffold for the design of potent tubulin polymerization inhibitors but also enables synthetic access to further potentially interesting N-acylated acridones.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

PARP1 coordinates BER and relies on the upstream 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) to recognise and excise 8-oxoG. Here we hypothesize that OGG1 may represent an attractive target to exploit reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation in cancer. Although OGG1 depletion is well tolerated in non-transformed cells, we report here that OGG1 depletion obstructs A3 T-cell lymphoblastic acute leukemia growth in vitro and in vivo, validating OGG1 as a potential anti-cancer target. In line with this hypothesis, we show that OGG1 inhibitors (OGG1i) target a wide range of cancer cells, with a favourable therapeutic index compared to non-transformed cells. Mechanistically, OGG1i and shRNA depletion cause S-phase DNA damage, replication stress and proliferation arrest or cell death, representing a novel mechanistic approach to target cancer. This study adds OGG1 to the list of BER factors, e.g. PARP1, as potential targets for cancer treatment.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The prognostic impact of mutant TP53 (TP53mut) variant allelic frequency (VAF) is not well established, nor is how this information might guide optimal frontline therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 202 patients with newly diagnosed TP53-mutated AML who underwent first-line therapy with either a cytarabine- or hypomethylating agent (HMA)-based regimen. By multivariate analysis, TP53mut VAF >40% was independently associated with a significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse (P = .003) and worse relapse-free survival (P = .001) and overall survival (OS; P = .003). The impact of TP53mut VAF on clinical outcomes was driven by patients treated with a cytarabine-based regimen (median OS, 4.7 vs 7.3 months for VAF >40% vs </=40%; P = .006), whereas VAF did not significantly affect OS in patients treated with HMA. The addition of venetoclax to HMA did not significantly affect OS compared with HMA without venetoclax, both in the entire TP53-mutated population and in patients stratified by TP53mut VAF.

IGLV3-21-expressing B cells may acquire a single point mutation (R110) that triggers autonomous BCR signaling, conferring aggressive behavior. Epigenetic studies have defined 3 CLL subtypes based on methylation signatures reminiscent of naive-like (n-CLL), intermediate (i-CLL), and memory-like (m-CLL) B cells with different biological features. i-CLL carries a borderline IGHV mutational load and significantly higher use of IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21. To determine the clinical and biological features of IGLV3-21R110 CLL and its relationship to these epigenetic subtypes, we characterized the immunoglobulin gene of 584 CLL cases using whole-genome/exome and RNA sequencing. IGLV3-21R110 was detected in 6.5% of cases: 30 (38%) of 79 i-CLLs, 5 (1.7%) of 291 m-CLLs, and 1 (0.5%) of 189 n-CLLs. All stereotype subset 2 cases carried IGLV3-21R110, whereas 62% of IGLV3-21R110 i-CLL cases had nonstereotyped BCR immunoglobulins. IGLV3-21R110 i-CLL had a significantly higher number of SF3B1 and ATM mutations and total number of driver alterations. However, the R110 mutation was the sole alteration in 1 i-CLL and was accompanied only by del(13q) in 3. Although IGHV mutational status varied, IGLV3-21R110 i-CLL transcriptomically resembled n-CLL/unmutated IGHV CLL with a specific signature including WNT5A/B overexpression. In contrast, i-CLL lacking IGLV3-21R110 mirrored m-CLL/mutated IGHV. Patients with IGLV3-21R110 i-CLL had a short time to first treatment and overall survival similar to those of n-CLL/unmutated IGHV patients, whereas patients with non-IGLV3-21R110 i-CLL had a good prognosis similar to that of patients with m-CLL/mutated IGHV.

We performed a nationwide study to estimate the incidence and impact of inpatient opportunistic infections. METHODS: The incidence rate (IR) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for Swedish CLL patients diagnosed 1994-2013, and matched controls were calculated, as well as the case-fatality ratio (CFR). RESULTS: Among 8989 CLL patients, a total of 829 opportunistic infections were registered (IR 16.6 per 1000 person-years) compared with 252 opportunistic infections in 34 283 matched controls (IR 0.99). The highest incidence in the CLL cohort was for Pneumocystis pneumonia (200 infections, IR 4.03); Herpes zoster (146 infections, IR 2.94), and Pseudomonas (83 infections, IR 1.66) infections. The highest risk relative to matched controls was observed for Pneumocystis pneumonia (IRR 114, 95% confidence interval 58.7-252). The 60-day CFR for CLL patients with opportunistic infections was 23% (188/821), highest for progressive multifocal encephalopathy (5/7, 71%) and aspergillosis (25/60, 42%). CONCLUSION: We have uniquely depicted the incidence of rare and serious infections in CLL patients and found a relatively high incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia.

In this study, we compared the effects of newborn calf serum (NCS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) on the cryopreservation of mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The isolated SSCs were cryopreserved in two groups: freezing medium that contained 10% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and 10% FBS in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) (group 1) and freezing medium that contained 10% DMSO and 10% NCS in DMEM (group 2). Real-time PCR was performed for stemness gene expression. The SSCs' viability was performed by trypan blue. We observed that the SSCs had increased viability in the NCS-freeze/thaw group (87.82%) compared to the FBS-freeze/thaw group (79.83%), but this increase was not statistically significant (P < 0.105). Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) and Lin28 gene expression levels in the NCS-frozen/thawed SSCs were not significantly different compared to the FBS-frozen/thawed SSCs; however, Nanog gene expression increased considerably, and Dazl gene expression decreased significantly.

However, the clinical use of available effective Mcl-1-specific inhibitors for breast cancer treatment remains a challenge. An RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas13a system targeting RNAs can be used to specifically knock down mRNA expression in mammalian cells. The goal of this work is to develop a self-degradable nanoplatform based on polylysine (PLL)-functionalized black phosphorus (PBP) for the delivery of Cas13a/crRNA complexes to specifically inhibit Mcl-1 at transcriptional level for breast cancer therapy. The constructed Cas13a/crRNA complex is delivered into the cytoplasm by PBP via endocytosis, followed by endosomal escape based on the biodegradation of PBP, and this efficiently knocks down the specific gene at transcriptional level up to an efficiency of 58.64%. Through designing CRISPR RNA crMcl-1, Mcl-1 can be specifically knocked down at transcriptional level in breast cancer cells, resulting in the down-regulation of the expression of Mcl-1 protein and inhibition of the cell activity. Notably, PBP/Cas13a/crMcl-1 shows an excellent tumor suppression efficacy up to 65.16% after intratumoral injection. Therefore, biodegradable PBP is an ideal nanoplatform for the delivery of CRISPR/Cas13a, which could provide a potential strategy for gene therapy.",,"['Yue, Huahua', 'Huang, Ru', 'Shan, Yuanyue', 'Xing, Da']","['Yue H', 'Huang R', 'Shan Y', 'Xing D']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, P.

A nationwide register-based case-control study.,2227-2240,"The aetiology of childhood leukaemia is poorly understood. Knowledge about differences in risk by socioeconomic status (SES) may enhance etiologic insights. We conducted a nationwide register-based case-control study to evaluate socioeconomic differences in the risk of childhood leukaemia in Denmark and to access whether associations varied by different measures of SES, time point of assessment, leukaemia type and age at diagnosis. We identified all cases of leukaemia in children aged 0 to 19 years, born and diagnosed between 1980 and 2013 from the Danish Cancer Registry (N = 1336) and sampled four individually matched controls per case (N = 5330). We used conditional logistic regression models for analysis. Medium and high level of parental education was associated with a higher risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in the offspring, mainly driven by children diagnosed at ages 0 to 4 years [odds ratio (OR) for high maternal education = 3.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44-6.55]. We also observed a modestly increased risk for lymphoid leukaemia (LL) in association with higher level of parental education, but only in children diagnosed at ages 5 to 19 years. Higher parental income was associated with an increased risk of LL but not AML among children aged 5 to 19 years at diagnosis (OR for high maternal income = 2.78; 95% CI: 1.32-5.89). Results for neighbourhood SES measures indicated null associations. Bias or under-ascertainment of cases among families with low income or basic education are unlikely to explain the observed socioeconomic differences. Future research addressing explicitly the underlying mechanisms of our results may help to enhance etiologic insights of the disease.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Given these issues, automation in analysis and diagnosis holds the key to major efficiency gains. The objective was to design an automated pipeline for the diagnosis of B-cell malignancies in flow cytometry and evaluate its performance against our standard clinical diagnostic flow cytometry process. METHODS: Using 3,417 cases of peripheral blood data over 6 months from our 10-color B-cell screening tube, we used a newly described method for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction called UMAP on the raw flow cytometry data followed by random forest classification to classify cases without gating on specific population. RESULTS: Our automated classifier was able to achieve greater than 95% accuracy in diagnosing all B-cell malignancies, and even better performance for specific malignancies for which the panel was designed, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. By adjusting classifier cutoffs, 100% sensitivity could be achieved with an albeit low 14% specificity. Hypothetically, this would allow 11% of the cases to be autoverified without human intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a clinical implementation of this pipeline can greatly assist in quality control, improve turnaround time, and decrease staff workloads.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Methods: Thirty-three children with ALL who were admitted to our hospital between January 2017 and January 2018 were enrolled as the ALL group. The expression of MDM2, LAMP1 and P-gp was compared between the two groups, as well as between ALL patients with different clinical characteristics. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors that affect the prognosis and survival of ALL patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze the correlations of MDM2, LAMP1 and P-gp on the prognosis and survival of ALL patients. Results: The expression levels of MDM2, LAMP1 and P-gp in the ALL group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The average survival time of the group with low expression of MDM2 was (34.92+/-0.56) months, the average survival time of the group with high expression of MDM2 was (31.32+/-0.42) months, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The average survival time of the group with low expression of LAMP1 was (36.71+/-0.55) months, the average survival time of the group with high expression of LAMP1 was (29.87+/-0.40) months, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The average survival time of the group with low expression of P-gp was (36.29+/-0.41) months, the average survival time of the group with high expression of P-gp was (26.46+/-0.37) months, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: Abnormal expression levels of MDM2, LAMP1 and P-gp protein are related to the occurrence and development of ALL, and are closely related to patient prognosis and survival.

MET exon 14 skipping mutations and MET amplifications are associated with potential sensitivity to MET inhibition, though resistance mechanisms are emerging. In MET addicted cells, MET inhibition leads to activation of proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (PIM1). PIM1 and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (SRC) can regulate the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), potentially inducing resistance to MET inhibition through cross-activation. Methods: We evaluated the activity of class I-II MET inhibitors, the SRC inhibitor dasatinib, and pan-PIM inhibitors in four MET addicted cell lines. We assessed the effect of the dual MET/PIM and MET/SRC inhibition on cell viability and at the protein level. We evaluated RNA expression profiles of the cell lines. Advanced NSCLCs were also screened for MET alterations. Results: All cell lines were sensitive to class I-II MET inhibitors. All cell lines were resistant to single PIM and SRC inhibition. Dual MET/PIM inhibition was synergistic or additive in MET amplified cell lines and dual MET/SRC inhibition was highly synergistic in all MET addicted cell lines. The addition of an SRC inhibitor partially prevents the RTKs cross-activation. MET alterations were found in 9 out of 97 evaluable samples (9.3%); median overall survival in MET altered patients was 5 months (95% CI, 3 m-NA). Conclusions: We identified a potential role of PIM inhibition in MET amplified tumors and of SRC inhibition in MET addicted tumors.

We examined data from 202 alloHCT patients reported to have died of MOF from the EBMT registry aiming to determine their exact cause of death focusing on veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) due to its life-threatening, often difficult to capture yet preventable nature. We identified a total of 70 patients (35%) for whom VOD/SOS could be considered as trigger for MOF and leading cause of death, among which 48 (69%) were previously undiagnosed. Multivariate analysis highlighted history of hepatic comorbidity or gentuzumab use and disease status beyond CR1 as the only significant factors predictive of VOD/SOS incidence (OR = 6.6; p = 0.001 and OR = 3.3; p = 0.004 respectively). VOD/SOS-related MOF was widely under-reported, accounting for 27% of deaths attributed to MOF of unknown origin without a previous VOD/SOS diagnosis. Our results suggest most missed cases developed late VOD/SOS beyond 21 days post-alloHCT, highlighting the importance of the newly revised EBMT criteria.",,"['Bazarbachi, Abdul Hamid', 'Al Hamed, Rama', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Halaburda, Kazimierz', 'Labussiere, Helene', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Schroyens, Wilfried', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Schaap, Nicolaas P M', 'Loschi, Michael', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Snowden, John', 'Wu, Depei', 'Guffroy, Blandine', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Chantepie, Sylvain P', 'Poire, Xavier', 'Lopez-Corral, Lucia', 'Nikolousis, Manos', 'Pelosini, Matteo', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Corbacioglu, Selim', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Peric, Zinaida', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi AH', 'Al Hamed R', 'Labopin M', 'Halaburda K', 'Labussiere H', 'Bernasconi P', 'Schroyens W', 'Gandemer V', 'Schaap NPM', 'Loschi M', 'Jindra P', 'Snowden J', 'Wu D', 'Guffroy B', 'Rovira M', 'Chantepie SP', 'Poire X', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Nikolousis M', 'Pelosini M', 'Ciceri F', 'Baron F', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Savani BN', 'Peric Z', 'Nagler A', 'Carreras E', 'Mohty M']","['Sorbonne University, Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Sorbonne University, Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham & Women's, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Sorbonne University, Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'HSCT Unit, SC Ematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'University Hospital Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', ""Service d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 06000, Nice, France."", 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, The Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopitaux Universitaires Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, Institut Josep Carreras, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Caen University Hospital, Hematology Institute, Caen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Saint-Luc University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL; Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University and CHU of Liege, 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-HaShomer, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Josep Carreras Foundation and Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Sorbonne University, Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France. mohamad.mohty@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201118,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,,,,2020/11/20 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/11/19 05:38'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/19 05:38 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Apr;56(4):917-927. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01135-3.

We analyzed 644 s/tAML or de novo AML patients receiving HSCT. s/tAML associated with older age and adverse risk, including higher ELN risk. Overall, s/tAML patients had similar cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), but higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) and shorter overall survival (OS). In multivariate analyses, after adjustment for ELN risk and pre-HSCT measurable residual disease status, disease origin did not impact outcomes. Within the ELN favorable risk group, CIR was higher in s/tAML compared to de novo AML patients likely due to a different distribution of genetic aberrations, which did not translate into shorter OS. Within the ELN intermediate and adverse group outcomes were similar in de novo and s/tAML patients.

However, the same methodology cannot be applied to fusion gene-driven subtypes of AML such as core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML). Here in this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using DNA and RNA sequencing in MRD detection and in tracking clonal dynamics in CBF-AML. Using RNA-seq, we were able to quantify expression levels of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11 at diagnosis and their levels of reduction during remission (P < 6.3e-05 and P < 2.2e-13). The level of reduction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 as measured by RNA-seq and qPCR were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.74, P < 5.4e-05). A decision tree analysis, based on 3-log reduction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and cKIT-D816(mut) at diagnosis, stratified RUNX1-RUNX1T1 AML patients into three subgroups.

On the other hand, although low residual allelic burden was common, it was not associated with long-term outcome, indicating that mutation clearance alone cannot be interpreted as MRD-negative.

Certain external stimuli that trigger reactivation from latency also activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone, but not a GR-specific antagonist, increases the frequency of explant-induced reactivation from latency and stimulates productive infection. Furthermore, dexamethasone increases expression of cellular transcription factors in trigeminal ganglionic neurons: for example, SLUG and three Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) family members, KLF4, KLF15, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). Consequently, we hypothesized that stress-induced transcription factors stimulate expression of ICP4, a viral transcriptional regulator required for productive infection. New studies demonstrated that GR and KLF4, PLZF, or SLUG cooperatively transactivate the ICP4 enhancer upstream of a minimal promoter in monkey kidney cells (Vero) and mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A). Strikingly, mutagenesis of two KLF4/Sp1 binding sites reduced GR- plus KLF4-, PLZF-, or SLUG-mediated transactivation to basal levels. A consensus enhancer (E)-Box adjacent to a KLF4/Sp1 binding site was also required for GR- and SLUG-, but not KLF family member-, mediated transactivation of the ICP4 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (ChIP) revealed GR and stress-induced transcription factors occupy ICP4 enhancer sequences. Conversely, specific binding was generally reduced in the KLF4/Sp1 mutant. Furthermore, GR and SLUG occupancy of ICP4 enhancer sequences was reduced in the E-Box mutant. Based on these studies, we suggest stressful stimuli can trigger productive infection because GR and specific stress-induced transcription factors activate ICP4 expression.IMPORTANCE Certain stressful stimuli activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and increase the incidence of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) reactivation from latency. For example, a corticosteroid antagonist impairs productive infection and virus shedding following explant of trigeminal ganglia from latently infected mice. Infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) is the only immediate early viral transcriptional regulator required for productive infection, suggesting stressful stimuli stimulate ICP4 expression. New studies revealed GR and stress-induced transcription factors identified during reactivation from latency, SLUG and three Kruppel-like transcription factor family members (KLF4, KLF15, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein), cooperatively transactivate the ICP4 enhancer. Two KLF4 consensus binding sites were crucial for cooperative transactivation of the ICP4 enhancer. A consensus enhancer-box also mediated cooperative transactivation of the ICP4 enhancer by GR and SLUG. The ability of GR and stress-induced transcription factors to transactivate ICP4 enhancer activity is predicted to trigger productive infection following stressful stimuli.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Ostler, Jeffery B', 'Thunuguntla, Prasanth', 'Hendrickson, Bailey Y', 'Jones, Clinton']","['Ostler JB', 'Thunuguntla P', 'Hendrickson BY', 'Jones C']","['Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA clint.jones10@okstate.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210128,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC7851558,['NOTNLM'],"['*ICP4 promoter/enhancer', '*KLF4', '*SLUG', '*glucocorticoid receptor', '*stress response']",,2020/11/20 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2020/11/19 05:33'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/19 05:33 [entrez]']",epublish,J Virol. 2021 Jan 28;95(4). pii: JVI.01776-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01776-20.

Aim of the NeoSTOP multisite randomized phase II trial was to assess efficacy of anthracycline-free and anthracycline-containing neoadjuvant carboplatin regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged >/=18 years with stage I-III TNBC were randomized (1:1) to receive either paclitaxel (P) weekly x 12 plus carboplatin AUC6 every 21 days x 4 followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) every 14 days x 4 (CbP --> AC, arm A), or carboplatin AUC6 + docetaxel (D) every 21 days x 6 (CbD, arm B). Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL) were assessed. Primary endpoint was pCR in breast and axilla. Other endpoints included residual cancer burden (RCB), toxicity, cost, and event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomized; arm A (n = 48) or arm B (n = 52). pCR was 54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40%-69%] in arm A and 54% (95% CI, 40%-68%) in arm B. RCB 0+I rate was 67% in both arms. Median sTIL density was numerically higher in those with pCR compared with those with residual disease (20% vs. 5%; P = 0.25). At median follow-up of 38 months, EFS and OS were similar in the two arms. Grade 3/4 adverse events were more common in arm A compared with arm B, with the most notable differences in neutropenia (60% vs. 8%; P < 0.001) and febrile neutropenia (19% vs. 0%; P < 0.001). There was one treatment-related death (arm A) due to acute leukemia. Mean treatment cost was lower for arm B compared with arm A (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The two-drug CbD regimen yielded pCR, RCB 0+I, and survival rates similar to the four-drug regimen of CbP --> AC, but with a more favorable toxicity profile and lower treatment-associated cost.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Sharma, Priyanka', 'Kimler, Bruce F', ""O'Dea, Anne"", 'Nye, Lauren', 'Wang, Yen Y', 'Yoder, Rachel', 'Staley, Joshua M', 'Prochaska,

Despite these advances, tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiation and rapid progression to metastatic disease are still seen in many patients. Evidence has shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs), a sub-population of cells that share many common characteristics with somatic stem cells (SSCs), contribute to this therapeutic failure. The most critical properties of CSCs are their self-renewal ability and their capacity for differentiation into heterogeneous populations of cancer cells. Although CSCs only constitute a low percentage of the total tumor mass, these cells can regrow the tumor mass on their own. Initially identified in leukemia, CSCs have subsequently been found in cancers of the breast, the colon, the pancreas, and the brain. Common genetic and phenotypic features found in both SSCs and CSCs, including upregulated signaling pathways such as Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, and TGF-beta. These pathways play fundamental roles in the development as well as in the control of cell survival and cell fate and are relevant to therapeutic targeting of CSCs. The differences in the expression of membrane proteins and exosome-delivered microRNAs between SSCs and CSCs are also important to specifically target the stem cells of the cancer.

The genetic modifications in these mice cause various cellular responses, resulting in histologic features unique to each strain. The NSG-SGM3 mouse strain is similar to the commonly used NSG (NOD scid gamma) strain but expresses human transgenes encoding stem cell factor (also known as KIT ligand), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 3. This report describes 3 histopathologic features seen in these mice when they are unmanipulated or after transplantation with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), virally transduced hCD34+ HSCs, or a leukemia patient-derived xenograft. The first feature is mast cell hyperplasia: unmanipulated, naive mice develop periductular pancreatic aggregates of murine mast cells, whereas mice given the aforementioned human cells develop a proliferative infiltrative interstitial pancreatic mast cell hyperplasia but with human mast cells. The second feature is the predisposition of NSG-SGM3 mice given these human cells to develop eosinophil hyperplasia. The third feature, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS)-like disease, is the most pronounced in both its clinical and histopathologic presentations. As part of this disease, a small number of mice also have histiocytic infiltration of the brain and spinal cord with subsequent neurologic or vestibular signs. The presence of any of these features can confound accurate histopathologic interpretation; therefore, it is important to recognize them as strain characteristics and to differentiate them from what may be experimentally induced in the model being studied.",,"['Janke, Laura J', 'Imai, Denise M', 'Tillman, Heather', 'Doty, Rosalinda', 'Hoenerhoff, Mark J', 'Xu, Jiajie J', 'Freeman, Zachary T', 'Allen, Portia', 'Fowlkes, Natalie Wall', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Dickerson, Kirsten', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Vogel, Peter', 'Rehg, Jerold E']","['Janke LJ', 'Imai DM', 'Tillman H', 'Doty R', 'Hoenerhoff MJ', 'Xu JJ', 'Freeman ZT', 'Allen P', 'Fowlkes NW', 'Iacobucci I', 'Dickerson K', 'Mullighan CG', 'Vogel P', 'Rehg JE']","[""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", '8789University of California, Davis, CA, USA.', ""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", '1514The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA.', '12266University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '12266University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '12266University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '12266University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '4002The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""5417St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201119,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,PMC8414369,['NOTNLM'],"['*NSG', '*NSG-SGM3', '*eosinophil hyperplasia', '*hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis', '*macrophage activation syndrome', '*mast cell hyperplasia']",,2020/11/20 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2020/11/19 05:30'],"['2020/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/19 05:30 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2021 Jan;58(1):181-204. doi: 10.1177/0300985820970144.

The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-proliferative effects and the underlying mechanisms of 8-OHD in K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. We found that 8-OHD induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and cell cycle arrest at the S phase by upregulating p21(Cip1) and downregulating cyclin D2 (CCND2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression. 8-OHD also induced autophagy, caspase-7-dependent apoptosis, and the degradation of BCR-ABL oncoprotein. 8-OHD promoted Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1)-mediated megakaryocytic differentiation as an increased expression of marker genes, CD61 and CD42b, and the formation of multi-lobulated nuclei in enlarged K562 cells. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis revealed a total of 3174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after 8-OHD (100 muM) treatment for 48 h. Bioinformatics analysis of DEGs showed that hemopoiesis, cell cycle regulation, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT)-mediated apoptosis/anti-apoptosis networks were significantly regulated by 8-OHD. Western blot analysis confirmed that 8-OHD significantly induced the activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, both of which may be responsible, at least in part, for the stimulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and differentiation in K562 cells. This is the first report on the anti-CML effects of 8-OHD and the combination of experimental and in silico analyses could provide a better understanding for the development of 8-OHD on CML therapy.",,"['Wu, Pei-Shan', 'Yen, Jui-Hung', 'Wang, Chih-Yang', 'Chen, Pei-Yi', 'Hung, Jui-Hsiang', 'Wu, Ming-Jiuan']","['Wu PS', 'Yen JH', 'Wang CY', 'Chen PY', 'Hung JH', 'Wu MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 717, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 970, Taiwan.', 'Center of Medical Genetics, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien 970, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 717, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 717, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201116,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,PMC7696406,['NOTNLM'],"['8-hydroxydaidzein', 'BCR-ABL', 'K562', 'MAPK', 'NF-kappaB', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy']",,2020/11/20 06:00,2020/11/20 06:01,['2020/11/19 01:02'],"['2020/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/19 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Nov 16;8(11). pii: biomedicines8110506. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8110506.,,E506 [pii] 10.3390/biomedicines8110506 [doi],,,,"['biomedicines8110506 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8110506 [doi]']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3327-828X'],,"['MOST-106-2320-B-041-006-MY3; MOST-108-2320-B-320-002-MY3/Ministry of Science and', 'Technology, Taiwan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved for first-line therapy: imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib. Unexpectedly, the outcome of long-term randomized trials has shown that faster response as achieved by higher doses of imatinib, imatinib in combination, or second-generation (2G)-TKIs, does not translate into a survival advantage. Serious and frequent, and in part cumulative long-term toxicities, have led to a reevaluation of the role of 2G-TKIs in first-line therapy. Generic imatinib is the current most cost-effective first-line therapy in the chronic phase. A change of treatment is recommended when intolerance cannot be ameliorated or molecular milestones are not reached. Patient comorbidities and contraindications of all TKIs must be considered. Risk profile at diagnosis should be assessed with the EUTOS score for long-term survival (ELTS). Monitoring of response is by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cytogenetics is still required in the case of atypical translocations, atypical transcripts, and additional chromosomal aberrations. TKIs are contraindicated during pregnancy.

In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of paired circulating CLL (PB-CLL) and RS biopsies (tissue-RS) from 17 patients recruited into a clinical trial (CHOP-O). We found that tissue-RS was enriched for mutations in poor-risk CLL drivers and genes in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. In addition, we identified genomic aberrations not previously implicated in RS, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor (PTPRD) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). In the noncoding genome, we discovered activation-induced cytidine deaminase-related and unrelated kataegis in tissue-RS affecting regulatory regions of key immune-regulatory genes. These include BTG2, CXCR4, NFATC1, PAX5, NOTCH-1, SLC44A5, FCRL3, SELL, TNIP2, and TRIM13. Furthermore, differences between the global mutation signatures of pairs of PB-CLL and tissue-RS samples implicate DDR as the dominant mechanism driving transformation. Pathway-based clonal deconvolution analysis showed that genes in the MAPK and DDR pathways demonstrate high clonal-expansion probability. Direct comparison of nodal-CLL and tissue-RS pairs from an independent cohort confirmed differential expression of the same pathways by RNA expression profiling. Our integrated analysis of WGS and RNA expression data significantly extends previous targeted approaches, which were limited by the lack of germline samples, and it facilitates the identification of novel genomic correlates implicated in RS transformation, which could be targeted therapeutically. Our results inform the future selection of investigative agents for a UK clinical platform study.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied a series of adult patients receiving TKI-based therapy to evaluate the prognostic impact of the normal karyotype (NK) (n=22) in BCR-ABL1+ ALL by comparison with the isolated Ph+ karyotype (n=54). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics and complete remission rate between the two groups. Compared with the isolated Ph+ group, the NK/BCR-ABL1+ group had a higher relapse rate (55.0% versus 29.4%, p=0.044). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly shorter in the NK/BCR-ABL1+ group than in the isolated Ph+ group [median OS: 24.5 versus 48.6 (months), p=0.013; median DFS: 11.0 (months) versus undefined, p=0.008]. The five-year OS and DFS for patients with NK/BCR-ABL1+ were 19.2% and 14.5%, respectively; those for patients with isolated Ph+ were 49.5% and 55.7%, respectively. Thirty-four (44.7%) patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in this study. Among the patients who received allo-HSCT, the median OS and DFS in the NK/BCR-ABL+ group (n=9) were 35.5 and 27.5 months, respectively, while those in the isolated Ph+ group (n=25) were undefined. There was a trend of significant statistical difference in the OS between the two subgroups (p=0.066), but no significant difference in the DFS. Multivariate analysis revealed that NK was independently associated with worse OS and DFS in BCR-ABL1+ ALL patients [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.256 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.005-5.066), p=0.049; HR 2.711 (95% CI, 1.319-5.573), p=0.007]. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the sub-classification of an NK could be applied in the prognostic assessments of BCR-ABL1+ ALL.

Longitudinal trends in the frailty state are not known and could help identify vulnerable subpopulations at risk of subsequent adverse events. METHODS: This study included a cohort of 470 autologous and allogeneic BMT recipients who had survived >/=2 years after BMT and completed a baseline questionnaire (t1) at a median of 7.3 years after BMT and a follow-up questionnaire (t2) 13.2 years after t1. The main outcome was change in frailty state between t1 and t2. Frailty phenotype was defined as exhibiting >/=3 of the following characteristics: clinically underweight, exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slow walking speed, and muscle weakness. The following categories of change in frailty state were evaluated: worsened, improved, and stable. RESULTS: Of the 470 participants, 36.4% were aged >/=60 years at t1, and 50.6% were men. The prevalence of frailty increased from 4.8% at t1 to 9.6% at t2. Worsening was observed in 18.8% of patients, and improvement was reported in 9.7%. Pre-BMT exposure to vincristine (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.39) was associated with worsening. Female sex (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.93-2.4) was associated with a trend toward worsening. Pre-BMT exposure to vincristine (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.44-5.43), a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5), and grade 3 and 4 chronic health conditions at t1 (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.08-4.33) were associated with frailty at t2. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of BMT survivors who were followed longitudinally for a median of 20.6 years from BMT, the frailty status worsened for approximately20% over a 13-year timespan.

However, directly targeting oncogenic MYC remains unsuccessful, and indirectly inhibiting MYC emerges as a promising approach. Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a protein kinase that coordinates the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and protects cancer cells from excessive replicative stress. Using c-MYC-mediated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and N-MYC-driven neuroblastoma as model systems, we reveal that both c-MYC and N-MYC directly bind to the CHK1 locus and activate its transcription. CHIR-124, a selective CHK1 inhibitor, impairs cell viability and induces remarkable synergistic lethality with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in MYC-overexpressing cells. Mechanistically, rapamycin inactivates carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD), the essential enzyme for the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and deteriorates CHIR-124-induced replicative stress. We further demonstrate that dual treatments impede T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and neuroblastoma progression in vivo. These results suggest simultaneous targeting of CHK1 and mTOR as a novel and powerful co-treatment modality for MYC-mediated tumors.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

Structural and functional alterations might underlie the cognitive late-effects identified in survivors of non-CNS CC. The present study evaluated resting-state functional networks and their associations with cognition in a mixed sample of non-CNS CC survivors (i.e., leukemia, lymphoma, and other non-CNS solid tumors). METHODS: Forty-three patients (off-therapy for at least 1 year and aged 7-16 years) were compared with 43 healthy controls matched for age and sex. High-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired. Executive functions, attention, processing speed, and memory were assessed outside the scanner. RESULTS: Cognitive performance was within the normal range for both groups; however, patients after CNS-directed therapy showed lower executive functions than controls. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed that patients exhibited stronger functional connectivity between fronto- and temporo-parietal pathways and weaker connectivity between parietal-cerebellar and temporal-occipital pathways in the right hemisphere than controls. Functional hyperconnectivity was related to weaker memory performance in the patients' group. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that even in the absence of brain tumors, non-CNS CC and its treatment can lead to persistent cerebral alterations in resting-state network connectivity.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Because CD28 plays a pivotal role in T-cell activation, we focused on alterations of the CD28 gene in ATL. We found multiple genetic abnormalities related to CD28 among the 144 patients enrolled in the present study. These involved gene fusions with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 or the inducible T-cell co-stimulator in 14 patients (10%), CD28-activating mutations in 3 (2%), and CD28 copy number variations in 34 (24%). Patients with such CD28 gene alterations were significantly younger than those without. In patients not receiving allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, those with CD28 gene alterations tended to have a worse prognosis than those without. Finally, patients with chronic or smouldering ATL subtypes with CD28 gene alterations had a significantly worse prognosis than those without. These findings indicate that ATL, especially chronic or smouldering subtypes, have a more aggressive clinical course and are more refractory to conventional chemotherapies or mogamulizumab if they harbour CD28 gene alterations, likely because of continuous, prolonged, and enhanced CD28 activatory signalling. Novel treatment strategies to overcome the effects of these CD28 gene alterations are warranted.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Evidences from several studies suggest that in patients who have achieved a sustained, stable and deep molecular response, TKI treatment can be safely discontinued with a close subsequent monitoring. Thus, a stable deep molecular response (DMR) has become a feasible treatment goal in CML. Areas covered: In this review, the main findings extrapolated from sponsored and real-life evidences regarding TKI discontinuation were discussed, through a broad research on Medline, Embase and archives from EHA and ASH congresses (including words such as discontinuation, treatment-free remission, TFR, etc). Moreover, suggestions emerged from international guidelines about treatment-free remission (TFR) are presented.

Dysregulation of several components of apoptotic pathways has been identified as potential driver in AML. Areas covered: Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL-XL, and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1), has been associated with worse outcome in AML. Dysfunction of p53 pathway (often through mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2)) and high expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) constitute other disruptions of apoptotic machinery. Significant antileukemic activity of BCL2 inhibitors (particularly venetoclax) in preclinical models has translated into improved objective response and overall survival in combination with hypomethylating agents in AML. Addition of MCL1, BCL-XL, or MDM2 inhibitors could potentially overcome resistance to BCL2 inhibition. Authors conducted a thorough review of available literature on therapeutic options targeting apoptosis in AML, using PubMed, MEDLINE, meeting abstracts, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Expert opinion: While venetoclax remains the core component of targeting apoptosis, ongoing clinical trials should help find ideal combination regimens in different AML subgroups. Future research should focus on overcoming resistance to BCL2 inhibition, optimal management of adverse events, and development of biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from apoptosis-targeted therapies.",,"['Ball, Somedeb', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Ball S', 'Borthakur G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, H.

Identification or confirmation of these translocations is carried out by a number of genetic and molecular methods, some of which are routinely used in clinical practice, while others are primarily used for research purposes. In the clinic, these methods serve to clarify diagnoses and monitor the course of disease and therapy. On the other hand, the identification of new translocations and the confirmation of known translocations are of key importance in the study of disease mechanisms and further molecular classification. There are multiple methods for the detection of rearrangements that differ in their principle of operation, the type of problem being solved, and the cost-result ratio. This review is intended to help researchers and clinicians studying AL and related chromosomal translocations to navigate this variety of methods. All methods considered in the review are grouped by their principle of action and include karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for whole chromosomes or individual loci, PCR and reverse transcription-based methods, and high-throughput sequencing. Another characteristic of the described methods is the type of problem being solved. This can be the discovery of new rearrangements, the determination of unknown partner genes participating in the rearrangement, or the confirmation of the proposed rearrangement between the two genes. We consider the specifics of the application, the basic principle of each method, and its pros and cons. To illustrate the application, examples of studying the rearrangements of the KMT2A/MLL gene, one of the genes that are often rearranged in AL, are mentioned.",,"['Lomov, Nikolai', 'Zerkalenkova, Elena', 'Lebedeva, Svetlana', 'Viushkov, Vladimir', 'Rubtsov, Mikhail A']","['Lomov N', 'Zerkalenkova E', 'Lebedeva S', 'Viushkov V', 'Rubtsov MA']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, M.V.

However, there is a strong need to figure out which settings should be activated or inhibited in autophagy pathway to prevail drug resistance and also to improve current treatment options in leukemia. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of well-known inhibitors of autophagy (as 3-MA, BafA1, and HCQ) in leukemia KG-1 and HL-60 cells exposed to arsenic trioxide (ATO) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity of cells were examined by MTT assay. Autophagy was studied by evaluating the development of acidic vesicular organelles, and the autophagosomes formation was investigated by acridine orange staining and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, the gene and protein expressions levels of autophagy markers (ATGs, p62/SQSTM1, and LC-3B) were also performed by qPCR and western blotting, respectively. The rate of apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated using flow cytometry. We compared the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of ATO and/or ATRA in both cell lines and demonstrated that some autophagy markers upregulated in this context. Also, it was shown that autophagy blockers HCQ and/or BafA1 could potentiate the cytotoxic effects of ATO/ATRA, which were more pronounced in KG-1 cells compared to HL-60 cell line. This study showed the involvement of autophagy during the treatment of KG-1 and HL-60 cells by ATO/ATRA.

A common pattern of leukemic transformation involves the appearance of hematopoietic clones with CSF3 receptor (CSF3R) mutations in the neutropenic phase, followed by mutations in RUNX1 before AML becomes overt. To investigate how the combination of CSF3 therapy and CSF3R and RUNX1 mutations contributes to AML development, we make use of mouse models, SCN-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and SCN and SCN-AML patient samples. CSF3 provokes a hyper-proliferative state in CSF3R/RUNX1 mutant hematopoietic progenitors but does not cause overt AML. Intriguingly, an additional acquired driver mutation in Cxxc4 causes elevated CXXC4 and reduced TET2 protein levels in murine AML samples.

The disease has high mortality rate unless it is recognized and treated in time. Tissue pathology is crucially the diagnosis gold standard for treatment plan. This is a case report of an elderly female who presented with a huge right-sided cardiac tumour obstructing tricuspid flow. Case summary: An 81-year-old Asian female presented with clinical right-sided heart failure. Echocardiogram showed a large mass compressing and obliterating the right atrium. Trans-jugular tissue biopsy was performed. Initial pathology report was consistent with an angiosarcoma, based on an expression of Fli-1 (Friend leukaemia virus integration 1) from immunohistochemical staining. She died shortly after refusal to surgery. Autopsy was performed with diagnosis change to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after tissue pathology. Discussion: Primary cardiac lymphoma is extremely rare. Adequate tissue and proper immunohistochemical staining are mandatory for treatment plan. Besides an angiosarcoma, DLBCL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Fli-1 positive tissue cardiac mass.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Rodents are the main reservoirs, known to shed the bacteria in urine, thus contaminating water and soil and infecting other animals and people. Leptospirosis has been re-emerging in both developing and developed countries including Europe. It has been hypothesized that cats could be asymptomatic carriers of Leptospira. This study aims to evaluate cats' exposure to Leptospira in Lisbon, Portugal, by measuring IgG titres and correlating them with possible factors that may increase the risk of exposure in urban cats. Two hundred and forty-three samples were collected from the biobank. An ELISA test followed by a seroprevalence analysis using a finite mixture model was performed to detect and measure anti-Leptospira IgG antibodies titres. In parallel, a survey was conducted to identify possible risk factors for seropositivity. According to the ELISA test protocol, only twenty-three cats (9.5%; 95% CI =(6.1%;13.9%)) could be considered as seropositive to Leptospira antigens. However, when the same data were analysed by the best different mixture models, one hundred and forty-four cats (59.3%; 95%CI = (52.8%; 65.5%)) could be classified as intermediate and high antibody responders to Leptospira antigens. Seropositivity to Feline Immunodeficiency Virus infection (FIV) was found to be the only significant risk factor associated with anti-Leptospira IgG antibodies. In conclusion, the present studies raises the possibility of a higher exposure of cats to Leptospira than previously thought due to the identification of a subpopulation of cats with intermediate antibody levels.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Moreira da Silva, Joana', 'Prata, Sara', 'Domingues, Tiago Dias', 'Leal, Rodolfo Oliveira', 'Nunes, Telmo', 'Tavares, Luis', 'Almeida, Virgilio', 'Sepulveda, Nuno', 'Gil, Solange']","['Moreira da Silva J', 'Prata S', 'Domingues TD', 'Leal RO', 'Nunes T', 'Tavares L', 'Almeida V', 'Sepulveda N', 'Gil S']","['CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CEAUL - Centro de Estatistica e Aplicacoes, Faculdade de Ciencias, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Statistics and Operational Research (DEIO), Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CEAUL - Centro de Estatistica e Aplicacoes, Faculdade de Ciencias, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom.', 'CIISA - Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon, 1300-477 Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201001,Netherlands,Vet Anim Sci,Veterinary and animal science,101694897,PMC7648175,['NOTNLM'],"['ALP, serum alkaline phosphatase', 'ALT, alanine aminotransferase', 'AST, aspartate aminotransferase', 'CBC, complete blood count', 'CKD, Chronic Kidney Disease', 'ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay', 'FIV positive', 'FIV, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus infection', 'FeLV, Feline Leukemia Virus', 'Free-roaming cats', 'IDIU, Infectious Diseases Isolation Unit', 'IgG', 'IgG, Immunoglobulin G', 'Leptospirosis', 'MAT, microscopic agglutination tests', 'One Health', 'PAHO, Pan American Health organization', 'USG, Urine Specific Gravity', 'VTH, Veterinary Teaching Hospital', 'WHO, World Health organization']","['The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",2020/11/19 06:00,2020/11/19 06:01,['2020/11/18 06:01'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/18 06:01 [entrez]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Vet Anim Sci. 2020 Oct 1;10:100144. doi: 10.1016/j.vas.2020.100144. eCollection 2020 Dec.,,10.1016/j.vas.2020.100144 [doi],,,,"['10.1016/j.vas.2020.100144 [doi]', 'S2451-943X(20)30057-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their position at the junction of catabolic and anabolic metabolism couples this morphological plasticity, called mitochondrial dynamics, to larger cellular metabolic programs, which in turn implicate mitochondria in a number of disease states. In many cancers, fragmented mitochondria engage the cell with the biosynthetic capacity of aerobic glycolysis in service of proliferation and progression. Chemo-resistant cancers, however, favor remodeling dynamics that yield fused mitochondrial assemblies utilizing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through the electron transport chain (ETC). In this study, expression of Mitofusin-2 (MFN-2), a GTPase protein mediator of mitochondrial fusion, was found to closely correlate to Jurkat leukemia cell survival post doxorubicin (DxR) assault. Moreover, this was accompanied by dramatically increased expression of OXPHOS respiratory complexes and ATP Synthase, as well as a commensurate escalation of state III respiration and respiratory control ratio (RCR). Importantly, CRISPR knockout of MFN-2 resulted in a considerable decrease of doxorubicin (DxR) median lethal dose compared to a treated wildtype control, suggesting an important role of mitochondrial fusion in chemotherapy sensitivity and acute resistance.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Decker, Carl W', 'Garcia, Jerome', 'Gatchalian, Kristelle', 'Arceneaux, Deronisha', 'Choi, Clarice', 'Han, Derick', 'Hernandez, Jeniffer B']","['Decker CW', 'Garcia J', 'Gatchalian K', 'Arceneaux D', 'Choi C', 'Han D', 'Hernandez JB']","['Keck Graduate Institute, Henry E.

In particular, immune suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) may contribute to this defective antileukemic immune response, being recruited by bone marrow leukemic cells to evade immune surveillance. We evaluated Tregs (CD4+/CD45RA-/CD25(high)/CD127(low)), performing multiparametric flow cytometry on freshly collected bone marrow aspirate (BMA), in addition to the usual molecular and cytogenetic work-up in newly diagnosed AML patients to look for any correlation between Tregs and the overall response rate (ORR). We studied 39 AML younger patients (<65 years), all treated with standard induction chemotherapy. ORR (complete remission (CR)+CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)) was documented in 21 out of 39 patients (54%); two partial responder patients were also recorded. Apart from the expected impact of the molecular-cytogenetic group (p = 0.03) and the NPM mutation (p = 0.05), diagnostic BMA Tregs did not show any correlation with ORR. However, although BMA Tregs did not differ in the study population after treatment, their counts significantly decreased in responder patients (p = 0.039), while no difference was documented in nonresponder ones. This suggested that the removal of Treg cells is able to evoke and enhance anti-AML immune response. However, the role of BMA Tregs in mediating immune system-AML interactions in the diagnostic and posttreatment phase should be confirmed in a greater number of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Mario Delia et al.'],"['Delia, Mario', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Mestice, Anna', 'Frappampina, Roberta', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Delia M', 'Carluccio P', 'Mestice A', 'Frappampina R', 'Albano F', 'Specchia G', 'Musto P']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit-Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation-University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit-Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation-University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit-Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation-University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit-Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation-University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit-Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation-University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit-Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation-University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201104,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,PMC7657695,,,['There are no conflicts of interest to report.'],2020/11/19 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/11/18 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Immunol Res. 2020 Nov 4;2020:2134647. doi: 10.1155/2020/2134647. eCollection 2020.,20210816,10.1155/2020/2134647 [doi],"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['10.1155/2020/2134647 [doi]'],,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-8912', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7926-6052']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Nine patients with B-ALL showing low donor chimerism level and relapse after allo-HSCT were enrolled. Patients 1-3 received CD19 CAR-T cell therapy using cells derived from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (comprising a mixture of patient and original donor cells) as their donors could not provide PBMCs. Samples from the other six patients (Patients A-F) were investigated only in vitro. The changes in the degree of donor chimerism, function of the CD19 CAR-T cells and T cells in all nine patients were analyzed in vitro. The therapeutic effects and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated in Patients 1-3. Results: The CAR-T cells and T cells in all nine patients showed complete donor chimerism restoration following a 12-day culture period in vitro. These CD19 CAR-T cells demonstrated strong cytotoxicity towards Nalm 6 cells in vitro except in patients 3 and D. In the latter patients, the absolute numbers of all subsets, especially the CD8 + T-cell absolute numbers in peripheral blood were very low. Patients 3 and D showed relatively short durations from transplant to recurrence and received chemotherapy after relapse. In the patients receiving CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, the most commonly observed AE was grade 1 to 2 cytokine release syndrome. None of the cases showed acute graft-versus-host disease during treatment. Patients 1 and 2 achieved complete response with complete restoration of donor chimerism. Patient 3, who received the same CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, did not respond to this therapy. Conclusion: CD19 CAR-T cells derived from patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with a low level of donor chimerism were effective for salvage therapy and could restore to complete donor chimerism after 12 days' culture in vitro.

This report described a sensibility and validation of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of methotrexate concentration in children's plasma. Methods: One-step protein precipitation of samples was accomplished by adding 200 muL of acetonitrile to 100 muL of plasma sample. The separation of plasma samples was carried out on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 Rapid Resolution HD column with gradient elution using a mobile phase constituted of acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. The detection was executed by electrospray ionization (ESI) of triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (TQMS) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with the transitions m/z 455.2 --> 307.9 for methotrexate and m/z 458.2 --> 311.2 for IS, separately. Linear concentration range of the calibration curve was 44-11,000 nmol/L and 44 nmol/L was the lower limit of quantification. Results: The methotrexate elution time was at 1.577 min, and the overall running time was only 3.3 min. The intra- and interday precision for all the analysis results was within 11.24%, and mean recoveries rate of methotrexate exceeded 87.98%.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a new pre-emptive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) strategy on relapse in Ph+ALL patients with complete remission undergoing allo-HCT. Pre-emptive TKIs initiation was based on BCR/ABL molecular monitoring. TKIs choice was based on BCR/ABL mutations. Donor lymphocyte infusion was recommended in those with poor response to TKIs. Prophylactic TKIs from historical data were as control. The primary endpoint was relapse. One hundred and sixty-seven Ph+ALL patients were enrolled in this study, including 103 in the pre-emptive group and 64 in the prophylactic group. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 11% and 31% in the pre-emptive and prophylactic groups (P = 0.001), respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 87% and 66% (P = 0.001), and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 83% and 61% (P = 0.000), respectively, in the pre-emptive and prophylactic groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the pre-emptive strategy was the protective factor for relapse, OS, and LFS (P = 0.005, P = 0.005, and P = 0.003, respectively).

Here, we found that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) were highly differentiated, and leukemia progression was severely impaired in the absence of AMD1 in vivo. AMD1 was highly upregulated as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progressed from the chronic phase to the blast crisis phase, and was associated with the poor prognosis of CML patients. In addition, the pharmacological inhibition of AMD1 by AO476 treatment resulted in a robust reduction of the progression of leukemic cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, AMD1 depletion induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in the differentiation of LSCs via oxidative stress and aberrant activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which was partially rescued by the addition of polyamine. These results indicate that AMD1 is an essential element in the progression of myeloid leukemia and could be an attractive target for the treatment of the disease.",,"['Sari, Ita Novita', 'Yang, Ying-Gui', 'Wijaya, Yoseph Toni', 'Jun, Nayoung', 'Lee, Sanghyun', 'Kim, Kwang Seock', 'Bajaj, Jeevisha', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Choi, Soo-Young', 'Park, Sa-Hee', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Reya, Tannishtha', 'Han, Jaeseok', 'Kwon, Hyog Young']","['Sari IN', 'Yang YG', 'Wijaya YT', 'Jun N', 'Lee S', 'Kim KS', 'Bajaj J', 'Oehler VG', 'Kim SH', 'Choi SY', 'Park SH', 'Kim DW', 'Reya T', 'Han J', 'Kwon HY']","['Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Viral Oncology, The Clinical Innovation & Research Center (CIRC), Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Catholic Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Catholic Leukemia Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, Republic of Korea. hykwon@sch.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201117,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,,2020/11/19 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2020/11/18 05:55'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/18 05:55 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Jan;40(3):603-617. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01547-x.

We concurrently evaluated cognition, behavior, and quality of life in child and adolescent ALL survivors and determined associations between them. METHODS: The sample included 83 controls (mean age: 12.5 years) and 71 ALL survivors (mean age: 11.9 years, mean age at diagnosis: 3.8 years). Participants completed measures of general intellectual abilities, math achievement, and fine motor skills. Parents and teachers completed a survey assessing child participants' cognitive, behavioral, and emotional function. Parents additionally completed a survey about their child's quality of life. RESULTS: Survivors had lower scores on measures of working memory, processing speed, timed math, and fine motor skills (effect size 0.5-1, p < 0.001). Parents identified more problems with executive function and learning in survivors than controls (effect size > 0.7, p < 0.001), and indicated a lower quality of life in all categories evaluated (effect size > 0.7, p < 10(-4)). Reduced quality of life was associated with lower math achievement scores and with inattention and executive function problems. CONCLUSIONS: ALL survivors experience diffuse cognitive, behavioral, and motor impairments, which are associated with reduced quality of life. These findings underscore the need to address these challenges in ALL survivors. IMPACT: Compared with cancer-free peers, parents of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors treated with chemotherapy only reported reduced quality of life. Math difficulties and behavioral problems increased the risk for reduced quality of life. Reduced quality of life is associated with mild cognitive and behavioral difficulties, suggesting that even relatively mild impairments have broad implications for ALL survivors. Screening and early intervention targeting cognitive and behavioral function may enhance quality of life for ALL survivors.","['(c) 2020.

We observe a specific mutational pattern and an average of 25-fold increase of mutation rates in XP-C versus sporadic leukemia which we presume leads to its elevated incidence and early appearance. We describe a strong mutational asymmetry with respect to transcription and the direction of replication in XP-C tumors suggesting association of mutagenesis with bulky purine DNA lesions of probably endogenous origin.

We report EnvP(b)1 sequences in primate genomes consistent with an integration event between 40 and 71 million years ago. Using a highly specific polyclonal antiserum raised against the putative receptor binding domain (RBD) of human EnvP(b)1, we detected expression in human placenta, ovaries, and thymus. We found that EnvP(b)1 is proteolytically processed, and using cell-cell fusion assays in multiple primate cell lines, we demonstrated that extant EnvP(b)1 proteins from a variety of primate genomes are fusogenic. This work supports the idea that EnvP(b)1 is under purifying selection and its fusogenic activity has been maintained for over 40 million years. We determined the structure of the RBD of human EnvP(b)1, which defines structural similarities with extant leukemia viruses, despite little sequence conservation. This structure highlights a common scaffold from which novel receptor binding specificities likely evolved. The evolutionary plasticity of this domain may underlie the diversity of related Envs in circulating viruses.IMPORTANCE Organisms can access genetic and functional novelty by capturing viral elements within their genomes, where they can evolve to drive new cellular or organismal processes. We demonstrate that a retroviral envelope gene, EnvP(b)1, has been maintained and its fusion activity preserved for 40 to 71 million years. It is expressed as a protein in multiple healthy human tissues. We determined the structure of its inferred receptor binding domain and compared it with the same domain in modern viruses. We found a common conserved architecture that underlies the varied receptor binding activity of divergent Env genes.

Although normal cells often rely on extracellular serine and glycine supply, a significant subset of cancers becomes addicted to intracellular serine/glycine synthesis, offering an attractive drug target. Previously developed inhibitors of serine/glycine synthesis enzymes did not reach clinical trials due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles, implying that further efforts to identify clinically applicable drugs targeting this pathway are required. In this study, we aimed to develop therapies that can rapidly enter the clinical practice by focusing on drug repurposing, as their safety and cost-effectiveness have been optimized before. Using a yeast model system, we repurposed two compounds, sertraline and thimerosal, for their selective toxicity against serine/glycine synthesis-addicted breast cancer and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Isotope tracer metabolomics, computational docking, enzymatic assays, and drug-target interaction studies revealed that sertraline and thimerosal inhibit serine/glycine synthesis enzymes serine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, respectively. In addition, we demonstrated that sertraline's antiproliferative activity was further aggravated by mitochondrial inhibitors, such as the antimalarial artemether, by causing G1-S cell-cycle arrest.

However, the efficacy of oncogene-targeted therapies varies substantially. For instance, targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is effective in some non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but not in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), although these cancers show a similar degree of increase in EGFR activity. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 genetic knockout screen, we found that the Elongator (ELP) complex mediates insensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in TNBC cells by promoting the synthesis of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. Depleting ELP proteins promoted apoptotic cell death in an EGFR inhibition-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1 synergized with EGFR inhibition in a panel of genetically diverse TNBC cells. The findings indicate that TNBC ""addiction"" to EGFR signaling is masked by the ELP complex and that resistance to EGFR inhibitors in TNBC might be overcome by cotargeting Mcl-1.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

No comparable activity is observed with cytarabine, a cytidine analogue without DNA-hypomethylating properties. As evidence exists for compounding hypermethylation and gene silencing of hemizygous tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we thus hypothesized that this effect may preferentially be reversed by the HMAs decitabine and azacitidine. An unbiased RNA-sequencing approach was developed to interrogate decitabine-induced transcriptome changes in AML cell lines with or without a deletion of chromosomes 7q, 5q or 17p. HMA treatment preferentially upregulated several hemizygous TSG in this genomic region, significantly derepressing endogenous retrovirus (ERV)3-1, with promoter demethylation, enhanced chromatin accessibility, and increased H3K4me3 levels. Decitabine globally reactivated multiple transposable elements, with activation of the dsRNA sensor RIG-I and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7. Induction of ERV3-1 and RIG-I mRNA was also observed during decitabine treatment in vivo in serially sorted peripheral blood AML blasts. In patient-derived monosomal karyotype AML murine xenografts, decitabine treatment resulted in superior survival rates compared with cytarabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate preferential gene derepression and ERV reactivation in AML with chromosomal deletions, providing a mechanistic explanation that supports the clinical observation of superiority of HMA over cytarabine in this difficult-to-treat patient group. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the intriguing clinical activity of HMAs in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 deletions and other monosomal karyotypes.See related commentary by O'Hagan et al., p. 813.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Greve, Gabriele', 'Schuler, Julia', 'Gruning, Bjorn A', 'Berberich, Bettina', 'Stomper, Julia', 'Zimmer, Dennis', 'Gutenkunst, Lea', 'Bonisch, Ulrike', 'Meier, Ruth', 'Blagitko-Dorfs, Nadja', 'Grishina, Olga', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Weichenhan, Dieter', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Greve G', 'Schuler J', 'Gruning BA', 'Berberich B', 'Stomper J', 'Zimmer D', 'Gutenkunst L', 'Bonisch U', 'Meier R', 'Blagitko-Dorfs N', 'Grishina O', 'Pfeifer D', 'Weichenhan D', 'Plass C', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GmbH, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Deep Sequencing Facility, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Klinikum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'DKTK Partner Site Freiburg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",20201117,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,,,,2020/11/19 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/11/18 05:50'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/18 05:50 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Feb 15;81(4):834-846. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-1430.

Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the regulation of the biology of leukemia-initiating cells, where the antioxidant enzyme GPx-3 could be involved as a determinant of cellular self-renewal. Little is known however about the role of the microenvironment in the control of the oxidative metabolism of AML cells. In the present study, a coculture model of BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and AML cells (KG1a cell-line and primary BM blasts) was used to explore this metabolic pathway. MSC-contact, rather than culture with MSC-conditioned medium, decreases ROS levels and inhibits the Nrf-2 pathway through overexpression of GPx3 in AML cells. The decrease of ROS levels also inactivates p38MAPK and reduces the proliferation of AML cells. Conversely, contact with AML cells modifies MSCs in that they display an increased oxidative stress and Nrf-2 activation, together with a concomitant lowered expression of GPx-3. Altogether, these experiments suggest that a reciprocal control of oxidative metabolism is initiated by direct cell-cell contact between MSCs and AML cells. GPx-3 expression appears to play a crucial role in this cross-talk and could be involved in the regulation of leukemogenesis.",,"['Vignon, Christine', 'Debeissat, Christelle', 'Bourgeais, Jerome',

AML classification: according to French-American-British (FAB) classification, the 12 AML patients were classified as M0 1, M1 1, M2a 5, M2b 1, M3 2, M5 2; according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) prognosis stratified, low risk group 1 case, medium risk group 4 cases, high risk group 7 cases; classification of solid tumors: 3 cases of lung cancer, 1 case of breast cancer, 2 cases of gastric cancer, 3 cases of esophageal cancer, 1 case of rectal neuroendocrine tumor, 1 case of invasive hydatidiform mole and 1 case of sigmoid colon cancer. The median time interval for the diagnosis of two primary malignant tumors was 4 (from 2.6 to 5.6) months. Results of gene mutation detection: AML prognostic gene detection results: a total of 12 kinds of gene abnormalities including ASXL1, JAK2, TET2, U2AF1, ABCB1, FLT3-ITD, RUNX1, SETBPIT, TET2 (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP), p53, IKZF1 and IDH2 were detected, and solid tumor related genes were detected: a total of 4 kinds of gene abnormalities including Her-2, EGFR, K-RAS and MSI were detected. Survival: among the 12 patients, 1 case was lost during follow-up, 2 cases were still in treatment, 3 cases ended treatment and the condition was stable, 6 cases died. The median overall survival of 12 patients was 12.5 (from 3.8 to 48.0) months. Conclusions: It is not clear whether there is a certain correlation between the simultaneous occurrence of AML and solid tumors. Patients with AML and synchronous solid tumors are not unusual. Both tumors should be treated aggressively at the same time.",,"['Mi, R H', 'Dang, H B', 'Chen, L', 'Han, Y L', 'Wang, M F', 'Zhang, Y L', 'Chen, L', 'Li, D B', 'Wei, X D']","['Mi RH', 'Dang HB', 'Chen L', 'Han YL', 'Wang MF', 'Zhang YL', 'Chen L', 'Li DB', 'Wei XD']","['Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanyang Medical College, Nanyang 473000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua District Hospital of Pingdingshan City, Pingdingshan 467000, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Pingdingshan First People's Hospital, Pingdingshan 467000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Pingdingshan First People's Hospital, Pingdingshan 467000, China."", 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Multiple primary cancer', 'Simultaneous', 'Solid tumors', 'Survival']",,2020/11/18 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/11/17 23:39'],"['2020/11/17 23:39 [entrez]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Nov 17;100(42):3323-3327. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200721-02178.,20201119,10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200721-02178 [doi],,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200721-02178 [doi]'],,,,"['202102310365, 192102310053/The Science and Technology Research Project of Henan', 'Provincial Department of Science and Technology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the combined use of ATRA, ATO, and daunorubicin (DNR) in patients newly diagnosed with high-risk APL. The primary focus was to describe the drug dosage modifications made in the real-world scenario. METHODS: In this descriptive study, we included 16 out of 28 patients with high-risk APL from two tertiary care centers in South India (Vijayawada and Trichy) between January 2015 and December 2018. A unique approach of initiating ATRA at a dose of 25 mg/m(2) on day 1 and escalation to 45 mg/m(2) after cytoreduction with DNR and hydroxyurea was followed in all patients to avert differentiation syndrome, in the setting of hyperleukocytosis at presentation. RESULTS: All patients who survived the first 3 days of admission achieved complete remission after a median duration of 29 days. There were no deaths during induction or consolidation, and the regimen was well tolerated; two patients developed grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy requiring treatment modification. After a median follow-up duration of 1.9 years, there were no hematologic or molecular relapses. CONCLUSION: The study sheds light on the modifications made to recommended dosages of ATRA, ATO, and DNR to optimize outcomes in high-risk APL and reaffirms the importance of ATO use in the front-line setting to achieve durable responses with minimal toxicity.",,"['Danthala, Madhav', 'Golamari, Krishna Reddy', 'Seshachalam, Arun', 'Mikkilineni, Anupama', 'Chappidi, Sitalata', 'Mekala, Mahesh Babu', 'Elangovan, Vidhubala', 'Chinnakali, Palanivel']","['Danthala M', 'Golamari KR', 'Seshachalam A', 'Mikkilineni A', 'Chappidi S', 'Mekala MB', 'Elangovan V', 'Chinnakali P']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Center, Manipal Hospitals, Tadepalli, Guntur District, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Center, Manipal Hospitals, Tadepalli, Guntur District, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr GVN Cancer Institute, Trichy, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal Hospitals, Tadepalli, Guntur District, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal Hospitals, Tadepalli, Guntur District, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Center, Manipal Hospitals, Tadepalli, Guntur District, India.', 'Fenivi Research Solutions.', 'Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,PMC7713580,,,['Conflicts of Interest Statement:'],2020/11/18 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/11/17 17:11'],"['2020/11/17 17:11 [entrez]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Nov;6:1749-1756. doi: 10.1200/GO.20.00226.,20210728,10.1200/GO.20.00226 [doi],"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'India', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects']",['10.1200/GO.20.00226 [doi]'],,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1282-3402', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8934-3696', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5510-1720', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3327-6962', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1268-0114', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8320-1016']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL1 is a histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) transferase that regulates the transcriptional activation of target genes. The role of MLL1 has been underexplored during decidualization. In our research, we found the expression of MLL1 was closely related to endometrial receptivity, and it was responsible to hormone stimulation. Inhibiting the function of MLL1 by MM102 reduced the transformation of HESCs. Furthermore, down-regulation of MLL1 by siRNA transfection significantly decreased PGR and its target genes expression. MLL1 act as a co-activator of ERalpha, and both of them were recruited to PGR regulatory regions, thus promote PGR transcription.

Our group previously reported that NPM1 mutant elevated autophagy activity and autophagy activation contributed to leukemic cell survival. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cytoplasmic NPM1 mutant involving in the autophagy pathway has not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) as a core autophagy protein was highly expressed in NPM1-mA positive OCI-AML3 cells and primary NPM1-mutated AML blasts. Meanwhile, we found that NPM1-mA could interact with ULK1 protein and positively regulated ULK1 protein levels. Mechanically, NPM1-mA promoted TRAF6-dependent K63 ubiquitination and further maintained ULK1 stability and kinase activity via miR-146a. In addition, ULK1 high expression-mediated autophagy activation and facilitated to leukemic cell proliferation. Finally, we demonstrated that restoring ULK1 expression, ULK1 inhibitor SBI-0206965 treatment and using shULK1 partially rescued the effect of NPM1-mA on autophagy and cell survival. In conclusion, our findings suggest that NPM1 mutant interacts with ULK1, and thus, maintains its protein stability, which is required for NPM1 mutant-mediated autophagic cell survival.

Improvements in clinical outcomes with venetoclax + obinutuzumab were maintained during long-term follow-up, when all patients had been off treatment for >/= 2 years. No significant between-group difference was observed in overall survival (OS). Venetoclax had an acceptable tolerability profile.

However, the precise mechanisms of the oncogenic activity of AML1-ETO is yet to be fully determined. The present study demonstrates that AML1-ETO triggers the heterochromatic silencing of microRNA-564 (miR564) by binding at the AML1 binding site along the miR564 promoter region and recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Suppression of miR564 enhances the oncogenic activity of the AML1-ETO oncoprotein by directly inhibiting the expression of CCND1 and the DNMT3A genes. Ectopic expression of miR564 can induce retardation of G1/S transition, reperform differentiation, promote apoptosis, as well as inhibit the proliferation and colony formation of AML1-ETO+ leukemia cells in vitro. Enhanced miR564 levels can significantly inhibit the tumor proliferation of t(8;21)AML in vivo. We first identify an unexpected and important epigenetic circuitry of AML1-ETO/miR564/CCND1/DNMT3A that contributes to the leukemogenesis in vitro/vivo of AML1-ETO+ leukemia, indicating that miR564 enhancement could provide a potential therapeutic method for AML1-ETO+ leukemia.","['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

The viruses associated with the greatest number of cancer cases are human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which cause cervical cancer and several other epithelial malignancies, and hepatitis viruses HBV and HCV, which are responsible for the majority of hepatocellular cancer. Other oncoviruses include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I), and Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCPyV). These oncoviruses include various classes of DNA and RNA viruses and induce cancer by a variety of mechanisms. However, cancers develop in a minority of infected individuals and almost always after chronic infection of many year's duration. Identification of the oncoviruses has provided critical insights in human carcinogenesis and led to several interventions that may reduce the risk of developing the tumors they induce. These interventions include preventive vaccines against HBV and HPV, screening for persistent HPV and HCV infections, antivirals for the treatment of chronic HBV and HCV infection, and screening the blood supply for the presence of HBV and HCV.

Leukemia cells express high levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). However, to the best of our knowledge, their interaction and potential synergistic inhibitory effects on the growth and survival of leukemia cells have not been investigated. The present study revealed the role of the Sphk1/S1P/SIRT1 axis in K562, KCL22 and TF1 cells and hypothesized that the inhibition of Sphk1 and SIRT1 had synergistic effects on the growth and survival of leukemia cells. Cell viability was tested using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and cell colony forming assay. Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-APC/PI staining. The stages of the cell cycle were measured using PI staining. Protein levels were measured by western blotting. Treatment of leukemia cells with S1P resulted in the upregulation of SIRT1 expression, whereas inhibition of Sphk1 induced SIRT1 downregulation in leukemia cells. Both SKI-II and EX527 actively suppressed growth, blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis of leukemia cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Sphk1 and SIRT1 exhibited suppressive effects on the growth and survival of leukemia cells.

Here, we report synergistic anti-leukemic activity of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (Ven) and the asparaginase formulation Pegylated Crisantaspase (PegC) in CK-AML in vitro and in vivo. Ven-PegC combination inhibited growth of multiple AML cell lines and patient-derived primary CK-AML cells in vitro. In vivo, Ven-PegC showed potent reduction of leukemia burden and improved survival, compared with each agent alone, in a primary patient-derived CK-AML xenograft. Superiority of Ven-PegC, compared to single drugs, and, importantly, the clinically utilized Ven-azacitidine combination, was also demonstrated in vivo in CK-AML. We hypothesized that PegC-mediated plasma glutamine depletion inhibits 4EBP1 phosphorylation, decreases the expression of proteins such as MCL-1, whose translation is cap dependent, synergizing with the BCL-2 inhibitor Ven. Ven-PegC treatment decreased cellular MCL-1 protein levels in vitro by enhancing eIF4E-4EBP1 interaction on the cap-binding complex via glutamine depletion. In vivo, Ven-PegC treatment completely depleted plasma glutamine and asparagine and inhibited mRNA translation and cellular protein synthesis.

However, the optimal dose of ATG in children undergoing allo-PBSCT for leukemia has not yet been established. Therefore, the impact of ATG dose on overall survival (OS), relapse, GvHD, and infectious complications was investigated. Patients administered high dose (unrelated: 7.5 mg/kg, haploidentical: 10.0 mg/kg) and low dose (unrelated: 3.75 mg/kg, haploidentical: 5.0 mg/kg) ATG during two consecutive time periods were compared. There were 78 (39.8%) patients in the low dose group and 118 (60.2%) in the high dose group. OS was superior in the low dose group compared to the high dose group (P = 0.017), and relapse incidence was significantly lower in the low dose group (P = 0.022). Cumulative incidences of acute and chronic GvHD were similar between the groups (P = 0.095 and P = 0.672, respectively). Cytomegalovirus reactivation (70.3% vs. 51.3%, P = 0.007), Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (81.4% vs. 39.7%, P < 0.001), and invasive bacterial infections (12.7% vs. 0%, P = 0.001) post transplant were more frequent in the high dose group compared to the low dose group.

Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a first-line medication in the management of oncohematological conditions such as chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Side effects of imatinib therapy are common, and paradoxically imatinib has been associated with both hypo- and hyperpigmented lesions, the underlying mechanism for which is still unclear. Hyperpigmentation associated with imatinib therapy is a potentially underreported phenomenon. This article presents an in-depth, clinicopathological review of the literature surrounding imatinib-related hyperpigmentation, alongside a case series of imatinib-related oral pigmentation with notable practical learning points.

In search of data for evidence-based treatment decisions, a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The screening process adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines (PRISMA). RESULTS: Only 3 trials were suitable for the base-case network analysis (ILLUMINATE, ELEVATE-TN, and CLL14). Regarding progression-free survival (PFS), fixed-effect analyses comparing ibrutinib-obinutuzumab (IO) with venetoclax-obinutuzumab (VO) (relative risk [RR], 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-2.81), acalabrutinib (A) with IO (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.47-1.61), and A with VO (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-1.01) revealed that the upper limit of the 95% CI for RR did exceed the 1.0 value. This indicates a lack of significant difference in PFS for IO, VO, and A. In contrast, acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab (AO) improved PFS in comparison with IO (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22-0.87) and VO (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15-0.56). No differences in the frequency of adverse events was observed across different TAs. Also, the analysis of PFS in relationship with high-risk genetic features (ie, TP53 aberrations, IGHV unmutated, 11q deletion) showed similar results for different TAs. However, patients with unmutated IGHV status fared better with AO than with VO in terms of PFS. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and network meta-analysis indicated that upfront AO prolongs PFS in comparison with IO and VO, whereas no differences are observed between IO, VO, and single-agent A.

This study aimed to investigate whether succinic acid show anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect of on T-ALL cell lines. METHODS: Time and dose-dependent effects of succinic acid on T-ALL cell lines were determined by using WST-1, caspase-3/ bicinchoninic acid (BCA), and Annexin V-Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) assays. We included the MRC-5 cell line in our study as a healthy control group. RESULTS: Based on our findings, 25 and 50 mmol dosages of succinic acid has shown an apoptotic effect on T-ALL cell lines for 48 h treatment. Also, it has shown that after 48 h exposure of 25 and 50 mmol dosages of succinic acid has no significant cytotoxic effect in healthy MRC-5 cells. Apoptotic activity of succinic acid on CCRF-CEM cell line was caspase-3 dependent but not for MOLT-4. As a consequence, succinic acid was found to effect for T-ALL treatment in vitro and might also enlighten new study fields for different cancer experiments.",['Copyright (c) 2020 IMSS.

Following treatment with surgery and standard chemotherapy he went on to develop three different hematological malignancies of distinct lineages in sequential fashion over a short time period. Despite treatment with multiple intensive chemotherapy regimens and a matched unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplant, he died 41 months after initial diagnosis of his GCT and 10 months after the first diagnosis of hematological malignancy.

Recurrence might be driven by telomere dysfunction-mediated genomic instability. In a pilot study, we investigated ten patients with oligodendrogliomas at the time of diagnosis (first surgery) and after recurrence (second surgery) using three-dimensional nuclear telomere analysis performed with quantitative software TeloView((R)) (Telo Genomics Corp, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). 1p/19q deletion status of each patient was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization on touch preparation slides. We found that a very specific 3D telomeric profile was associated with two pathways of recurrence in oligodendrogliomas independent of their 1p/19q status: a first group of 8 patients displayed significantly different 3D telomere profiles between both surgeries (p < 0.0001). Their recurrence happened at a mean of 231.375 +/- 117.42 days and a median time to progression (TTP) of 239 days, a period defined as short-term recurrence; and a second group of three patients displayed identical 3D telomere profiles between both surgery samples (p > 0.05).

The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is tightly controlled by interactions amongst members of three distinct subgroups of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins. The pro-survival BCL2 proteins prevent apoptosis by keeping the pro-apoptotic effector proteins BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) and BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) in check, while the BH3-only proteins initiate apoptosis by either neutralizing the pro-survival BCL2 proteins or directly activating the pro-apoptotic effector proteins. This tripartite regulatory mechanism is commonly perturbed in B-cell malignancies facilitating cell death evasion. Over the past two decades, structure-based drug discovery has resulted in the development of a series of small molecules that mimic the function of BH3-only proteins called the BH3 mimetics. The most clinically advanced of these is venetoclax, which is a highly selective inhibitor of BCL2 that has transformed the treatment landscape for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Other BH3 mimetics, which selectively target myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma extra large (BCLxL), are currently under investigation for use in diverse malignancies. Here, we review the current role of BH3 mimetics in the treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies and address open questions in this rapidly evolving field.",,"['Lin, Victor S', 'Xu, Zhuo-Fan', 'Huang, David C S', 'Thijssen, Rachel']","['Lin VS', 'Xu ZF', 'Huang DCS', 'Thijssen R']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, 3052 Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, 3000 Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, 3052 Parkville, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, 30 Shuangqing Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100084, China.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, 3052 Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, 3000 Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, 3052 Parkville, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, 3000 Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201112,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC7696913,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'BCL2', 'BCLxL', 'BH3 mimetics', 'MCL1', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloma', 'venetoclax']",,2020/11/18 06:00,2020/11/18 06:01,['2020/11/17 01:06'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/17 01:06 [entrez]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Nov 12;12(11). pii: cancers12113353. doi: 10.3390/cancers12113353.,,E3353 [pii] 10.3390/cancers12113353 [doi],,,,"['cancers12113353 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12113353 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3432-0785', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3101-4873']",,"['5467-18/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', '7015-18/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', '-/China Scholarship Council', '1156024/Australian National Health and Medical Research Council', '1016701/Australian National Health and Medical Research Council']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increasing amount of data is helping to clarify the role of oxidative stress in toxicity and therapy response. Radioprotective agents are substances that moderate the oxidative effects of radiation on healthy normal tissues while preserving the sensitivity to radiation damage in tumor cells.

This observational, prospective, multicentre, non-comparative study of patients undergoing myelosuppressive and intensive chemotherapy for AML who are at high-risk of invasive fungal diseases (IFDs), describes AFP management and outcomes for 404 patients (65.6% newly diagnosed and 73.3% chemotherapy naive). Ongoing chemotherapy started 1.0 +/- 4.5 days before inclusion and represented induction therapy for 79% of participants. In 92.3% of patients, posaconazole was initially prescribed, and 8.2% of all patients underwent at least one treatment change after 17 +/- 24 days, mainly due to medical conditions influencing AFP absorption (65%). The mean AFP period was 24 +/- 32 days, 66.8% stopped their prophylaxis after the high-risk period and 31.2% switched to a non-prophylactic treatment (2/3 empirical, 1/3 pre-emptive/curative). Overall, 9/404 patients (2.2%) were diagnosed with probable or proven IFDs. During the follow-up, 94.3% showed no signs of infection. Altogether, 20 patients (5%) died, and three deaths (0.7%) were IFD-related. In conclusion, AFP was frequently prescribed and well tolerated by these AML patients, breakthrough infections incidence and IFD mortality were low and very few treatment changes were required.",,"['Gangneux, Jean-Pierre', 'Padoin, Christophe', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Saillio, Emeline', 'Kumichel, Alexandra', 'Peffault de La Tour, Regis', 'Ceballos, Patrice', 'Gastinne, Thomas', 'Pigneux, Arnaud']","['Gangneux JP', 'Padoin C', 'Michallet M', 'Saillio E', 'Kumichel A', 'Peffault de La Tour R', 'Ceballos P', 'Gastinne T', 'Pigneux A']","['Mycology Department, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, University Rennes, INSERM, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR S_1085, 35000 Rennes, France.', 'Pharmacy Department, CHU Martinique Site P.

Here, we present the identification of a first-in-class GSPT1-selective cereblon E3 ligase modulator, CC-90009. Biochemical, structural, and molecular characterization demonstrates that CC-90009 coopts the CRL4CRBN to selectively target GSPT1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Depletion of GSPT1 by CC-90009 rapidly induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) apoptosis, reducing leukemia engraftment and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in large-scale primary patient xenografting of 35 independent AML samples, including those with adverse risk features. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for effectors of CC-90009 response, we uncovered the ILF2 and ILF3 heterodimeric complex as a novel regulator of cereblon expression. Knockout of ILF2/ILF3 decreases the production of full-length cereblon protein via modulating CRBN messenger RNA alternative splicing, leading to diminished response to CC-90009. The screen also revealed that the mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response specifically regulate the response to CC-90009 in contrast to other cereblon modulators. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway by inactivation of TSC1 and TSC2 protected against the growth inhibitory effect of CC-90009 by reducing CC-90009-induced binding of GSPT1 to cereblon and subsequent GSPT1 degradation. On the other hand, GSPT1 degradation promoted the activation of the GCN1/GCN2/ATF4 pathway and subsequent apoptosis in AML cells. Collectively, CC-90009 activity is mediated by multiple layers of signaling networks and pathways within AML blasts and LSCs, whose elucidation gives insight into further assessment of CC-90009s clinical utility.

However, by the different mutations bypassing the effectiveness of Imatinib, a powerful impetus has emerged to bring more efficient agents into the field of treatment. The results of the present study declared that the companionship of our synthesized ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite with Imatinib was able to more efficiently decrease the survival of CML-derived K562 cells probably through inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent apoptosis. We also found a superior cytotoxicity in the presence of a well-known autophagy inhibitor, indicating that the apoptotic effect of this treatment was probably enhanced through the suppression of autophagy. Investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the growth-suppressive effect of ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4-plus-Imatinib clarified that the up-regulation of SIRT1 ceased the progression of the cell cycle, foremost by increasing the expression of p21 and p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Notably, we reported for the first time that either direct or indirect suppression of c-Myc resulted in an enhanced anti-leukemic effect; suggesting that the overexpression of c-Myc could play a contributory role in attenuating the efficacy of ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4-plus-Imatinib in K562. Given to the established efficacy of ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4 in CML cells, our preclinical results suggest that the application of this nanocomposite is an appealing strategy to boost the anti-leukemic effect of TKIs, which should be further studied in combination with other anti-cancer agents either in hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.",['(c) 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.'],"['Yousefi, Amir-Mohammad', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh', 'Fakhroueian, Zahra', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Yousefi AM', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi A', 'Fakhroueian Z', 'Momeny M', 'Bashash D']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences School of Paramedical Sciences, Tehran, Tehran, Iran (the Islamic Republic of).', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences School of Paramedical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (the Islamic Republic of).', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences School of Paramedical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (the Islamic Republic of).', 'School of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Institute of Petroleum Engineering, University of Tehran, 11155-4563, Iran, Tehran, Iran (the Islamic Republic of).', 'Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Turku, Finland, Turku, FINLAND.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences School of Paramedical Sciences, Tehran,Iran, Tehran, info@sbmu.ac.ir, Iran (the Islamic Republic of).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201116,England,Biomed Mater,"Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",101285195,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'Imatinib', 'Metal-based nanoparticles', 'Nanotechnology', 'ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4', 'c-Myc']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:00,['2020/11/16 20:17'],"['2020/11/16 20:17 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",aheadofprint,Biomed Mater. 2020 Nov 16. doi: 10.1088/1748-605X/abcae2.,,10.1088/1748-605X/abcae2 [doi],,IM,,['10.1088/1748-605X/abcae2 [doi]'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8029-4920'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, about half of ALL cases occur in children and adolescents and it is the most common acute leukemia until the early 20s, after which acute myeloid leukemia predominates. ALL is the most successful treatment paradigm in pediatric cancer medicine as illustrated by the significant survival rate improvement from approximately 10 % in the 1960s to >90 % today (Hunger et al., 2015) [2]. This remarkable success stems from the progressive improvement in the efficacy of risk-adapted multiagent chemotherapy regimens with effective central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis via well-designed randomized clinical trials conducted by international collaborative consortia, enhanced supportive care measures to decrease treatment-related mortality, in-depth understanding of the genetic basis of ALL, and refinement in treatment response assessment through serial minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring (Pui et al., 2015) [3]. These advances collectively contribute to a decline in mortality rate of 23.5% for children diagnosed with ALL in the US from 2000 to 2010 (Smith et al., 2014) [4]. Nevertheless, outcomes of older adolescents and young adults with ALL still lag behind those of their younger counterparts despite pediatric-inspired chemotherapy regimens (Stock et al., 2019) [5], relapsed/refractory childhood ALL is associated with poor outcomes (Rheingold et al., 2019) [6], and ALL still represents the leading causes of cancer-related deaths (Smith et al., 2010) [7]. The last two decades have witnessed important genomic discoveries in ALL, enabled by advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the landscape of germline and somatic alterations in ALL, some of which have important diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. Comprehensive genomic analysis of large cohorts of children and adults with ALL has revised the taxonomy of ALL in the molecular era by identifying novel clonal, subtype-defined chromosomal alterations associated with distinct gene expression signatures, thus reducing the proportion of patients previously labelled as ""Others"" from 25 % to approximately 5 % (Mullighan et al., 2019) [8]. Insights into the genomics of ALL further provide compelling biologic rationale to expand the scope of precision medicine therapies for childhood ALL.

The first therapeutic applications of BsAbs were focused on cancer therapy. However, these antibodies have grown to cover a wider disease spectrum, including imaging, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and therapy of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. BsAbs can be categorized into IgG-like formats and non-IgG-like formats. Different technologies have been used for the construction of BsAbs including ""CrossMAb"", ""Quadroma"", ""knobs-into-holes"" and molecular cloning. The mechanism of action for BsAbs includes the induction of CDC, ADCC, ADCP, apoptosis, and recruitment of cell surface receptors, as well as activation or inhibition of signaling pathways. The first clinical trials included mainly leukemia and lymphoma, but solid tumors are now being investigated. The BsAbs bind to a tumor-specific antigen using one epitope, while the second epitope binds to immune cell receptors such as CD3, CD16, CD64, and CD89, with the goal of stimulating the immune response against cancer cells. Currently, over 20 different commercial methods have been developed for the construction of BsAbs. Three BsAbs are currently clinically approved and marketed, and more than 85 clinical trials are in progress.

Not only mutation of the CEBPA gene, but also promoter methylation, which results in silencing of CEBPA, contributes to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sought for another differentially methylated region (DMR) that associates with the CEBPA silencing and disease phenotype. METHODS: Using databases, we identified a conserved DMR in the CEBPA 3'-untranslated region (UTR). RESULTS: Methylation-specific PCR analysis of 231 AML cases showed that hypermethylation of the 3'-UTR was associated with AML that had a myeloid/NK/T-cell phenotype and downregulated CEBPA. Most of these cases were of an immature phenotype with CD7/CD56 positivity. These cases were significantly associated with lower hemoglobin levels than the others. Furthermore, we discovered that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR can enhance transcription from the CEBPA native promoter. In vitro experiments identified IKZF1-binding sites in the 3'-UTR that are responsible for this increased transcription of CEBPA. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR is a novel regulatory element of CEBPA related to myeloid/NK/T-cell lineage leukemogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of CEBPA by IKZF1 may provide a clue for understanding the fate determination of myeloid vs. NK/T-lymphoid progenitors.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) is a commonly used MRD detection method. However, FCM MRD detection is not well standardized, and the interpretation is subjective. There are normal/reactive minor cell populations in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), which could be confused with MRD. METHODS: The FCM data of 231 BM and 44 PB pediatric samples performed in a recent 15-month period were retrospectively reviewed. These samples were from 56 B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, 11 T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, 28 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 44 cytopenia/leukocytosis patients, and five patients with mycosis fungoides. RESULTS: There were over 10 normal or reactive minor cell populations identified with certain phenotypes mimicking MRD of acute leukemia. These mimickers included CD19+ NK cells, CD22+ basophils, CD22+ dendritic cells (DCs), and plasma cells for B-ALL MRD; CD4/8 double-negative T cells, CD4/8 double-positive T cells, cytoplasmic CD3+ NK cells, CD2- T cells, CD7- T cells, CD5- gamma delta T cells, CD56+ NKT cells for T-ALL MRD; CD33+ NK cells, CD117+ NK cells, basophils, plasmacytoid DCs, non-classical monocytes, CD56+ and/or CD61+ monocytes for AML MRD. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the presence of a variety of normal/reactive minor cell populations that could mimic MRD of acute leukemia by FCM.

In the reverse process, as seen after hematopoietic transplantation, intravenously injected HSPCs home and engraft into BM niches. Here again, conditioning for transplantation by myeloablative chemo- or radiotherapy induces a state of sterile inflammation that promotes HSPC seeding to BM stem cell niches. Therefore, the trafficking of HSPCs and their progeny, including granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, is regulated by a response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. This responsiveness to inflammatory cues is also preserved after malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Results from our laboratory indicate that the responsiveness of hematopoietic cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli is orchestrated by Nlrp3 inflammasome. As reported, HO-1 effectively attenuates intracellular activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of several humoral mediators, including complement cascade (ComC) cleavage fragments that promote migration of hematopoietic cells. Based on this finding, inhibition of HO-1 activity may become a practical strategy to enhance the mobilization and homing of normal HSPCs, and, alternatively, its activation may prevent unwanted spread and in vivo expansion of leukemic cells.

There are few studies assessing appropriateness of platelet transfusion in this population. An audit was conducted to determine how appropriately platelets are transfused in acute leukaemia patients at a tertiary care health institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A six-year retrospective audit was conducted in acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients in an Academic Centre. Episodes were assessed as either appropriate or inappropriate based on guidelines from the British Society for Haematology (BSH). Pre-transfusion platelet count, transfusion indication, World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding score, and antibiotic use were all documented. RESULTS: Overall, 745 platelet transfusion episodes in 154 patients were audited. The proportion of episodes appropriately indicated according to BSH guidelines was 75.3%. Paediatrics and Internal Medicine had the lowest and highest proportion of appropriateness by department at 63.9% and 86.8%, respectively. The best alignment to guidelines was found on the wards (82.3%). Inpatient cases were significantly better indicated (p=0.002), whereas therapeutic and HSCT-related transfusions were not. The majority of inappropriate transfusions had a pre-transfusion count >20x10(9)/L without a valid justification (45.1%), whereas appropriate episodes were mainly accounted for by a pre-transfusion count <10x10(9)/L (69%). DISCUSSION: The 25% rate of inappropriate platelet transfusion in acute leukaemia patients underscores the learning needs of physicians, particularly those in training, regarding adequate use of platelets in haematologic malignancies to optimise its utilisation and patient outcome.",,"['Jaime-Perez, Jose C', 'Garcia-Salas, Gerardo', 'Turrubiates-Hernandez, Grecia A', 'Alvarado-Navarro, Dalila M', 'Marfil-Rivera, Luis J', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Garcia-Salas G', 'Turrubiates-Hernandez GA', 'Alvarado-Navarro DM', 'Marfil-Rivera LJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "", Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "", Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "", Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "", Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "", Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez "", Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201103,Italy,Blood Transfus,Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,101237479,PMC7850927,,,,2020/11/17 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/11/16 14:47'],"['2020/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/16 14:47 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Transfus. 2021 Jan;19(1):37-44. doi: 10.2450/2020.0045-20.

This disease is characterized by recurrent somatic mutations in SETBP1, ASXL1 and ETNK1 genes, as well as high genetic heterogeneity, thus posing a great therapeutic challenge. To provide a comprehensive genomic characterization of aCML we applied a high-throughput sequencing strategy to 43 aCML samples, including both whole-exome and RNA-sequencing data. Our dataset identifies ASXL1, SETBP1, and ETNK1 as the most frequently mutated genes with a total of 43.2%, 29.7 and 16.2%, respectively. We characterized the clonal architecture of 7 aCML patients by means of colony assays and targeted resequencing. The results indicate that ETNK1 variants occur early in the clonal evolution history of aCML, while SETBP1 mutations often represent a late event. The presence of actionable mutations conferred both ex vivo and in vivo sensitivity to specific inhibitors with evidence of strong in vitro synergism in case of multiple targeting. In one patient, a clinical response was obtained. Stratification based on RNA-sequencing identified two different populations in terms of overall survival, and differential gene expression analysis identified 38 significantly overexpressed genes in the worse outcome group. Three genes correctly classified patients for overall survival.","['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

The virus causes abnormal immune function and immunosuppression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in gene expression, having been associated with stress and immune response, tumor growth, and viral infection. The objective of this study was to determine the expression of circulating miRNAs produced by BLV in animals exposed to the virus. Sera from 14 animals were collected to establish IgG reactivity to BLV by ELISA, where seven animals were seropositive and seven were seronegative for BLV exposure. White blood cells (WBC) from each animal were also collected and miRNAs were identified by sequencing from sera and WBC. The seropositive group had higher counts of BLV miRNAs when compared to seronegative group in sera and WBC. Blv-miR-1-3p, blv-miR-B2-5p, blv-miR-B4-3p, and blv-miR-B5-5p were statistically significant (P < 0.00001) in serum with an average of 7 log2 fold difference between seropositive and seronegative groups. Blv-miR-B1-3p, blv-miR-B1-5p, blv-miR-B3, blv-miR-B4-3p, blv-miR-B4-5p, blv-miR-B5-5p were statistically significant (P < 1.08e(-9)) in WBC with an average of 7 log2 fold difference between the seropositive and the seronegative groups. Blv-miR-B2-3p and blv-miR-B2-5p were also statistically significant in WBC (P < 2.79e-17), with an average of 27 log2 fold difference between the seropositive and the seronegative groups. There were 18 genes identified as being potential targets for blv-miR-B1-5p, and 3 genes for blv-miR-B4-5p. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the target genes are mainly involved in the response to stress and in the immune system process. Several of the identified genes have been associated with leukemia development in humans and cattle. Differential expression of genes targeted by BLV miRNAs should be evaluated to determine their effect in BLV replication.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Casas, Ma and Lippolis.']","['Casas, Eduardo', 'Ma, Hao', 'Lippolis, John D']","['Casas E', 'Ma H', 'Lippolis JD']","['National Animal Disease Center, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Ames, IA, United States.', 'National Animal Disease Center, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Ames, IA, United States.', 'National Animal Disease Center, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Ames, IA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200922,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,PMC7536277,['NOTNLM'],"['BLV', 'cattle', 'microRNA', 'serum', 'white blood cells']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:55'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:55 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2020 Sep 22;7:536390. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2020.536390. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fvets.2020.536390 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fvets.2020.536390 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De novo mutations of BCL11B have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorder and immunodeficiency, such as immunodeficiency 49 (IMD49) and intellectual developmental disorder with speech delay, dysmorphic facies, and T-cell abnormalities (IDDSFTA). However, the pathogenesis of the neurodevelopmental disorder and T-cell deficiency is still mysterious. The strategy to distinguish these two diseases in detail is also unclear. Methods: A patient with unique clinical features was identified. Multiple examinations were applied for evaluation. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were also performed for the identification of the disease-causing mutation. Results: We reported a 17-month-old girl with intellectual disability, speech impairment, and delay in motor development. She presented with mild dysmorphic facial features and weak functional movement. MRI indicated the abnormal myelination of the white matter.

Primarily it functions in T cell receptor (TCR) activation through its tyrosine kinase activity. Aberrant expression of ZAP-70 has been evidenced in different B cell malignancies, with high expression of ZAP-70 in a subset of patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), associating with unfavorable disease outcomes. Previous studies to understand the mechanisms underlying this correlation have been focused on tumor intrinsic mechanisms, including the activation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Recent evidence also suggests that ZAP-70, intrinsically expressed in tumor cells, can modulate the cross-talk between malignant B cells and the immune environment, implying a more complex role of ZAP-70 in the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies. Meanwhile, the indispensible roles of ZAP-70 in T cell and NK cell activation also demonstrate that the autologous expression of ZAP-70 in the immune environment can be a central target in modulation of tumor immunity. Here we review the evidences of the link between ZAP-70 and tumor immunology in the microenvironment in B cell malignancies. Considering an emerging role of immunotherapies in treating these conditions, understanding the distinct molecular functions of ZAP-70 in a broader cellular context could ultimately benefit patient care.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Chen, Moore and Ringshausen.']","['Chen, Jingyu', 'Moore, Andrew', 'Ringshausen, Ingo']","['Chen J', 'Moore A', 'Ringshausen I']","['Department of Haematology, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Wellcome Trust/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Wellcome Trust/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Wellcome Trust/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201027,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7653097,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell lymphoma', 'CLL', 'ZAP-70', 'immunotherapy', 'tumor microenvironment']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:52'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:52 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 27;10:595832. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.595832. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.595832 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.595832 [doi]'],,,,"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer cells and TP53 germ-line mutations are responsible for the cancer-prone Li-Fraumeni syndrome. When mutated, the TP53 gene generally presents missense mutations, which can be distributed throughout the coding sequence, although they are found most frequently in the central DNA binding domain of the protein. TP53 mutations represent an important prognostic and predictive marker in cancer. The presence of a TP53 mutation does not necessarily imply a complete P53 inactivation; in fact, mutant P53 proteins are classified based on the effects on P53 protein function. Different models have been used to explore these never-ending facets of TP53 mutations, generating abundant experimental data on their functional impact. Here, we briefly review the studies analysing the consequences of TP53 mutations on P53 protein function and their possible implications for clinical outcome. The focus shall be on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), which also has generated considerable discussion on the role of TP53 mutations for therapy decisions.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Monti, Menichini, Speciale, Cutrona, Fais, Taiana, Neri,', 'Bomben, Gentile, Gattei, Ferrarini, Morabito and Fronza.']","['Monti, Paola', 'Menichini, Paola', 'Speciale, Andrea', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Fais, Franco', 'Taiana, Elisa', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Fronza, Gilberto']","['Monti P', 'Menichini P', 'Speciale A', 'Cutrona G', 'Fais F', 'Taiana E', 'Neri A', 'Bomben R', 'Gentile M', 'Gattei V', 'Ferrarini M', 'Morabito F', 'Fronza G']","['Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Haematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) di Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Haematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Unita di Ricerca Biotecnologica, Azienda Sanitaria Provinciale di Cosenza, Aprigliano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201028,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7655923,['NOTNLM'],"['P53 protein function', 'TP53 mutations', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'clinical impact', 'reactivation of P53']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:52'],"['2020/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:52 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 28;10:593383. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.593383. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.593383 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.593383 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this single center, single arm study, eleven patients with relapsed or refractory MDS/AML were enrolled and treated. Oral IRX195183 was administered at two dose levels: 50 mg daily or 75 mg daily for a total of two 28-day cycles. Patients with stable disease or better were allowed to continue on the drug for four additional 28-day cycles. Common adverse events included hypertriglyceridemia, fatigue, dyspnea, and edema. Three patients at the first dose level developed asymptomatic Grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia. The maximally tolerated dose was not reached. Four of the eleven patients had (36%) stable disease or better. One had a morphological complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery while on the study drug. Two patients had evidence of in vivo leukemic blast maturation, as reflected by increased CD38 expression. In a pharmacodynamics study, plasma samples from four patients treated at the lowest dose level demonstrated the capacity to differentiate leukemic cells from the NB4 cell line in vitro.

However, the biological and clinical significance of these BCR-ABL lineages has not been established; therefore, we aimed to clarify the impacts of these different BCR-ABL-expressing lineages. Patients: Multi-lineage BCR-ABL expression (multi-Ph) was defined as BCR-ABL expression outside of the B-lineage compartment, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in peripheral blood neutrophils and bone marrow clots, and flow cytometry-sorted polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We analyzed IKZF1 deletion patterns by PCR, examined gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing, and compared treatment outcomes across different BCR-ABL-expressing lineages. Results: Among the 21 multi-Ph patients in our 59-patient cohort (36%), BCR-ABL expression was detected at the multipotential progenitor level. However, no IKZF1 deletion patterns or gene expression profiles were identified that were specific for multi-Ph. However, multi-Ph patients were found to have better survival rates than patients with uni-lineage BCR-ABL expression [event-free survival (EFS): 74 vs. 33%, P = 0.01; overall survival (OS): 79 vs. 44% at 4 years, P = 0.01]. In multivariate analyses, multi-Ph was identified as a good prognostic factor for both EFS and OS. Conclusion: We confirmed that more than one-third of Ph+ALL patients could be classified as mutli-Ph. Although no specific molecular characteristics were identified for multi-Ph, this phenotype was associated with better treatment outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Nishiwaki, Kim, Ito, Maeda, Okuno, Koyama, Ozawa, Gunji,', 'Osaki, Kitamura, Ushijima, Ishikawa, Miyamura, Sugiura and Kiyoi.']","['Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Kim, Jeong Hui', 'Ito, Masafumi', 'Maeda, Matsuyoshi', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Koyama, Daisuke', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Gunji, Masaharu', 'Osaki, Masahide', 'Kitamura, Kunio', 'Ushijima, Yoko', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Sugiura, Isamu', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi']","['Nishiwaki S', 'Kim JH', 'Ito M', 'Maeda M', 'Okuno Y', 'Koyama D', 'Ozawa Y', 'Gunji M', 'Osaki M', 'Kitamura K', 'Ushijima Y', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Miyamura K', 'Sugiura I', 'Kiyoi H']","['Department of Advanced Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Medical Genomics Center, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Ichinomiya Municipal Hospital, Ichinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201023,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7646258,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL-expressing lineage', 'Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'multi-lineage', 'multipotent progenitor', 'uni-lineage']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:52'],"['2020/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:52 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 23;10:586567. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.586567. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.586567 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.586567 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One major change was from chemotherapy-based to chemotherapy-free treatment regimens, and the combination of ATRA plus ATO without chemotherapy has been recommended as the standard therapy for non-high-risk APL. The other major change was from the intravenous administration of medicine in the hospital to a largely home-based oral approach, which is a more cost-effective and convenient treatment model.

Longitudinal single-cell transcriptomics represents the state-of-the-art method to profile the disease heterogeneity at diagnosis and to inform about disease evolution. Here, we apply single-cell RNA-seq to a CLL case, sampled at diagnosis and relapse, that was treated with FCR (Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Rituximab) and underwent a dramatic decrease in CD19 expression during disease progression. Computational analyses revealed a major switch in clones' dominance during treatment. The clone that expanded at relapse showed 17p and 3p chromosomal deletions, and up-regulation of pathways related to motility, cytokine signaling and antigen presentation. Single-cell RNA-seq uniquely revealed that this clone was already present at low frequency at diagnosis, and it displays feature of plasma cell differentiation, consistent with a more aggressive phenotype. This study shows the benefit of single-cell profiling of CLL heterogeneity at diagnosis, to identify clones that might otherwise not be recognized and to determine the best treatment options.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Ostasov, Robertson, Piazza, Datta, Apperley, Houdova, Lysak,', 'Holubova, Tesarova, Caputo and Barozzi.']","['Ostasov, Pavel', 'Robertson, Henry', 'Piazza, Paolo', 'Datta, Avik', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Houdova, Lucie', 'Lysak, Daniel', 'Holubova, Monika', 'Tesarova, Katerina', 'Caputo, Valentina S', 'Barozzi, Iros']","['Ostasov P', 'Robertson H', 'Piazza P', 'Datta A', 'Apperley J', 'Houdova L', 'Lysak D', 'Holubova M', 'Tesarova K', 'Caputo VS', 'Barozzi I']","['Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Immunotherapy, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Imperial BRC Genomics Facility, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Imperial BRC Genomics Facility, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Imperial BRC Genomics Facility, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'NTIS, Faculty of Applied Science, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Immunotherapy, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Institute of Medical Genetics, Charles University in Prague and Faculty Hospital, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Hugh & Josseline Langmuir Centre for Myeloma Research, Centre for Haematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201030,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7664833,['NOTNLM'],"['advanced disease', 'case report', 'chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL)', 'disease progression', 'single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)', 'therapy resistance']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:52'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:52 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 30;10:584607. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.584607. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.584607 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.584607 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peg-asparaginase (peg-asp), a chemically recombined asparaginase with lower hyposensitivity and better patient tolerance, is now approved as the first line asparaginase formulation in ALL chemotherapy regimens. Due to the differences in pharmacokinetic characteristics and administration procedure between l-asp and peg-asp, this study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations of peg-asp-associated pancreatitis. Method: Patients with peg-asp-associated pancreatitis diagnosed within a 5-year period (July 2014 to July 2019) were identified and retrospectively studied. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and imaging results of patients with AAP were analyzed. AAP patients were further classified into mild/moderate and severe groups based on criteria used in previous studies. Clinical outcomes were compared between groups. Results: A total of 38 patients were enrolled in this study. The underlying disease included ALL (n=35) and lymphoma (n=3). The majority of patients developed AAP during the first phase, called remission induction (n=26, 68.4%), after a median of 2 peg-asp doses (range: 1-11). The DVLP regimen (n=23) is the most common peg-asp regimen used in AAP patients. Abdominal pain occurred after a median of 14.5 days (range: 1-50) from the last peg-asp administration, accompanied by abdominal distension (n=14), nausea (n=17), vomiting (n=21), and fever (n=19). Serum amylase elevation was reported in all AAP patients, of whom 65.8% (n=25) exhibited an elevation in the level of this enzyme three times the upper normal level, fulfilling the Atlanta criteria. The level of serum lipase (median days of elevation=23 days, range: 4-75) was significantly elevated compared with that of serum amylase (median days of elevation=9 days, range: 2-71) and persisted at a markedly high level after the level of serum amylase returned to normal. Common local complications included abdominal ascites (n=10) and peripancreatic fluid collection (n=8). Approximately 42.1% (n=16) of patients with severe AAP experienced systemic complications (septic shock or hypovolemic shock) or severe local complications (pseudocyst), among whom 5 failed to recover. Approximately 84.8% (n=28/33) of the remaining patients resumed chemotherapy; among them, peg-asp formulation in 30.3% (n=10/33) of these patients was adjusted, while asparaginase treatment in 39.4% (n=13/33) was permanently discontinued. Five patients experienced an AAP relapse in later stages of asparaginase treatment. Comparison between mild/moderate and severe AAP patients showed a statistically significant difference in the number of pediatric intensive care unit stays (p=0.047), survival rate (p=0.009), AAP prognosis (p=0.047), and impacts on chemotherapy (p=0.024), revealing a better clinical outcome in mild/moderate AAP patients. Conclusion: Early recognition and management of AAP is essential in reversing the severity of AAP. The existing AAP criteria had a low strength in determining the severity of pediatric AAP. A well-defined AAP definition could help distinguish patients with high anticipated risk for redeveloping AAP and ALL relapse, in order to prevent unnecessary withdrawal of asparaginase. Our study could serve as a basis for conducting future large cohort studies and for establishing an accurate definition of pediatric AAP.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, Yang, Qing, Li, Qian, Wang and Ning.']","['Zhang, Yun-Yu', 'Yang, Qiu-Shi', 'Qing, Xia', 'Li, Bi-Ru', 'Qian, Juan', 'Wang, Ying', 'Ning, Bo-Tao']","['Zhang YY', 'Yang QS', 'Qing X', 'Li BR', 'Qian J', 'Wang Y', 'Ning BT']","[""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20201028,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7656008,['NOTNLM'],"['asparaginase', 'childhood leukemia', 'pancreatitis', 'pegaspargase', 'retrospective study']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:52'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:52 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 28;10:538779. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.538779. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.538779 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.538779 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Front Oncol. 2021 Jun 03;11:709636.

Chemotherapy is the main clinical therapy, but the effective screening strategy for chemotherapy drugs is poorly investigated. Drug repositioning has been the center of attention in recent years attracting numerous studies. Here, we firstly found multiple common features between leukemia and TNBC by analyzing the global transcriptome profiles based on the transformed comparison data from NCI60. Therefore, we investigated the role of the classic leukemia drug thioguanine (6-TG) in TNBC cancer cells. Our results indicated that 6-TG inhibited cell proliferation and tumor cell progression by suppressing PI3K-AKT pathway via downregulating the DNA methylation level of PTEN. Moreover, apoptosis was induced via the activation of PI3K-AKT downstream TSC1 and the downregulation of methylation levels of DAXX, TNF, FADD and CASP8 etc. These findings indicated 6-TG exerts its anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo through regulating the DNA methylation levels of genes involved in PI3K-AKT and apoptosis pathway. Meanwhile, our study suggested that transcriptome-based drug screening has potential implications for breast cancer therapy and drug selection.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, An, Li, Man, Chu, Li, Zhang, Dai, Yu and Li.']","['Zhang, Daoyu', 'An, Xinglan', 'Li, Qi', 'Man, Xiaxia', 'Chu, Meiran', 'Li, Hao', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Dai, Xiangpeng', 'Yu, Hao', 'Li, Ziyi']","['Zhang D', 'An X', 'Li Q', 'Man X', 'Chu M', 'Li H', 'Zhang N', 'Dai X', 'Yu H', 'Li Z']","['Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'College of Animal Science, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Organ Regeneration and Transplantation of Ministry of Education, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201030,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7662440,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K-AKT', 'methylation', 'thioguanine', 'transcriptome', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:52'],"['2020/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:52 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 30;10:524922. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.524922. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.524922 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.524922 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, following the administration of arsenic trioxide (ATO), the relapse rate remains at 1-10%. It is not known whether the dosage of ATO is associated with the relapse rate in real-world settings. According to 2019 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the recommended cumulative ATO dosage in post-remission therapy is 7.95-12 mg/kg in APL. In the current study, 112 patients with newly diagnosed APL receiving a combination of all-trans retinoic acid, anthracycline-based chemotherapy and different dosages of ATO for variable courses, were divided into the high-dose (ATO dosage, >/=12 mg/kg) and low-dose groups (ATO dosage, <12 mg/kg). Relapse risk factors were analyzed by multiple factor analysis. The relationship between relapse rate and ATO dosage in post-remission was elucidated by determining the 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). Based on the ATO dosage in post-remission therapy, 72 (64.3%) patients were in the low-dose group and 40 (35.7%) were in the high-dose group. An increased ATO dosage was demonstrated to be an independent protective factor in terms of probability of relapse (P=0.004). With a median follow-up time of 53 months, the 4-year CIR was 16.7% in the low-dose group and 0% in the high-dose group, respectively (P=0.008). No patient relapsed when administered an ATO dosage >6 mg/kg. In conclusion, the relapse rate of APL was significantly associated with ATO dosage in post-remission therapy. An increased ATO dosage may serve as a protective factor of relapse. ATO dosage should therefore reach up to 12 mg/kg, with consideration to reduce the dosage in the future.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Gong, Sha', 'Wang, Huaiyu', 'Zhang, Huiyun', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhang, Xinxin', 'Zhao, Chenyang']","['Gong S', 'Wang H', 'Zhang H', 'Liu W', 'Zhang X', 'Zhao C']","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, P.R.

However, it remains debatable whether this result applies to patients in a real-world setting. Methods: We retrospectively assessed 208 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who underwent remission induction therapy. These 208 patients were stratified into the posaconazole prophylaxis group (n = 58) and no antifungal prophylaxis group (n = 150). Results: Multivariate analyses showed that induction failure significantly increased the risk of proven or probable IA during the first induction chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR), 10.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.73-63.45; p = 0.011] and the entire course of AML treatment (HR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.71-11.75; p = 0.002). However, posaconazole prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of IA during the first induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.14-15.04; p = 0.746) and during the entire course of AML treatment (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.29-4.09; p = 0.896). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in overall survival between these two groups of patients (514 versus 689 days; p = 0.454). Conclusion: Successful induction remains fundamental to reducing the risk of IA among AML patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy.","['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']","['Chen, Tsung-Chih', 'Wang, Ren Ching', 'Lin, Yu-Hui', 'Chang, Kuang-Hsi', 'Hung, Li-Ya', 'Teng, Chieh-Lin Jerry']","['Chen TC', 'Wang RC', 'Lin YH', 'Chang KH', 'Hung LY', 'Teng CJ']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.', ""Department of Medical Research, Tungs' Taichung Metroharbor Hospital, Taiwan."", 'Section of Medical Records, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, No. 1650, Sec. 4, Taiwan Blvd., Taichung, 40705, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201031,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC7607783,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'antifungal agent', 'aspergillosis', 'azole', 'chemotherapy', 'treatment failure']","['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:50'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:50 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Oct 31;11:2040620720965846. doi: 10.1177/2040620720965846. eCollection 2020.,,10.1177/2040620720965846 [doi],,,,"['10.1177/2040620720965846 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720965846 [pii]']",,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9744-0368'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism by which CEBPA double mutations promote AML remains poorly understood. Here we report that a family with three generations suffering from familial AML carries novel double mutations of CEBPA. Seven bases of GCGCGGG were inserted into the N-terminal c.113-114 of CEBPA as germline mutations and three bases of AAG were inserted into the C-terminal c.939-940 as a somatic mutation. To test the functional impact of this double mutation, we constructed plasmid encoding the double mutants of CEBPA and transfected it into the myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells. Lentiviral induced overexpression of CEBPA with these double mutations inhibited myeloid differentiation of these 32Dcl3 cells, and led to approximately 4-fold fewer frequency of CD11b expression.

Both recognize the same consensus DNA binding motif via their C-terminal zinc finger domains and regulate the expression of their target genes by recruiting chromatin modifiers such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and demethylases (LSD1) by using an N-terminal SNAG domain that comprises only 20 amino acids. The only region that is different between both proteins is the region that separates the zinc finger domains and the SNAG domain. Both proteins are co-expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and, to some extent, in multipotent progenitors (MPPs), but expression is specified as soon as early progenitors and show signs of lineage bias. While expression of GFI1 is maintained in lymphoid primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) that have the potential to differentiate into both myeloid and lymphoid cells, GFI1B expression is no longer detectable in these cells. By contrast, GFI1 expression is lost in megakaryocyte precursors (MKPs) and in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs), which maintain a high level of GFI1B expression. Consequently, GFI1 drives myeloid and lymphoid differentiation and GFI1B drives the development of megakaryocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. How such complementary cell type- and lineage-specific functions of GFI1 and GFI1B are maintained is still an unresolved question in particular since they share an almost identical structure and very similar biochemical modes of actions. The cell type-specific accessibility of GFI1/1B binding sites may explain the fact that very similar transcription factors can be responsible for very different transcriptional programming. An additional explanation comes from recent data showing that both proteins may have additional non-transcriptional functions. GFI1 interacts with a number of proteins involved in DNA repair and lack of GFI1 renders HSCs highly susceptible to DNA damage-induced death and restricts their proliferation. In contrast, GFI1B binds to proteins of the beta-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway and lack of GFI1B leads to an expansion of HSCs and MKPs, illustrating the different impact that GFI1 or GFI1B has on HSCs. In addition, GFI1 and GFI1B are required for endothelial cells to become the first blood cells during early murine development and are among those transcription factors needed to convert adult endothelial cells or fibroblasts into HSCs. This role of GFI1 and GFI1B bears high significance for the ongoing effort to generate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells de novo for the autologous treatment of blood disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Beauchemin and Moroy.'],"['Beauchemin, Hugues', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Beauchemin H', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201026,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7649360,['NOTNLM'],"['GFI1', 'GFI1B', 'hair cells', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'hemogenic epithelium', 'transdifferentiation']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:49'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:49 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Oct 26;11:591099. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.591099. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fgene.2020.591099 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fgene.2020.591099 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work investigated the associations between genetically predicted telomere length and cancers; however, the types of cancers investigated in those studies were relatively limited or the telomere length-associated genetic variants employed often came from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with small sample sizes. Methods: We constructed the genetic risk score (GRS) for leukocyte telomere length based on 17 associated genetic variants available from the largest telomere length GWAS up to 78,592 individuals. Then, a comprehensive analysis was undertaken to evaluate the association between the constructed GRS and the risk or mortality of a wide range of cancers [i.e., 37 cancers in the UK Biobank and 33 cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)]. We further applied the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effect of leukocyte telomere length on UK Biobank cancers via summary statistics. Results: In the UK Biobank dataset, we found that the GRS of leukocyte telomere length was associated with a decreased risk of nine types of cancer (i.e., significant association with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, kidney/renal cell cancer, bladder cancer, malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer and suggestive association with sarcoma/fibrosarcoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma/Hodgkin's disease). In addition, we found that the GRS was suggestively associated with an increased risk of leukemia. In the TCGA dataset, we observed suggestive evidence that the GRS was associated with a high death hazard of rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), sarcoma (SARC), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), while the GRS was associated with a low death hazard of kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). The results of MR further supported the association for leukocyte telomere length on the risk of malignant melanoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma/Hodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Conclusion: Our study reveals that telomere played diverse roles in different types of cancers. However, further validations in large-scale prospective studies and deeper investigations of the biologic mechanisms are warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Gao, Wei, Zhou, Huang, Zhao and Zeng.']","['Gao, Yixin', 'Wei, Yongyue', 'Zhou, Xiang', 'Huang, Shuiping', 'Zhao, Huashuo', 'Zeng, Ping']","['Gao Y', 'Wei Y', 'Zhou X', 'Huang S', 'Zhao H', 'Zeng P']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.', 'Center for Statistical Genetics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Center for Medical Statistics and Data Analysis, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Center for Medical Statistics and Data Analysis, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Center for Medical Statistics and Data Analysis, School of Public Health, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201023,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7644901,['NOTNLM'],"['Mendelian randomization', 'TCGA', 'UK Biobank', 'cancer', 'genetic risk score', 'leukocyte telomere length']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:48'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:48 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Oct 23;11:583106. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.583106. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fgene.2020.583106 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fgene.2020.583106 [doi]'],,,,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17228/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_QA137853/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many studies on the treatment and detection of AML have been conducted, the molecular mechanism of AML development and progression has not been fully elucidated. The present study was designed to pursuit the molecular mechanism of AML using a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, and build an applicable model to predict the survival probability of AML patients in clinical use. Methods: To simplify the complicated regulatory networks, we performed the gene co-expression and PPI network based on WGCNA and STRING database using modularization design. Two machine learning methods, A least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) algorithm and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), were used to filter the common hub genes by five-fold cross-validation. The candidate hub genes were used to build the predictive model of AML by the cox-proportional hazards analysis, and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and ohsu cohort, which were reliable in the experimental verification by qRT-PCR and western blotting in mRNA and protein levels. Results: Three hub genes, FLT3, CD177 and TTPAL were used to build a clinically applicable model to predict the survival probability of AML patients and divided them into high and low groups. To compare the survival ability of the model with the classical clinical features, we generated the nomogram. The model displayed the most risk points contrast to other clinical characteristics, which was compatible with the data of cox multivariate regression. Conclusion: This study reveal the novel molecular mechanism of AML, and construct a clinical model significantly related to AML patient prognosis. We showed the integrated roles of critical pathways, hub genes associated, which provide potential targets and new research ideas for the treatment and early detection of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Qu, Zhang, Qu, Guo, Wang, Wang, Huang and Zhou.']","['Qu, Ying', 'Zhang, Shuying', 'Qu, Yanzhang', 'Guo, Heng', 'Wang, Suling', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Huang, Tianjiao', 'Zhou, Hong']","['Qu Y', 'Zhang S', 'Qu Y', 'Guo H', 'Wang S', 'Wang X', 'Huang T', 'Zhou H']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical College, Qiqihar, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201028,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC7655922,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'machine learning', 'modularization', 'prognostic model']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:48'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:48 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Oct 28;11:566024. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.566024. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fgene.2020.566024 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fgene.2020.566024 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Spleen as a Neglected Hub of Inflammatory Cells.,586527,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) incidence is becoming higher. This fact is promoted by metabolic disorders such as obesity, and aging. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of most of these pathologies. It is a chronic inflammatory disease that begins with the progressive accumulation of lipids and fibrotic materials in the blood-vessel wall, which leads to massive leukocyte recruitment. Rupture of the fibrous cap of the atherogenic cusps is responsible for tissue ischemic events, among them myocardial infarction. Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), or blood cell production outside the bone marrow (BM), occurs when the normal production of these cells is impaired (chronic hematological and genetic disorders, leukemia, etc.) or is altered by metabolic disorders, such as hypercholesterolemia, or after myocardial infarction. Recent studies indicate that the main EMH tissues (spleen, liver, adipose and lymph nodes) complement the hematopoietic function of the BM, producing circulating inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the atheroma. Indeed, the spleen, which is a secondary lymphopoietic organ with high metabolic activity, contains a reservoir of myeloid progenitors and monocytes, constituting an important source of inflammatory cells to the atherosclerotic lesion. Furthermore, the spleen also plays an important role in lipid homeostasis and immune-cell selection. Interestingly, clinical evidence from splenectomized subjects shows that they are more susceptible to developing pathologies, such as dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis due to the loss of immune selection. Although CVDs represent the leading cause of death worldwide, the mechanisms involving the spleen-atherosclerosis-heart axis cross-talk remain poorly characterized.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Fernandez-Garcia, Gonzalez-Ramos, Martin-Sanz, Castrillo and', 'Bosca.']","['Fernandez-Garcia, Victoria', 'Gonzalez-Ramos, Silvia', 'Martin-Sanz, Paloma', 'Castrillo, Antonio', 'Bosca, Lisardo']","['Fernandez-Garcia V', 'Gonzalez-Ramos S', 'Martin-Sanz P', 'Castrillo A', 'Bosca L']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Biomedicina, (Unidad Asociada al CSIC), Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM) and Universidad de Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas y Sanitarias, Grupo de Investigacion Medio Ambiente y Salud, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Biomedicina, (Unidad Asociada al CSIC), Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (CSIC-UAM) and Universidad de Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201026,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7649205,['NOTNLM'],"['*atherogenesis', '*extramedullar manifestations', '*hematopoiesis', '*inflammation', '*spleen']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/11/16 08:47'],"['2020/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Oct 26;11:586527. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.586527. eCollection 2020.,20210614,10.3389/fimmu.2020.586527 [doi],,IM,"['Animals', 'Atherosclerosis/*physiopathology', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Spleen/*physiology']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.586527 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, it is now commonly admitted that the TME plays a crucial role in cancer development, maintenance, immune escape and resistance to therapy. This stands true for hematological malignancies as well. A considerable amount of newly developed therapies are directed against the cancer-supporting TME instead of targeting tumor cells themselves. However, the TME is often not clearly defined. In addition, the unique phenotype of each tumor and the variability among patients limit the success of such therapies. Recently, our group took advantage of the mass cytometry technology to unveil the specific TME in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in mice. We found the enrichment of LAG3 and PD1, two immune checkpoints. We tested an antibody-based immunotherapy, targeting these two molecules. This combination of antibodies was successful in the treatment of murine CLL. In this methods article, we provide a detailed protocol for the staining of CLL TME cells aiming at their characterization using mass cytometry. We include panel design and validation, sample preparation and acquisition, machine set-up, quality control, and analysis. Additionally, we discuss different advantages and pitfalls of this technique.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Gonder, Fernandez Botana, Wierz, Pagano, Gargiulo, Cosma,', 'Moussay, Paggetti and Largeot.']","['Gonder, Susanne', 'Fernandez Botana, Iria', 'Wierz, Marina', 'Pagano, Giulia', 'Gargiulo, Ernesto', 'Cosma, Antonio', 'Moussay, Etienne', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Largeot, Anne']","['Gonder S', 'Fernandez Botana I', 'Wierz M', 'Pagano G', 'Gargiulo E', 'Cosma A', 'Moussay E', 'Paggetti J', 'Largeot A']","['Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'National Cytometry Platform, Quantitative Biology Unit, Transversal Activities, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201020,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7606286,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*immunosuppression', '*lymphoma', '*mass cytometry', '*microenvironment']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/11/16 08:47'],"['2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Oct 20;11:578176. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.578176. eCollection 2020.,20210615,10.3389/fimmu.2020.578176 [doi],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD223 antigen)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.578176 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phylogenetic analyses of FIPs from different origins were performed using Neighbor-Joining method. It was found that FIP-mco belonged to a new branch of the FIP family and may evolved from a different ancestor compared with most other FIPs. The cDNA sequence of FIP-mco was cloned and expressed in the yeast Pichia Pastoris X33. The recombinant protein of FIP-mco (rFIP-mco) was purified by agarose Ni chromatography and determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. The protein rFIP-mco could significantly suppress the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 15 and 5 mug/ml, respectively, and inhibited the migration and invasion of human A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 15 and 30 mug/ml respectively in vitro. Further, rFIP-mco can significantly reduce the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in the THP1 cells (human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells). In order to explore the potential mechanism of the cytotoxicity effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cells, cell cycle and apoptosis assay in the two cancer cells were conducted. The results demonstrated that G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis may contribute to the proliferation inhibition by rFIP-mco in the two cancer cells. Molecular mechanism of rFIP-mco's reduction effect on the inflammatory cytokines was also studied by suppression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. It showed that suppression of NF-kappaB signaling is responsible for the reduction of inflammatory cytokines by rFIP-mco. The results indicated the prospect of FIP-mco from M. conica SH as an effective and feasible source for cancer therapeutic studies and medical applications.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wu, Sun, Deng, Song, Li, Zeng and Tang.']","['Wu, Guogan', 'Sun, Yu', 'Deng, Tingshan', 'Song, Lili', 'Li, Peng', 'Zeng, Haijuan', 'Tang, Xueming']","['Wu G', 'Sun Y', 'Deng T', 'Song L', 'Li P', 'Zeng H', 'Tang X']","['Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Biotechnology Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201026,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7649207,['NOTNLM'],"['*FIP-mco', '*Morchella conica SH', '*Pichia pastoris X33', '*anti-tumor', '*fungal immunomodulatory protein', '*immunomodulatory', '*rFIP-mco']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/11/16 08:47'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Oct 26;11:559770. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.559770. eCollection 2020.,20210519,10.3389/fimmu.2020.559770 [doi],"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'Morchella conica']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascomycota/classification/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.559770 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depletion of CD11b+ pan-MPhis in CD11b-diphtheria-toxin-receptor (DTR) mice is reported to cause implantation failure due to decreased progesterone production in the corpus luteum. However, of the M1 and M2, the type of MPhis that is important for implantation is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of M2 MPhi in implantation using CD206-DTR mice. To deplete M2-MPhi, female CD206-DTR C57/BL6 mice were injected with DT before implantation. These M2-MPhi depleted mice (M2(-)) were naturally mated with Balb/C mice. As the control group, female C57/BL6 wild type (WT) mice injected with DT were mated with male Balb/C mice. The number of implantation sites and plasma progesterone levels at implantation were examined. Implantation-related molecule expression was determined using quantitative-PCR and immunohistochemistry of uterine tissues. The mRNA expression in the endometrial tissues of 38 patients with implantation failure was examined during the implantation window. In WT mice, CD206+M2-like MPhis accumulated in the endometrium at the implantation period, on embryonic (E) 4.5. In M2(-), the implantation number was significantly lower than that in control (p < 0.001, 7.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.4), although the plasma progesterone levels were not changed. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and CD206 mRNA expression was significantly reduced (p < 0.01), whereas the levels of TNFalpha were increased on E4.5 (p < 0.05). In M2(-), the number of Ki-67+ epithelial cells was higher than that in control at the pre-implantation period. Accelerated epithelial cell proliferation was confirmed by significantly upregulated uterine fibroblast growth factor (FGF)18 mRNA (P < 0.05), and strong FGF18 protein expression in M2(-) endometrial epithelial cells. Further, M2(-) showed upregulated uterine Wnt/beta-catenin signals at the mRNA and protein levels. In the non-pregnant group, the proportion of M2-like MPhi to pan MPhi, CD206/CD68, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) and the TNFalpha mRNA expression was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the endometrial tissues compared to those in the pregnant group. CD206+ M2-like MPhis may be essential for embryo implantation through the regulation of endometrial proliferation via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Ono, Yoshino, Hiraoka, Sato, Fukui, Ushijima, Nawaz, Hirota,', 'Wada, Tobe, Nakashima, Osuga and Saito.']","['Ono, Yosuke', 'Yoshino, Osamu', 'Hiraoka, Takehiro', 'Sato, Erina', 'Fukui, Yamato', 'Ushijima, Akemi', 'Nawaz, Allah', 'Hirota, Yasushi', 'Wada, Shinichiro', 'Tobe, Kazuyuki', 'Nakashima, Akitoshi', 'Osuga, Yutaka', 'Saito, Shigeru']","['Ono Y', 'Yoshino O', 'Hiraoka T', 'Sato E', 'Fukui Y', 'Ushijima A', 'Nawaz A', 'Hirota Y', 'Wada S', 'Tobe K', 'Nakashima A', 'Osuga Y', 'Saito S']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kitasato University School Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kitasato University School Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kitasato University School Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201023,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7644510,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD206', '*M2 macrophage', '*Wnt/beta-catenin signal', '*diphtheria-toxin receptor mouse', '*fibroblast growth factor', '*implantation']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/11/16 08:47'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Oct 23;11:557184. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.557184. eCollection 2020.,20210514,10.3389/fimmu.2020.557184 [doi],"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannose Receptor)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Plasticity/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation/etiology/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mannose Receptor', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Uterus', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.557184 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, considerable effort has been expended to optimize NGS methods to explore the genome-wide distribution of proviral integration sites and the clonal architecture of clinically important retroviruses like human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). Once sequencing data are generated, the application of rigorous bioinformatics analysis is central to the biological interpretation of the data. To better exploit the potential information available through these methods, we developed an optimized bioinformatics pipeline to analyze NGS clonality datasets. We found that short-read aligners, specifically designed to manage NGS datasets, provide increased speed, significantly reducing processing time and decreasing the computational burden. This is achieved while also accounting for sequencing base quality. We demonstrate the utility of an additional trimming step in the workflow, which adjusts for the number of reads supporting each insertion site. In addition, we developed a recall procedure to reduce bias associated with proviral integration within low complexity regions of the genome, providing a more accurate estimation of clone abundance. Finally, we recommend the application of a ""clean-and-recover"" step to clonality datasets generated from large cohorts and longitudinal studies. In summary, we report an optimized bioinformatics workflow for NGS clonality analysis and describe a new set of steps to guide the computational process. We demonstrate that the application of this protocol to the analysis of HTLV-1 and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) clonality datasets improves the quality of data processing and provides a more accurate definition of the clonal landscape in infected individuals. The optimized workflow and analysis recommendations can be implemented in the majority of bioinformatics pipelines developed to analyze LAM-PCR-based NGS clonality datasets.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Rosewick, Hahaut, Durkin, Artesi, Karpe, Wayet, Griebel,', 'Arsic, Marcais, Hermine, Burny, Georges and Van den Broeke.']","['Rosewick, Nicolas', 'Hahaut, Vincent', 'Durkin, Keith', 'Artesi, Maria', 'Karpe, Snehal', 'Wayet, Jerome', 'Griebel, Philip', 'Arsic, Natasa', 'Marcais, Ambroise', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Georges, Michel', 'Van den Broeke, Anne']","['Rosewick N', 'Hahaut V', 'Durkin K', 'Artesi M', 'Karpe S', 'Wayet J', 'Griebel P', 'Arsic N', 'Marcais A', 'Hermine O', 'Burny A', 'Georges M', 'Van den Broeke A']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'VIDO-Intervac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.', 'VIDO-Intervac, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.', ""Service d'hematologie, Hopital Universitaire Necker, Universite Rene Descartes, Assistance publique hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, Hopital Universitaire Necker, Universite Rene Descartes, Assistance publique hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Institut Imagine, INSERM U1163, CNRS ERL8654, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, Universite de Liege (ULiege), Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201020,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC7606357,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'clonal architecture', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type-1', 'integration site', 'linear amplification-mediated-PCR', 'retrovirus']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:47'],"['2020/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Oct 20;11:587306. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.587306. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fmicb.2020.587306 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fmicb.2020.587306 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The Taiwan's National Health Insurance database was used to enroll 610,089 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients on at least 2 anti-diabetic prescriptions during 1999-2009. We followed-up these patients until 31 December 2011, in order to determine the incidence of leukemia. We used Cox regression model (incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment-weighting using propensity scores) to estimate hazard ratios in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Results: We enrolled 414,783 metformin initiators and 195,306 non-metformin initiators. Among them, 598 and 372 patients developed new-onset leukemia after a median follow-up period of 5.08 years and 6.79 years, respectively. The respective incidence rates were 26.52 and 28.40 per 100,000 person-years. The hazard ratio for metformin initiators versus non-metformin initiators was 0.943 (95% confidence interval 0.828-1.074) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.852 (95% confidence interval 0.705-1.031) in the per-protocol analysis. Sensitivity analyses after excluding patients using the exclusion criteria (a follow-up duration < 24 and < 36 months, respectively, patients with incretin-based therapies during follow-up, and patients enrolled during 2 different periods of 1999-2003 and 2004-2009) consistently showed a neutral effect. However, metformin initiators had a significantly higher risk of leukemia in the per-protocol analyses when censoring patients at a time without regular follow-up.

Intracranial involvement, causing ICH as an initial presentation is extremely rare in CML. Herein, we reported the first case of a newly diagnosed CML patient, who presented with headaches accompanied by nausea and vomiting as the initial presentations, caused by ICH. He underwent an emergency craniotomy twice and the postoperative pathologic examination confirmed intracranial CML involvement. Interestingly, his bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) smear and pathological study of the involved brain tissue showed proliferation of granulocytes, which were comprised mainly of metamyelocytes and myelocytes, without any blast within the brain tissue, suggesting the stage of CML was in the chronic phase (CP). He then received dasatinib treatment and achieved complete hematologic remission in the first 3-month follow-up but failed to reach a molecular response in the 6-month follow-up. By reporting this case and reviewing relevant references, we suggested intracranial CML involvement should be considered as a potential pathogenesis of ICH when the patient presents with hyperleukocytosis. A craniotomy is mainly for intracranial decompression and benefits the diagnosis of intracranial CML involvement. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in such patients to some extent, but more appropriate treatment strategies should be investigated in further detail.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Cao, Li, Sun, Jin and Wang.']","['Wang, Huafeng', 'Cao, Fei', 'Li, Jianhu', 'Sun, Ke', 'Jin, Jie', 'Wang, Ming']","['Wang H', 'Cao F', 'Li J', 'Sun K', 'Jin J', 'Wang M']","['Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Morphology Laboratory, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Morphology Laboratory, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201022,Switzerland,Front Neurol,Frontiers in neurology,101546899,PMC7642366,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'intracerebral hemorrhage', 'intracranial involvement']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:46'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:46 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Neurol. 2020 Oct 22;11:571576. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2020.571576. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fneur.2020.571576 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fneur.2020.571576 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects and specific underlying molecular mechanism of histone deacetylase inhibitors on lncRNA expression in AML cells are unclear. Here, we reported the effects of a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor Chidamide on proliferation and lncRNA expression in AML cells. Chidamide inhibited cell proliferation, blocked G1/S phase transition, and induced cell apoptosis through the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in AML cells. Chidamide also inhibited the formation of subcutaneous tumors. Transcriptome sequencing results showed that 1,195 lncRNAs were co-upregulated and 780 lncRNAs were co-downregulated after Chidamide treatment of SKM-1 cells and THP-1 cells. Combined with transcriptome sequencing data and the gene expression profiling interactive analysis dataset, we found that VPS9D1-AS1 expression was negatively correlated with the survival of AML patients. VPS9D1-AS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle, as well as inhibited the formation of subcutaneous tumors in vivo. VPS9D1-AS1 overexpression had the reverse effect. Furthermore, VPS9D1-AS1 knockdown inhibited the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and thus enhanced the inhibitory effect of Chidamide on AML cell proliferation. These findings suggested that targeted regulation of VPS9D1-AS1 might overcome the limitations of Chidamide in the treatment of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Lin, Que, Lu, Li, Xiao, Zhu and Li.']","['Lin, Liman', 'Que, Yimei', 'Lu, Pingfan', 'Li, Huimin', 'Xiao, Min', 'Zhu, Xiaojian', 'Li, Dengju']","['Lin L', 'Que Y', 'Lu P', 'Li H', 'Xiao M', 'Zhu X', 'Li D']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201019,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC7604502,['NOTNLM'],"['MEK/ERK signaling pathway', 'VPS9D1-AS1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chidamide', 'long non-coding RNA', 'proliferation']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:44'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:44 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Oct 19;11:569651. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.569651. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fphar.2020.569651 [doi],,,,"['10.3389/fphar.2020.569651 [doi]', '569651 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDC infiltration has been found in certain malignancies such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Our previous work reported that PDC infiltration could occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the clinical significance of PDC in AML has not been thoroughly investigated. Patients and Methods: Here, we evaluated the clinical significance of PDC to AML transition in a leukemia microenvironment. The frequency of PDCs in 80 acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) and 83 acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) patients was determined by flow cytometry. Results: We found 62 cases with PDC infiltration. These patients showed higher numbers of bone marrow blasts, higher mean Hb concentration, and required more cycles of chemotherapy before achieving complete remission (CR), but had lower white blood cell and platelet counts compared to patients without PDC infiltration. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that patients with PDC infiltration had lower sensitivity to standard chemotherapy regimens. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with PDC infiltration had a shorter overall survival (OS) time and progression-free survival time. Discussion: These results suggested that PDC infiltration can be used for risk stratification of AML-M4/M5, and PDCs may transdifferentiate into leukemia in an AML microenvironment.",['(c) 2020 Zhu et al.'],"['Zhu, Lidan', 'Wang, Ping', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Li, Qiong', 'Xiong, Jingkang', 'Li, Jiali', 'Deng, Xiaojuan', 'Liu, Yao', 'Yang, Chao', 'Kong, Peiyan', 'Peng, Xiangui', 'Zhong, Jiang F', 'Rao, Jun', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Zhu L', 'Wang P', 'Zhang W', 'Li Q', 'Xiong J', 'Li J', 'Deng X', 'Liu Y', 'Yang C', 'Kong P', 'Peng X', 'Zhong JF', 'Rao J', 'Zhang X']","[""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Otolaryngology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, USA.', ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical Center of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201106,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC7654521,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia; AML', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'prognosis', 'tumor-forming plasmacytoid dendritic cells; TF-PDCs']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2020/11/17 06:00,2020/11/17 06:01,['2020/11/16 08:43'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/16 08:43 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Nov 6;12:11411-11419. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S260825. eCollection 2020.,,10.2147/CMAR.S260825 [doi],,,,"['10.2147/CMAR.S260825 [doi]', '260825 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of miR-100 were (64.7%, 62.5%, and 0.642; respectively, P = 0.035) at a cut-off 2.6 and that of miR-210 were (60%, 58.3% and 0.650; respectively, P = 0.025) at a cut-off 3.5. miR-100 overexpression associated with shorter DFS and OS (P = 0.033 and 0.046; respectively). Patients with miR-100 lowexpression showed a significant incidence of late death ( P = 0.024). There was no significant association between miR-210 expression and DFS, OS, incidence of early or late death. CONCLUSION: : miR-100 and miR-210 could be used as potential diagnostic markers for pediatric ALL. miR-100 is a useful prognostic and predictive biomarker for childhood ALL.",,"['Hassan, Naglaa M', 'Refaat, Lobna A', 'Ismail, Ghada N', 'Abdellateif, Mona', 'Fadel, Sayed A', 'AbdelAziz, Rania S']","['Hassan NM', 'Refaat LA', 'Ismail GN', 'Abdellateif M', 'Fadel SA', 'AbdelAziz RS']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Leukemia', 'MicroRNAs', 'miR-100', 'miR-210']",,2020/11/17 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/11/16 08:42'],"['2020/11/16 08:42 [entrez]', '2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):405-413. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1843753.,20210204,10.1080/16078454.2020.1843753 [doi],"['0 (MIRN100 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN210 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1843753 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clinical studies were identified from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Overall complete remission (CR) and overall response rate (ORR) were used to evaluate the efficacy of VEN in combination with HMAs for AML/MDS, the incidence of the 4 most common grade 3-4 adverse events was used to evaluate safety. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies that included a total of 1059 patients. 7 cohort studies and 5 non-randomized controlled trials(NRCTs) were analyzed by random-effects model, and subgroup analyses showed the pooled overall CR rate of 62% (95% CI 57-67%, I(2) = 3%) for the new-diagnosed(ND) AML group, 39% (95% CI 30-48%, I(2) = 28%) for relapsed/refractory(R/R)-AML, and 61% (95% CI 50-71%, I(2) = 25%) for MDS, respectively. There was only one randomized controlled trial(RCT) that showed a CR rate of 66.4% in the patients who received azacitidine(AZA) plus VEN. A total of 8 studies reported adverse events, with cytopenia and infection being the most common grade 3-4 adverse events.

Several classes of Notch inhibitors have been developed, including monoclonal antibodies against NOTCH receptors or ligands, decoys, blocking peptides, and gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). GSIs block a critical proteolytic step in NOTCH activation and are the most widely studied. Current treatments with GSIs have not successfully passed clinical trials because of side effects that limit the maximum tolerable dose. Multiple gamma-secretase-cleavage substrates may be involved in carcinogenesis, indicating that there may be other targets for GSIs. Resistance mechanisms may include PTEN inactivation, mutations involving FBXW7, or constitutive MYC expression conferring independence from NOTCH1 inactivation. Recent studies have suggested that selective targeting gamma-secretase may offer an improved efficacy and toxicity profile over the effects caused by broad-spectrum GSIs. Understanding the mechanism of GSI-induced cell death and the ability to accurately identify patients based on the activity of the pathway will improve the response to GSI and support further investigation of such compounds for the rational design of anti-NOTCH1 therapies for the treatment of T-ALL. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: gamma-secretase has been proposed as a therapeutic target in numerous human conditions, including cancer. A better understanding of the structure and function of the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) would help to develop safe and effective gamma-secretase-based therapies. The ability to accurately identify patients based on the activity of the pathway could improve the response to GSI therapy for the treatment of cancer. Toward these ends, this study focused on gamma-secretase inhibitors as a potential therapeutic target for the design of anti-NOTCH1 therapies for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The underlying impaired stem-cell function leads to peripheral cytopenia, including a propensity to progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Allo-HSCT is considered the only potentially curable therapy. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have shown to improve early tolerability of the procedure, but late effects like graft-versus-host disease and relapse remain major challenges in the care of these patients. Therefore, special attention should be paid to posttransplantation care in terms of graft-versus-host disease management, measurable residual disease monitoring, and prevention of relapse. In fact, recent advances in the field have shown that minimal residual disease measurement and preemptive therapies may be a promising approach to prevent or at least delay relapse.

Standard treatment with high-dose chemotherapy plus rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) has extended overall survival although, the disease remains incurable. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are a family of enzymes that regulate multiple proteins and cellular pathways through post-translational modification. Broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors have shown some therapeutic promise, inducing cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis in leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, the therapeutic effects of these broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors can detrimentally dampen Natural Killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, reduce NK viability, and downregulate activation receptors important for NK mediated anti-tumor responses. Impairment of NK function in MCL patients during therapy potentially limits therapeutic activity of rituximab. Thus, there is an unmet need to decipher specific roles of individual HDACs in order to preserve and/or enhance NK function, while, directly impairing MCL viability. We investigated the impact of HDAC8 in MCL cell lines. Inhibition or genetic loss of HDAC8 caused MCL cells to undergo apoptosis. In contrast, exposure of primary human NK cells to an HDAC8 inhibitor does not alter viability, receptor expression, or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, an increase in effector cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) producing NK cells was observed in response to HDAC8 inhibition. Taken together these data suggest that selective HDAC8 inhibitors may simultaneously preserve NK functional activity, while impairing MCL tumor growth, establishing a rationale for future clinical evaluation.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, there have been a high frequency of violations in the optimum use of formalin levels. The consumption of fishes treated with excessive formalin levels leads to nasopharynx, leukaemia and sinonasal cancer and there is a huge demand for the development of formalin sensor. Conventional formalin sensors such as chromogenic and mass balance sensors fall short in real-time analysis due to the lack of specificity and sensitivity in the interference medium. In this context, it has been emphasized to develop a non-enzymatic electrochemical biosensor with microwave synthesized CdS nanoparticles as a nanointerface owing to its surface limited kinetics. NaCl of 1 mM was considered as an electrolyte solution in the present study. Dynamic sensing characteristics with varying formalin levels of 5-50 mgL(-1) was studied in three different concentration ranges as 5-15 mgL(-1) (concentration of formalin < NaCl; conversion of formalin to formic acid), 20-30 mgL(-1) (concentration of formalin approximately NaCl; equilibrium between the oxidative and reductive product), 35-50 mgL(-1) (concentration of formalin > NaCl; complete oxidation of formic acid to CO2). Hence, with the exhibition of such a dynamic sensitivity based on electrolyte, the developed biosensor acts as an electrochemical comparator showcasing a switch-like behaviour in detecting formalin levels. The threshold concentration of formalin required for the comparator effect was found to be 14.845 mgL(-1). The developed biosensor, most essentially, exhibited a versatility in quantifying formalin levels in real-time fish samples.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We reviewed the clinical features and laboratory data of cytomegalovirus pneumonia patients after allogeneic peripheral blood HSCT from March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019 at the hematology department of the Shanghai general hospital and analyze the prognostic factors. Results: Of the 411 allo-HSCT patients, 34(8.3%)developed CMV pneumonia after transplantation, including 18 men and 16 women, with a median age of 32(8-62)y. Total 14 patients had acute myeloid leukemia, 10 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 5 had myelodysplastic syndrome, 3 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 2 had aplastic anemia. The median onset time for CMV pneumonia was 53(36-506)d after transplantation. The main symptoms were cough(26 cases, 76.5%), fever(23 cases, 67.6%), and shortness of breath(14 cases, 41.2%). Only 17.6%(6/34)patients had expectoration, and 2 cases(5.9%)had no obvious symptoms in the early stage, but were diagnosed on routine chest CT examination. Twenty-eight(82.4%)patients showed signs of typical interstitial pneumonia, such as lobular central nodule and diffuse ground glass opacity; 6(17.6%)patients showed atypical imaging changes of patch, nodule, and consolidation. Further, 26 patients(76.5%)were positive for CMV-DNA, and the copy number was lower than that of BALF[1.70x10(7)(5.44x10(5)-4.45x10(9))copies/L vs 1.45x10(8)(1.10x10(7)-1.10x10(11))copies/L, P=0.004]. Thirteen(38.24%)patients with CMV pneumonia had mixed infection with other lower respiratory tract pathogens(10 strains of fungi, 6 strains of bacteria, and 1 of adenoviruses). The median follow-up duration was 12.8(0.4-46.5)months. The OS rate was 58.82%. Age >/= 40 y and high flow ventilation were independent risk factors for poor prognosis in CMV pneumonia patients(P=0.049, P=0.009). Conclusion: Bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid detection helps in improving the accuracy of the etiological diagnosis of CMV pneumonia after allo-HSCT.

Methods: FLT3-ITD-mutated leukemia cell lines(MV4-11 and MOLM13)were treated with ATRA. Flow cytometry was conducted to assess cell apoptosis. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR(RT-qPCR)and Western blot were used to detect the expression of ERS-related and autophagy-related genes and protein, respectively. Results: A low-dose ATRA further increased FLT3-ITD cells and ERS levels. ATRA acted on the ERS-related PERK/eif2a signaling pathway and continued to increase the ERS of FLT3-ITD cells, resulting in an upregulation of apoptotic gene CHOP expression. After the treatment with ATRA, FLT3-ITD protein in FLT3-ITD cells was decreased. Of the two main ERS-related protein degradation pathways, ER-associated degradation(ERAD)and ER-activated autophagy(ERAA), the expression of ERAD-related protein ATF6 in FLT3-ITD cells was not significantly changed on ATRA, whereas the expression of ERAA-related proteins Atg7 and Atg5 were significantly increased. Conclusions: ATRA further raises the ERS level of FLT3-ITD cells continuously by activating the ERS-related PERK/eif2a signal pathway and induces FLT3-ITD protein autophagy degradation through ERAA pathway, which induces apoptosis of FLT3-ITD-mutated leukemia cells.

AIMS: To analyze the potential significance of the mutational status of selected 30 genes on the disease outcome in 45 patients with RR-CLL using custom-made gene panel and sequencing on Illumina MiSeq FGx platform. RESULTS: The highest rate of mutations was observed in TP53 (n = 18; 40.0%), NOTCH1 (n = 13; 28.8%), SF3B1 (n = 11; 24.4%), ATM (n = 7; 15.6%), MED12 (n = 6, 13.3%), CHD2 (n = 5; 11.1%), XPO1 (n = 5; 11.1%), NFKBIE (n = 5; 11.1%), BIRC3 (n = 4; 8.9%), SPEN (n = 4; 8.9%), POT1 (n = 4; 8.9%), EGR2 (n = 3; 6.7%), and RPS15 (n = 3; 6.7%). With a median observation time of 45.9 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached. The 36-month estimated rate of PFS and OS were 64% and 68.2%, respectively. The overall response rate was noted in 23 patients (51.1%), while twenty (44.4%) patients achieved stability. Progression was noted in 2 (4.5%) cases. Analyzed molecular factors had no impact on PFS and OS.

As an adoptive immune therapy, CAR-T cells have the potential to overcome disease that is resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy as well as represent a viable option for those who have already reached toxicity ceilings with standard therapies. CD19-directed CAR-T cell products have been licensed for use in paediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. Many challenges remain, rightly resulting in a heavily-mined research field. These include mitigating short-term immune-mediated toxicity, maintaining durability of responses, broadening treatment accessibility and extending its applicability to other malignant settings. In this review, dedicated to marking 60 years since the establishment of the British Society for Haematology, we will focus on the contribution of our community towards the success of CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy in children. We will put current practice in CAR-T cell therapy into the context of future challenges to be addressed in order for it to fulfil its ""game-changing"" therapeutic potential.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a search for reported studies using terms such as ""adult ALL,"" ""epidemiology,"" and ""treatment"" in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and other database sources. We obtained 249 articles and 18 conference abstracts reported until December 2019. A total of 40 studies were selected to qualitatively summarize the data. RESULTS: The proportion of ALL among adult patients diagnosed with acute leukemia at reporting institutions from 16 Indian studies ranged from 7.3% to 57.8%. Most studies were performed in Northern India (n = 12), had a male preponderance (range, 57%-80%), and had a predominance of B-ALL (range, 65.2%-75.9%). The treatment protocols used for ALL included MCP-841, BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster)-90, chemotherapy plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, GMALL (German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia), and hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone). The complete remission rates and median overall survival for these protocols ranged from 46.7% to 91.4% and 7 to 46 months, respectively. The overall relapse rates were 24.3% to 57.1% within median time of 9 to 24 months, with bone marrow the most frequent relapse site. After relapse, most patients had chosen palliative therapy (range, 78.7%-96.0%). The major treatment-related toxicities included neutropenia, myelosuppression, and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results from Indian studies on adult ALL are heterogeneous, reporting a diverse incidence and poor overall outcomes using varied non-contemporaneous treatment protocols adapted from the developed world. A comprehensive countrywide approach to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up and the potential incorporation of novel therapies could improve the prognosis and outcomes of adult ALL in India.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The driving force behind cancer is considered to be a minor subpopulation of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Similar to other stem cells, these cells are self-renewing and proliferating but CSCs are also difficult to target by chemo- or radio-therapies. Cancer stem cells are known to be present in most of the cancer subgroups such as carcinoma, sarcoma, myeloma, leukemia, lymphomas and mixed cancer types. There is a wide gamut of factors attributed to the stemness of cancers, ranging from dysregulated signaling pathways, and activation of enzymes aiding immune evasion, to conducive tumor microenvironment, to name a few. The defining outcome of the increased presence of CSCs is tumor metastasis and relapse. Predictive medicine approach based on the plethora of CSC markers would be a move towards precision medicine to specifically identify CSC-rich tumors. In this review, we discuss the cancer subtypes and the role of different CSC specific markers in these varying subtypes. We also categorize the CSC markers based their defining trait contributing to stemness. This review thus provides a comprehensive approach to catalogue a predictive set of markers to identify the resistant and refractory cancer stem cell population within different tumor subtypes, so as to facilitate better prognosis and targeted therapeutic strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of CLL cases are accompanied by chemoresistance. Early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) is a crucial contributor to B-cell lymphopoiesis. This study is to explore the effect of EBF1 on CLL cell progression and its involvement in regulating the signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway. We conducted a correlation analysis between EBF1 and the clinical characteristics of CLL patients. Subsequently, EBF1 was overexpressed by transfection with EBF1 overexpression plasmid and the STAT5 pathway was also blocked by treatment with SH-4-54 in isolated CD20(+) B lymphocytes to investigate their roles in the regulation of cellular functions. STAT5, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) expression and their phosphorylation levels were determined by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. The in vivo effects of EBF1 on tumor growth were evaluated using a xenotransplant model. Downregulation of EBF1 was observed in CD20(+) B lymphocytes of CLL patients. EBF1 overexpression disrupted the activation of STAT5 pathway, as evidenced by decreased expression and phosphorylation levels of STAT5 and JAK2. Furthermore, overexpression of EBF1 repressed viability and cell cycle entry, and increased apoptosis of CD20(+) B lymphocytes by inhibiting the STAT5 pathway. Finally, EBF1 exerted antitumor effects in nude mice. Overall, our study elucidates the inhibitory role of EBF1 in CLL through inactivation of the STAT5 pathway, which may provide new targets for CLL treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, GSK3beta inhibition results in AML cell growth inhibition and myeloid differentiation. Here we identified master transcription factor PU.1 of monocyte-macrophage differentiation pathway as potential GSK3beta target. We demonstrate that GSK3beta phosphorylates PU.1 at Ser41 and Ser140 leading to its recognition and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7. This GSK3-dependent degradation of PU.1 by FBW7 inhibited monocyte-macrophage differentiation. We further showed that a phospho-deficient PU.1 mutant (PU.1-S41, S140A) neither bound to FBW7 nor was degraded by it. Consequently, PU.1-S41, S140A retained its transactivation, DNA-binding ability and promoted monocyte-macrophage differentiation of U937 cells even without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment. We further showed that FBW7 overexpression inhibited both PMA as well as M-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation of myeloid cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers, respectively. Contrarily, FBW7 depletion promoted differentiation of these cells even without any inducer suggesting for a robust role of GSK3beta-FBW7 axis in negatively regulating myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, we also recapitulated these findings in PBMCs isolated from patients with leukemia where FBW7 overexpression markedly inhibited endogenous PU.1 protein levels. In addition, PBMCs also showed enhanced differentiation when treated with M-CSF and GSK3 inhibitor (SB216763) together compared with M-CSF treatment alone.

We and others have shown that CARs with a CD28 costimulatory domain drive high T-cell activation, which leads to exhaustion and shortened persistence. This work led us to hypothesize that by incorporating null mutations of CD28 subdomains (YMNM, PRRP, or PYAP), we could optimize CAR T-cell costimulation and enhance function. In vivo, we found that mice given CAR T cells with only a PYAP CD28 endodomain had a significant survival advantage, with 100% of mice alive after 62 days compared with 50% for mice with an unmutated endodomain. We observed that mutant CAR T cells remained more sensitive to antigen after ex vivo antigen and PD-L1 stimulation, as demonstrated by increased cytokine production. The mutant CAR T cells also had a reduction of exhaustion-related transcription factors and genes such as Nfatc1, Nr42a, and Pdcd1 Our results demonstrated that CAR T cells with a mutant CD28 endodomain have better survival and function.

Overexpression of OSM and OSM receptor has been detected in various cancers including colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, myeloma, brain tumors, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hepatoblastoma. STAT3 is the main downstream signaling molecule of OSM, which operates the leading role in modifications of cancer cells and enhancing cell growth, invasion, survival, and all other hallmarks of cancer cells. However, due to the presence of multiple signaling pathways, it can act contradictory in some cancers.

The most significant toxicity is acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whose clinical symptoms mirror those occurring after HSCT. By contrast, oral acute GVHD lesions have been exceptionally described post-DLI. We report on a monocenter cohort of 12 adult patients that developed oral acute GVHD after DLI. The majority was treated for acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 29 DLI treatments were applied and the median time between the last DLI and the oral mucosal lesions was 42 days. Most patients presented these oral lesions concomitant with skin lesions and none of them had exclusive oral involvement. Oral lichenoid changes were observed in 11 patients, including plaque-like lesions and/or reticulated white streaks consistent with Wickham's striae, affecting mainly the buccal mucosa and dorsal or lateral aspects of the tongue. Mucosal histopathological findings showed a patchy-to-florid lichenoid interface dermatitis for 3 biopsied patients. Eight patients also experienced salivary gland changes. The treatment of oral lesions included high- to very high-potency topical corticosteroids in the majority of patients. Oral GVHD lesions have seldom been described after DLI, and only exceptionally in an acute setting. Our results are not consistent with those reported in the literature evaluating GVHD after DLI. In fact, oral acute GVHD lesions post-DLI appeared very common and similar to the oral lichenoid reactions of chronic GVHD following HSCT.

Annona cherimola, popularly known as Cherimoya, is an edible natural fruit rich in phytochemical components and known to possess various biological activities. Previous studies have reported the anti-cancerous effect of A. cherimola ethanolic leaf extract (AELE) on leukemia. This study aims at studying the potential anti-cancer activity of this extract in vitro in two different breast cancer cell lines, namely MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, in addition to investigating its toxicity on normal mesenchymal stem cells. METHODS: The anti-proliferative effect of AELE was evaluated via cell viability assay. Propidium iodide staining, Cell Death Detection ELISA and flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V binding were used to assess cell cycle progression, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis induction, respectively. Protein expression was determined via Western Blot analysis to decipher the underlying apoptotic molecular mechanism induced upon AELE treatment. RESULTS: The anti-proliferative effect of the extract was found to be selective on the triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) in a time- and dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 390.2 mug/mL at 48 h, with no cytotoxic effects on normal murine mesenchymal stem cells. The pro-apoptotic effect was confirmed by the increase in cellular and DNA fragmentation, flipping of the phosphatidylserine moiety to the outer leaflet, and the increase in Annexin V binding. The underlying molecular mechanism revealed the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway, as shown by alterations in mitochondrial permeability and the upregulation of cytochrome c expression. CONCLUSION: All the data presented in our study suggest that AELE exhibits a selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect on the chemo-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, providing evidence for the anti-tumor effects of A. cherimola.",,"['Younes, Maria', 'Ammoury, Carl', 'Haykal, Tony', 'Nasr, Leah', 'Sarkis, Rita', 'Rizk, Sandra']","['Younes M', 'Ammoury C', 'Haykal T', 'Nasr L', 'Sarkis R', 'Rizk S']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Regenerative Hematopoiesis, Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) & Institute of Bioengineering (IBI), School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon. sandra.rizk@lau.edu.lb.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201113,England,BMC Complement Med Ther,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,101761232,PMC7664056,['NOTNLM'],"['Annona cherimola', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Cancer', 'MDA-MB-231', 'Medicinal foods']",,2020/11/15 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2020/11/14 05:18'],"['2020/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/14 05:18 [entrez]', '2020/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Complement Med Ther. 2020 Nov 13;20(1):343. doi: 10.1186/s12906-020-03120-1.,20210721,10.1186/s12906-020-03120-1 [doi],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Annona/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fruit/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry']","['10.1186/s12906-020-03120-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-020-03120-1 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4405-5703'],,['SRDC/Lebanese American University'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amplification and/or overexpression of c-MYC is one of the most frequent genetic events in human HCC. The mammalian target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major functional axis regulating various aspects of cellular growth and metabolism. Recently, we demonstrated that mTORC1 is necessary for c-Myc driven hepatocarcinogenesis as well as for HCC cell growth in vitro. Among the pivotal downstream effectors of mTORC1, upregulation of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) and its mediated de novo lipogenesis is a hallmark of human HCC. Here, we investigated the importance of FASN on c-Myc-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In mouse and human HCC cells, we found that FASN suppression by either gene silencing or soluble inhibitors more effectively suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in the presence of high c-MYC expression. In c-Myc/Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) mouse liver tumor lesions, FASN expression was markedly upregulated. Most importantly, genetic ablation of Fasn profoundly delayed (without abolishing) c-Myc/MCL1 induced HCC formation. Liver tumors developing in c-Myc/MCL1 mice depleted of Fasn showed a reduction in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis when compared with corresponding lesions from c-Myc/MCL1 mice with an intact Fasn gene. In human HCC samples, a significant correlation between the levels of c-MYC transcriptional activity and the expression of FASN mRNA was detected. Altogether, our study indicates that FASN is an important effector downstream of mTORC1 in c-MYC induced HCC. Targeting FASN may be helpful for the treatment of human HCC, at least in the tumor subset displaying c-MYC amplification or activation.",,"['Jia, Jiaoyuan', 'Che, Li', 'Cigliano, Antonio', 'Wang, Xue', 'Peitta, Graziella', 'Tao, Junyan', 'Zhong, Sheng', 'Ribback, Silvia', 'Evert, Matthias', 'Chen, Xin', 'Calvisi, Diego F']","['Jia J', 'Che L', 'Cigliano A', 'Wang X', 'Peitta G', 'Tao J', 'Zhong S', 'Ribback S', 'Evert M', 'Chen X', 'Calvisi DF']","['Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, the Second Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun 130041, China.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Legend Biotech USA R&D Center, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, 07100 Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, 07100 Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Greifswald, 17475 Greifswald, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, 07100 Sassari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201111,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC7696085,['NOTNLM'],"['FASN', 'c-Myc', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'lipogenesis', 'mouse models']",,2020/11/15 06:00,2021/03/04 06:00,['2020/11/14 01:03'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/14 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Nov 11;21(22). pii: ijms21228467. doi: 10.3390/ijms21228467.,20210303,E8467 [pii] 10.3390/ijms21228467 [doi],"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (FASN protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthase, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Fatty Acid Synthase, Type I/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipogenesis/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']","['ijms21228467 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21228467 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6408-3613', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9588-0164']",,"['P30 DK026743/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA221916/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', 'P30DK026743/Liver Center, University of California, San Francisco', 'IG19175/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, some pre- and postnatal conditions have been identified as relevant in the etiology of ALL. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the association of caesarean sections, pre- and postnatal conditions with childhood ALL in the State of Sao Paulo. METHODS: Population-based case-control study including children that are below10 years old. Information on study variables was obtained through face to face interviews, through a questionnaire, and the State of Sao Paulo Declarations of Live Births database. The conditional and unconditional logistic regression approaches were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of the associations between caesarean sections, pre- and postnatal conditions with ALL, and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). RESULTS: We observed a weak and non-statistically significant risk for ALL among children exposed to caesarean sections (unconditional logistic regression OR 1.08; 95 % CI 0.70-1.66; conditional logistic regression OR 1.21; 95 % CI 0.72-2.02), but among children under 3 years old and born through a caesarean sections, the risk of ALL was greater (unconditional logistic regression OR 1.70; 95 % CI 0.69-4.21). A negative association for ALL was observed among children with mothers who reported 12 years of schooling or more (unconditional logistic regression OR 0.34; 95 % CI 0.16-0.69).

The hematological data showed thrombocytopenia and anemia, and the bone marrow test showed 82.5% blast cells, which were positive for CD13, CD33, CD38, and CD117. Blast cells showed negative myeloperoxidase staining and positive periodic acid-Schiff staining. A diagnosis of AML M6 was made.

This review summarizes these findings and discusses their implication as they relate to malignant hematopoiesis. RECENT FINDINGS: With human aging there is an impaired immune response, loss of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, increase in clonal hematopoiesis, and higher frequency of myeloid malignancies. Although murine models have implicated abnormalities in DNA damage repair, autophagy, metabolism, and epigenetics, studies in primary human specimens are more limited. The development of age-related clonal hematopoiesis and the risk associated with this is one of the major findings in the field of recent years. This is accompanied by changes in bone marrow stem and progenitor composition, changes in the epigenetic program of stem cells and an inflammatory milieu in the bone marrow. The precise consequences of these changes for the development of age-related malignancies are still unclear.

The adoptive transfer of engineered autologous T cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, has been remarkably successful in patients with leukemia and lymphoma with cluster of differentiation (CD)19 expression. Because of the higher number of antigen choices and reduced incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) than CAR-T cells, T cell receptor (TCR)-T cells are also considered a promising immunotherapy. More therapeutic targets for other cancers need to be explored due to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted recognition of TCR-T. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC), class I-related (MR1)-restricted T cells can recognize metabolites presented by MR1 in the context of host cells infected with pathogens. MR1 is expressed by all types of human cells. Recent studies have shown that one clone of a MR1-restricted T (MR1-T) cell can recognize many types of cancer cells without HLA-restriction.

A failure to accomplish these processes can have major consequences in reproductive health, including infertility, and development disorders in offspring. Sirtuins, a family of NAD(+) -dependent protein deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases, play key roles in genome maintenance, metabolism, and aging. In recent years, Sirtuins have emerged as regulators of several reproductive processes and interventions aiming to target Sirtuin activity are of great interest in the reproductive biology field. Sirtuins are pivotal to protect germ cells against oxidative stress, a major determinant influencing ovarian aging and the quality of gametes. Sirtuins also safeguard the integrity of the genome through epigenetic programs required for regulating gene repression, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation, among others. Although these functions are relatively well characterized in many somatic tissues, how they contribute to reproductive functions is not well understood.

Its mutated type can lead to the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is often related to malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia. Therefore, it is necessary to find new inhibitors targeting mutant IDH2. Discriminatory analysis-based molecular docking was employed to screen the ChemDiv compound library, which resulted in the identification of three new IDH2(R140Q) inhibitors with moderate-to-good IC50 values. Among them, compounds 1 and 3 displayed good selectivity against other mutant or wild-type IDH proteins. The most potent compound 1, bearing the [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin scaffold, was subjected to dynamic simulations to provide more information on the binding mode with IDH2(R140Q) , providing structural clues to further optimize compound 1 as a new mutant IDH2 inhibitor.",['(c) 2020 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.'],"['Chen, Xiaoyun', 'Wu, Xianmin', 'Gao, Jian', 'Ying, Huazhou', 'Dong, Xiaowu', 'Che, Jinxin', 'Shen, Zhijian']","['Chen X', 'Wu X', 'Gao J', 'Ying H', 'Dong X', 'Che J', 'Shen Z']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Institute of Innovative Medicine, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Institute of Innovative Medicine, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Institute of Innovative Medicine, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Hangzhou Institute of Innovative Medicine, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201113,Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,,['NOTNLM'],"['discriminatory analysis', 'inhibitors', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase 2', 'molecular docking', 'virtual screening']",,2020/11/14 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2020/11/13 05:56'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/13 05:56 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2021 Mar;354(3):e2000063. doi: 10.1002/ardp.202000063.

Using ALCL cell line models, we revealed the supporting roles for NFKB2 and the NIK pathway in some ALCL lines. To investigate the detailed activation mechanisms for this oncogenic pathway, we performed specifically designed alternative NF-kappaB reporter CRISPR screens followed by the RNA-seq analysis, which led us to identify STAT3 as the major mediator for NIK-dependent NF-kappaB activation in ALCL. Consistently, p-STAT3 level was correlated with NFKB2 nuclear accumulation in primary clinical samples. Mechanistically, we found that in NIK-positive ALK- ALCL cells, common JAK/STAT3 mutations promote transcriptional activity of STAT3 which directly regulates NFKB2 and CD30 expression. Endogenous expression of CD30 induces constitutive NF-kappaB activation through binding and degrading of TRAF3. In ALK+ ALCL, the CD30 pathway is blocked by the NPM-ALK oncoprotein, but STAT3 activity and resultant NFKB2 expression can still be induced by NPM-ALK, leading to minimal alternative NF-kappaB activation.

In the present research we investigated whether metformin would reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis that was induced by high-glucose stimulation in vitro via activation of PP2A. Primary human and rat cardiomyocytes were subject to high-glucose stimulation. Okadaic acid was used to inhibit PP2A activity. Cell viability and apoptosis was assessed using CCK-8 and by flow cytometry, respectively. Release of HMGB1, TNFalpha or IL-6 was analyzed by ELISA. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring cellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide level. PP2A activity was evaluated by Serine/ Threonine phosphatase assay system or analyzing Y307 phosphorylation level of PP2A catalytic domain (PP2Ac) by Western blot and the association between PP2Ac and alpha4 by co-immunoprecipitation. Activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway was assessed by detecting Ser32 phosphorylation level of IkappaBalpha as well as nuclear entry of p65 protein by Western blot. Activation of the GSK3beta/MCL1 signaling pathway was assessed by detecting Ser9 phosphorylation level of GSK3 beta and protein level of MCL1. We found Metformin pre-treatment attenuated human and rat cardiomyocytes apoptosis, HMGB1, TNFalpha and IL-6 release and ROS production that were induced by high-glucose stimulation, and these effects of metformin could be blocked by okadaic acid treatment. Metformin reduced the upregulation of PP2Ac pY307 and the PP2Ac-a4 association, which was not affected by okadaic acid treatment.

However, 6-MP disadvantages such as poor solubility in water, easy binding with serum proteins, short circulation time, and large toxic and side effects greatly limit the application of 6-MP. For this reason, various 6-MP nano drug-loading systems have been designed to increase the water solubility of 6-MP, extend the circulation time, and increase the bioavailability of 6-MP to a certain extent, reducing its toxic and side effects. However, its therapeutic effect in vivo and in vitro is still far from expectations, and there is a lot of room for improvement. In order to solve the above problems encountered in the clinical application of 6-MP, we have tried two ways of polymer prodrugs and drug-loaded vesicles to achieve efficient targeted delivery and treatment of 6-MP. We designed hyaluronic acid (HA)-based gluteal-skin-responsive 6-MP polymer prodrug (HA-GS-MP) for highly effective targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Hyaluronic acid is a natural polysaccharide, which has excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, and has a good ability to actively target malignant tumor cells overexpressing the CD44 receptor. 6-MP is connected to the HA chain through a vinyl sulfide bond, which is stable under physiological conditions (no drug release), and under intracellular reducing conditions, the connection bond is broken and 6-MP is quickly released. HA-GS-MP has a simple preparation process, good water solubility, long cycle time, and strong targeting ability. This GSH-responsive CD44 targeted 6-MP polymer prodrug is expected to improve the therapeutic effect on acute myeloid leukemia cells.",,"['Lu, Xueying', 'Xie, Yandong', 'Wang, Fengyu']","['Lu X', 'Xie Y', 'Wang F']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an City, 223001, Jiangsu Province, China."", 'Department of Brain Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou City, 221006, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Central Hospital of Zibo, Zibo, 255036, Shandong Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,101088195,,,,,2020/11/14 06:00,2021/06/10 06:00,['2020/11/13 05:34'],"['2020/11/13 05:34 [entrez]', '2020/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Nanosci Nanotechnol. 2021 Feb 1;21(2):1001-1007. doi: 10.1166/jnn.2021.18695.,20210609,10.1166/jnn.2021.18695 [doi],"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Liberation', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Hyaluronic Acid', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine', 'Nanomedicine', '*Nanoparticles', '*Prodrugs']",['10.1166/jnn.2021.18695 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modifications in the DNA methylation modulators are recurrent in lymphoma and leukemia, so that the distinct methylation pattern defines different types of leukemia. Generally, the role of epigenetics is less understood, and most investigations are focused on genetic abnormalities and cytogenic studies to develop novel treatments for patients with hematologic disorders. Recently, understanding the underlying mechanism of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially epigenetic alterations as a driving force in the development of ALL opens a new era of investigation for developing promising strategy, beyond available conventional therapy. OBJECTIVE: This review will focus on a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms in cancer development and progression, with an emphasis on epigenetic alterations in ALL including, DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA alterations. Other topics that will be discussed include the use of epigenetic alterations as a promising therapeutic target in order to develop novel, well-suited approaches against ALL. CONCLUSION: According to the literature review, leukemogenesis of ALL is extensively influenced by epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA hyper-methylation, histone modification, and miRNA alteration.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Fathi, Ezzatollah', 'Farahzadi, Raheleh', 'Montazersaheb, Soheila', 'Bagheri, Yasin']","['Fathi E', 'Farahzadi R', 'Montazersaheb S', 'Bagheri Y']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Young Researchers and Elite Club, Tabriz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*Epigenetic modification', '*MicroRNA alterations', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*histone modification', '*therapeutic target']",,2020/11/14 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/11/13 05:32'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/13 05:32 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2021;21(1):60-71. doi: 10.2174/1566523220999201111194554.,20211207,10.2174/1566523220999201111194554 [doi],"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones/*physiology', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Therapeutics']","['CGT-EPUB-111419 [pii]', '10.2174/1566523220999201111194554 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss-of-function mutations in MeCP2 result in Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is the main cause of mental retardation in females. MeCP2 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) constituted by six domains. Two domains are the main responsible elements for DNA binding (methyl-CpG binding domain, MBD) and recruitment of gene transcription/silencing machinery (transcription repressor domain, TRD). These two domains concentrate most of the RTT-associated mutations. R106W and R133C are associated with severe and mild RTT phenotype, respectively. We have performed a comprehensive characterization of the structural and functional impact of these substitutions at molecular level. Because we have previously shown that the MBD-flanking disordered domains (N-terminal domain, NTD, and intervening domain, ID) exert a considerable influence on the structural and functional features of the MBD (Claveria-Gimeno, R. et al.

However, uncontrolled inflammation induced by these transcription factors could lead to immune dysfunction, persistent infection, inflammatory related diseases and the development of cancers. Although the induction of innate immunity and inflammation in response to viral infection is important to control virus replication, its effects can be modulated by lymphotropic viruses including human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Kappaaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) during de novo infection as well as latent infection. These lymphotropic viruses persistently activate JAK-STAT and NF-kappaB pathways. Long-term STAT and NF-kappaB activation by these viruses leads to the induction of chronic inflammation, which can support the persistence of these viruses and promote virus-mediated cancers. Here, we review how HTLV-1, KSHV and EBV hijack the function of host cell surface molecules (CSMs), which are involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation, innate and adaptive immune responses, cell death and the restoration of tissue homeostasis. Thus, better understanding of CSMs-mediated chronic activation of STATs and NF-kappaB pathways in lymphotropic virus-infected cells may pave the way for therapeutic intervention in malignancies caused by lymphotropic viruses.",,"['Harhaj, Edward W', 'Shembade, Noula']","['Harhaj EW', 'Shembade N']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201110,Switzerland,Biology (Basel),Biology,101587988,PMC7697807,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV', 'HTLV-1', 'NF-kappaB', 'STAT', 'cancers', 'cell surface molecules (CSMs)', 'inflammation']",,2020/11/14 06:00,2020/11/14 06:01,['2020/11/13 01:03'],"['2020/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/13 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/14 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Biology (Basel). 2020 Nov 10;9(11). pii: biology9110390. doi: 10.3390/biology9110390.,,E390 [pii] 10.3390/biology9110390 [doi],,,,"['biology9110390 [pii]', '10.3390/biology9110390 [doi]']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1197-6765'],,"['RSG-16-254-01-MPC/American Cancer Society', 'RO1 CA135362/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of the oncoprotein FLT3 ITD (Fms-like tyrosine kinase with internal tandem duplications) represents a key driver mutation in 25-30% of AML patients. FLT3 is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors of lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Mutant FLT3 ITD results in an altered signalling quality, which causes cell transformation. Recent evidence indicates an effect of FLT3 ITD on bone homeostasis in addition to haematological aberrations. Using gene expression data repositories of FLT3 ITD-positive AML patients, we identified activated cytokine networks that affect the formation of the haematopoietic niche by controlling osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast functions. In addition, aberrant oncogenic FLT3 signalling of osteogenesis-specific cytokines affects survival of AML patients and may be used for prognosis.

In the case of HIV-1, the Gag protein interacts in nucleoli with the regulatory protein Rev, which facilitates nuclear export of gRNA. Based on the knowledge that RSV Gag forms viral ribonucleoprotein (RNPs) complexes with unspliced viral RNA (USvRNA) in the nucleus, we hypothesized that the interaction of HIV-1 Gag with Rev could be mediated through vRNA to form HIV-1 RNPs. Using inducible HIV-1 proviral constructs, we visualized HIV-1 Gag and USvRNA in discrete foci in the nuclei of HeLa cells by confocal microscopy. Two-dimensional co-localization and RNA-immunoprecipitation of fractionated cells revealed that interaction of nuclear HIV-1 Gag with USvRNA was specific. Interestingly, treatment of cells with transcription inhibitors reduced the number of HIV-1 Gag and USvRNA nuclear foci, yet resulted in an increase in the degree of Gag co-localization with USvRNA, suggesting that Gag accumulates on newly synthesized viral transcripts. Three-dimensional imaging analysis revealed that HIV-1 Gag localized to the perichromatin space and associated with USvRNA and Rev in a tripartite RNP complex.

We recently found germline DNMT3A gain-of-function variants in two patients with head and neck paragangliomas causing a characteristic hypermethylated DNA profile. Here, whole-exome sequencing identifies a novel germline DNMT3A variant (p.Gly332Arg) in a patient with bilateral carotid paragangliomas, papillary thyroid carcinoma and idiopathic intellectual disability. The variant, located in the Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain of the protein involved in chromatin targeting, affects a residue mutated in papillary thyroid tumors and located between the two residues found mutated in microcephalic dwarfism patients. Structural modelling of the variant in the DNMT3A PWWP domain predicts that the interaction with H3K36me3 will be altered. An increased methylation of DNMT3A target genes, compatible with a gain-of-function effect of the alteration, was observed in saliva DNA from the proband and in one independent acute myeloid leukemia sample carrying the same p.Gly332Arg variant.

How leukemic cells condition the stroma to enhance its chemoattractant properties remains elusive. Here, we show that mouse and human CLL cells promote the contact-independent stromal expression of homing chemokines. This function was strongly enhanced in leukemic cells from Emu-TCL1 mice lacking the pro-oxidant p66Shc adaptor, which develop an aggressive disease with organ infiltration. We identified interleukin-9 (IL-9) as the soluble factor, negatively modulated by p66Shc, that is responsible for the chemokine-elevating activity of leukemic cells on stromal cells. IL-9 blockade in Emu-TCL1/p66Shc-/- mice resulted in a decrease in the nodal expression of homing chemokines, which correlated with decreased leukemic cell invasiveness. IL-9 levels were found to correlate inversely with residual p66Shc in p66Shc-deficient human CLL cells (n = 52 patients). p66Shc reconstitution in CLL cells normalized IL-9 expression and neutralized their chemokine-elevating activity. Notably, high IL-9 expression in CLL cells directly correlates with lymphadenopathy, liver infiltration, disease severity, and overall survival, emerging as an independent predictor of disease outcome. Our results demonstrate that IL-9 modulates the chemokine landscape in the stroma and that p66Shc, by regulating IL-9 expression, fine tunes the ability of leukemic cells to shape the microenvironment, thereby contributing to CLL pathogenesis.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Patrussi, Laura', 'Manganaro, Noemi', 'Capitani, Nagaja', 'Ulivieri, Cristina', 'Tatangelo, Vanessa', 'Libonati, Francesca', 'Finetti, Francesca', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Visentin, Andrea', ""D'Elios, Mario Milco"", 'Trentin, Livio', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Baldari, Cosima T']","['Patrussi L', 'Manganaro N', 'Capitani N', 'Ulivieri C', 'Tatangelo V', 'Libonati F', 'Finetti F', 'Frezzato F', 'Visentin A', ""D'Elios MM"", 'Trentin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Baldari CT']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy; and.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy; and.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2020/11/13 06:00,2020/11/13 06:01,['2020/11/12 20:17'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:01 [medline]', '2020/11/12 20:17 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Apr 22;137(16):2182-2195. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020005785.,,10.1182/blood.2020005785 [doi],,IM,,"['S0006-4971(21)00866-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020005785 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2021 Apr 22;137(16):2130-2131.

However, these variables have never been prospectively evaluated. We conducted a prospective study over a period of 1.5 years in a tertiary care center of north India. Patients with CML in chronic phase, more than 18 years, and treated with imatinib were enrolled (n = 32). Age, and sex-matched controls were also included. Platelet function test was performed using two-channel Chrono-Log aggregometer 490 at four time-points: first, at diagnosis; second, after leucoreduction (total leucocyte count, <10 x 10/l) achieved with hydroxycarbamide; third, on-imatinib at BCR-ABL less than 1%; and fourth, in an independent cohort (off-imatinib) at deep molecular response (DMR) (BCR-ABL < 0.01%). Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistics (version 22.0). Median age of patients was 42 years (15-65), and M : F ratio was 1 : 1. At diagnosis, platelet function correlated negatively with total leucocyte count, but not with platelet count. As compared with baseline, platelet aggregation with ADP (2.5 mul), and collagen (2.5 mul) improved significantly after leucoreduction (P = 0.05 and 0.009, respectively). Imatinib further caused significant impairment of aggregation with ADP (2.5 mul), collagen (2.5 mul), and collagen (1 mul) (P = 0.04, 0.008, and 0.02, respectively). Patients in DMR also demonstrated a significant impairment of platelet aggregation with all the agonists as compared with controls. While leucoreduction alone can improve the baseline platelet function derangement in CML, imatinib further impairs it. Residual CML stem cells, or effect of imatinib on normal common myeloid progenitors might account for platelet function derangement at DMR.",,"['Jain, Ankur', 'Arora, Anupma', 'Singh, Jyoti', 'Patarwal, Ram N', 'Prasad, Pooja', 'Chaudhry, Sumita', 'Sharma, Monica', 'Khunger, Jitender Mohan', 'Gupta, Dipender Kumar', 'Saluja, Sumita']","['Jain A', 'Arora A', 'Singh J', 'Patarwal RN', 'Prasad P', 'Chaudhry S', 'Sharma M', 'Khunger JM', 'Gupta DK', 'Saluja S']","['Department of Haematology, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,,,,,2020/11/13 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/11/12 20:17'],"['2020/11/12 20:17 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2020 Dec;31(8):562-568. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0000000000000965.,20210519,10.1097/MBC.0000000000000965 [doi],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']","['10.1097/MBC.0000000000000965 [doi]', '00001721-202012000-00011 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no effective treatment for HTLV-1, and the osteolytic mechanisms are not fully understood. Mice expressing the HTLV-1 oncogene Tax, driven by the human granzyme B promoter (Tax(+)), develop osteolytic tumors. To investigate the progression of the bone-invasive malignancies, wild-type, Tax(+), and Tax(+)/interferon-gamma(-/-) mice were assessed using necropsy, histologic examination, IHC analysis, flow cytometry, and advanced imaging. Tax(+) and Tax(+)/interferon-gamma(-/-) malignancies of the ear, tail, and foot comprised poorly differentiated, round to spindle-shaped cells with prominent neutrophilic infiltrates. Tail tumors originated from muscle, nerve, and/or tendon sheaths, with frequent invasion into adjacent bone. F4/80(+) and anti-mouse CD11b (Mac-1)(+) histiocytic cells predominated within the tumors. Three Tax(+)/interferon-gamma(-/-) cell lines were generated for in vivo allografts, in vitro gene expression and bone resorption assays. Two cell lines were of monocyte/macrophage origin, and tumors formed in vivo in all three. Differences in Pthrp, Il6, Il1a, Il1b, and Csf3 expression in vitro were correlated with differences in in vivo plasma calcium levels, tumor growth, metastasis, and neutrophilic inflammation. Tax(+) mouse tumors were classified as bone-invasive histiocytic sarcomas. The cell lines are ideal for further examination of the role of HTLV-1 Tax in osteolytic tumor formation and the development of hypercalcemia and tumor-associated inflammation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Here, we have developed the LEukemia Artificial intelligence Program (LEAP) with the extreme gradient boosting decision tree method for the optimal treatment recommendation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). A cohort of CML-CP patients was randomly divided into training/validation (N = 504) and test cohorts (N = 126). The training/validation cohort was used for 3-fold cross validation to develop the LEAP CML-CP model using 101 variables at diagnosis. The test cohort was then applied to the LEAP CML-CP model and an optimum TKI treatment was suggested for each patient. The area under the curve in the test cohort was 0.81899.Backward multivariate analysis identified age at diagnosis, the degree of comorbidities, and TKI recommended therapy by the LEAP CML-CP model as independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The bootstrapping method internally validated the association of the LEAP CML-CP recommendation with overall survival as an independent prognostic for overall survival. Selecting treatment according to the LEAP CML-CP personalized recommendations, in this model, is associated with better survival probability compared to treatment with a LEAP CML-CP non-recommended therapy.

These processes will have led to acute worsening of oxygenation and/or respiratory acidosis together with an inability to provide safe, lung protective, mechanical ventilation. Patients with underlying chronic immunosuppression or haematological malignancies treated with ECMO for severe respiratory failure have poor short- and long-term functional and survival outcomes. Consequently, in many centres, a diagnosis of haematological malignancy is considered a contraindication to provision of ECMO support for severe respiratory failure. We present a case of a 51-year-old female who attended her local hospital with symptoms suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia. Within a few days, there was progression to severe respiratory failure, initially managed with invasive mechanical ventilation but rapidly deteriorating respiratory failure triggered referral for ECMO support. Initial investigations on ECMO demonstrated features of acute myeloblastic leukaemia with a superimposed community-acquired pneumonia.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the change point between usual and LC-predominant intact Ig-secreting MMs and other monoclonal gammopathic manifestations and the biological significance of the observation. METHODS: We conducted retrospective examination of laboratory findings in 386 MM, 27 smoldering MM, and 179 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) cases that secreted intact Igs. We recorded the highest levels of involved serum free LC, highest ratio of involved to uninvolved LC, highest concentration of involved LC per g of monoclonal Ig, and highest value for ratio of involved to uninvolved LCs divided by the monoclonal Ig concentration. Each data set was sorted into kappa- and lambda LC-associated lesions. Length of time, in months, between diagnosis and last contact with the patients having myeloma was recorded. RESULTS: Change point analysis of data revealed a subgroup of cases with distinctly higher levels of free LCs. In myelomas, including plasma cell leukemias, 16.4% of myelomas with kappa LCs and 22.3% of myelomas with lambda LCs, the LC secretion was distinctly higher than in the remaining cases, by a combination of 4 parameters, listed herein. Corresponding figures for smoldering myeloma (SMM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) were 12.5, 27.3, 3.8, and 6.8, respectively. Ten of the 13 (77%) cases of plasma cell leukemia) and all cases of IgD myeloma (n = 4) showed excess secretion of serum free LCs. Among IgG and IgA myelomas, including plasma cell leukemias, the LC-predominant lesions had shorter survival, by an average of 22.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: In total, 18.4% of MMs, including plasma cell leukemias, secrete distinctly higher amounts of serum free LCs than other intact Ig-secreting myelomas and confer significantly lower survival. Quantification of monoclonal serum free LCs may be useful in this subgroup in monitoring progress and potentially in ascertaining minimal residual disease. The findings also stress the need for separate criteria for kappa and lambda LC associated monoclonal gammopathic manifestations. The significantly shorter survival of patients with LC-predominant myelomas warrants consideration in prospective trials of treatments.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2020.

Discontinuation of TKIs is safe and is associated with the successful achievement of treatment-free remission (TFR) for some patients. Objective: To evaluate molecular recurrence (MRec) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after TKI discontinuation for US patients with CML. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Life After Stopping TKIs (LAST) study was a prospective single-group nonrandomized clinical trial that enrolled 172 patients from 14 US academic medical centers from December 18, 2014, to December 12, 2016, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Participants were adults with chronic-phase CML whose disease was well controlled with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib. Statistical analysis was performed from August 13, 2019, to March 23, 2020. Intervention: Discontinuation of TKIs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Molecular recurrence, defined as loss of major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 International Scale ratio >0.1%) by central laboratory testing, and PROs (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive tests) were monitored. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was performed on samples with undetectable BCR-ABL1 by standard real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Results: Of 172 patients, 89 were women (51.7%), and the median age was 60 years (range, 21-86 years). Of 171 patients evaluable for molecular analysis, 112 (65.5%) stayed in major molecular response, and 104 (60.8%) achieved TFR. Undetectable BCR-ABL1 by either ddPCR or RQ-PCR at the time of TKI discontinuation (hazard ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.99-6.50; P < .001) and at 3 months (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.07-11.1; P < .001) was independently associated with MRec. Molecular recurrence for patients with detectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR was 50.0% (14 of 28), undetectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR but detectable by ddPCR was 64.3% (36 of 56), and undetectable BCR-ABL1 by both ddPCR and RQ-PCR was 10.3% (9 of 87) (P </= .001). Of the 112 patients in TFR at 12 months, 90 (80.4%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue, 39 (34.8%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in depression, 98 (87.5%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in diarrhea, 24 (21.4%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in sleep disturbance, and 5 (4.5%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in pain interference. Restarting a TKI resulted in worsening of PROs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, TKI discontinuation was safe, and 60.8% of patients remained in TFR. Discontinuation of TKIs was associated with improvements in PROs. These findings should assist patients and physicians in their decision-making regarding discontinuation of TKIs. Detectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR or ddPCR at the time of TKI discontinuation was associated with higher risk of MRec; clinical application of this finding should be confirmed in other studies.

The key reason is retarded terminal erythroid differentiation, which is largely involved in the downregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insufficient iron uptake. Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) have been demonstrated to be capable of scavenging ROS via multienzyme-like activity and contain the iron element. The aim of this study was to figure out whether PBNPs can induce terminal erythroid differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells K562 and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that PBNPs were taken up by K562 cells, which reduced the intracellular ROS level in the cells, upregulated the late erythroid surface marker GYPA (CD235a) and downregulated the early erythroid surface marker TFRC (CD71), clearly indicating the occurrence of terminal erythroid differentiation. In addition, the cells became smaller in size after incubation with PBNPs, providing strong side evidence that the cells had undergone terminal differentiation. Mechanistic studies indicated that PBNP-induced terminal differentiation was associated with the upregulation of the nuclear transcriptional factor NFE2 and downregulation of GATA1, both of which are closely related to the variation of intracellular ROS levels. In conclusion, PBNPs demonstrated a novel function by effectively inducing terminal erythroid differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells, which is of great significance in improving the blood profiles of anemia patients.",,"['Wang, Tao', 'Dong, Haijiao', 'Zhang, Meichen', 'Wen, Tao', 'Meng, Jie', 'Liu, Jian', 'Li, Zhili', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Xu, Haiyan']","['Wang T', 'Dong H', 'Zhang M', 'Wen T', 'Meng J', 'Liu J', 'Li Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu H']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China. xuhy@pumc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,,,,,2020/11/13 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/11/12 12:11'],"['2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/12 12:11 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nanoscale. 2020 Nov 26;12(45):23084-23091. doi: 10.1039/d0nr06480g.,20210514,10.1039/d0nr06480g [doi],"['0 (Ferrocyanides)', 'TLE294X33A (ferric ferrocyanide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Ferrocyanides', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Nanoparticles']",['10.1039/d0nr06480g [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the technical cross-validation results for next-generation sequencing panel genes during the standardization process and the clinical validation in 823 samples of 751 patients with newly diagnosed or refractory/relapse acute myeloid leukemia. Two cross-validation rounds were performed in seven nationwide reference laboratories in order to reach a consensus regarding quality metrics criteria and variant reporting. In the pre-standardization cross-validation round, an overall concordance of 60.98% was obtained with a great variability in selected genes and conditions across laboratories. After consensus of relevant genes and optimization of quality parameters the overall concordance rose to 85.57% in the second cross-validation round.

We developed a simple HPLC-UV-based method for determining the concentration of gilteritinib in human plasma. The analysis requires the extraction of a 200-muL plasma sample and the precipitation of proteins by solid-phase extraction. Gilteritinib was isocratically separated within 10 min using a mobile phase of acetonitrile:0.5% monopotassium phosphate (KH2 PO4 , pH 3.5, 28:72, v/v) on a Capcell Pack C18 MG II (250 x 4.6 mm) column at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and monitored at 250 nm. The calibration curve was found to be linear within a plasma concentration range of 25-2500 ng/mL, with the coefficient of determination (r(2) ) being 0.9997. The coefficients of intra-day and inter-day validation were 2.3-3.7 and 1.3-5.2%, respectively. The accuracy and recovery of the assay were -9.6 to 0.1 and >81.8%, respectively. This HPLC-UV method for determining the plasma concentration of gilteritinib is simple and can be effectively applied to routine drug monitoring.","['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Yasu, Takeo', 'Sugi, Tomiyuki', 'Momo, Kenji', 'Hagihara, Masao', 'Yasui, Hiroshi']","['Yasu T', 'Sugi T', 'Momo K', 'Hagihara M', 'Yasui H']","['Department of Medicinal Therapy Research, Pharmaceutical Education and Research Center, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Eiju General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hospital Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Eiju General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201123,England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,,['NOTNLM'],"['HPLC-UV', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gilteritinib', 'human plasma']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/11/12 05:47'],"['2020/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/12 05:47 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2021 Apr;35(4):e5028. doi: 10.1002/bmc.5028.

However, the relationship between H19 and the metastatic potential and treatment options for tamoxifenresistant (TAMR) breast cancer is not completely understood. Curcumin inhibits cellular proliferation, migration and invasiveness in several cancer types, including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. The present study aimed to investigate the role of H19 in MCF7/TAMR cell epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasiveness, and to assess the ability of curcumin to inhibit H19mediated effects. Reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR and western blot analysis were conducted to detect the gene or protein expression. Cell Counting Kit8, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were performed to estimate the capabilities of cell viability, invasion and migration. H19 overexpression enhanced MCF7/TAMR cell EMT, invasion and migration by upregulating Snail. Furthermore, curcumin notably decreased the expression levels of epithelial marker Ecadherin and markedly increased the expression levels of mesenchymal marker Ncadherin in MCF7/TAMR cells compared with the control group. In addition, following treatment with curcumin for 48 h, H19 expression was decreased in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, curcumin treatment for 48 h significantly attenuated H19induced alterations in Ncadherin and Ecadherin expression levels. Curcumin also prevented H19induced invasion and migration. The present study indicated that H19 may serve as a promoting factor of EMT, invasion and migration in MCF7/TAMR cells, suggesting that curcumin may prevent H19associated metastasis. Therefore, curcumin may serve as a promising therapeutic drug for patients with TAMR breast cancer.",,"['Cai, Jiaqin', 'Sun, Hong', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Xie, Mumu', 'Xu, Chenxia', 'Zhang, Guifeng', 'Huang, Xuhui', 'Zhuang, Jie']","['Cai J', 'Sun H', 'Zheng B', 'Xie M', 'Xu C', 'Zhang G', 'Huang X', 'Zhuang J']","['Department of Pharmacy, Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

Here, we show that CpG island methylation in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) mainly occurs at promoters of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) target genes that are not expressed in normal or malignant T-cells and which display a reciprocal association with H3K27me3 binding. In addition, we revealed that this aberrant methylation profile reflects the epigenetic history of T-ALL and is established already in pre-leukemic, self-renewing thymocytes that precede T-ALL development. Finally, we unexpectedly uncover that this age-related CpG island hypermethylation signature in T-ALL is completely resistant to the FDA-approved hypomethylating agent Decitabine.

The conversion of valine to phenylalanine at the polypeptide position 617 results in the JAK2 (V617F) mutation, which often found in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). As a result of this mutation, JAK2 is constitutively activated leading to uncontrolled cell growth. The present study aimed to investigate the frequency and relationship of the JAK2 (V617F) mutation in a population of patients with MPNs in Iran. Methods: A total of 213 patients with myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs), were included in the study. Real-time PCR was used to detect the presence of the JAK2 (V617F) mutation in the genomic DNA isolated from patient peripheral blood samples. Results: Of the 213 patients with MPDs, approximately 60 (28%) patients were positive for the JAK2 (V617F) mutation. Polycythemia Vera (PV, 42.11%) was the most common MPD, followed by Essential Thrombocythemia (ET, 29.82%), Primary Myelofibrosis (MF, 12.28%), and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML, 10.5%). A significant relationship between all types of MPDs and the clinical course (p< 0.05) was observed.

A number of clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of anti-Tim-3 therapies as a single agent or combinations in solid tumors and haematologic malignancies. However, there remains a considerable lack of data on Tim-3 signalling, especially the genetic characteristics and immune microenvironment, in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein, we identified three genetic mutations in galectin-9, a major ligand of Tim-3, in six patients with DLBCL (6/188, 3.2%) that were not detected in the COSMIC database. The Oncomine database showed that the mRNA levels of Tim-3 were higher in DLBCL cells than those in normal B cells. Multiplexed immunofluorescence revealed that patients with Tim-3-expressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Tim-3(+) TILs) exhibited poor outcomes than those with Tim-3(-) TILs (p = 0.041). The median survival times of these patients were 65.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 71.2-88.6) and 79.9 months (95% CI: 54.4-75.6), respectively. Furthermore, we defined a novel subtype of exhausted T cells, named as exhausted Tim-3(+) CD8(+) T cells, and found that patients with exhausted Tim-3(+) CD8(+) T cells (median survival, 62.8 months, 95% CI: 50.0-75.6) exhibited shorter survival than those with nonexhausted Tim-3(-) CD8(+) T cells (median survival, 82.5 months, 95% CI: 72.0-92.9; p = 0.034). Overall, these findings provide the genetic status of the Tim-3 ligand in DLBCL. Patients with Tim-3(+) TILs and exhausted Tim-3(+) CD8(+) T cells exhibited inferior survival, thus highlighting the possibility of potential therapeutic applications of the inhibition of Tim-3 alone or in combination with other immune checkpoints for treatment of patients with DLBCL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Tingting Zhang et al.'],"['Zhang, Tingting', 'Ren, Tianyuan', 'Song, Zheng', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Jiao, Lei', 'Zhang, Zhenzhen', 'He, Jin', 'Liu, Xianming', 'Qiu, Lihua', 'Li, Lanfang', 'Zhou, Shiyong', 'Meng, Bin', 'Zhai, Qiongli', 'Ren, Xiubao', 'Qian, Zhengzi', 'Wang, Xianhuo', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Zhang T', 'Ren T', 'Song Z', 'Zhao J', 'Jiao L', 'Zhang Z', 'He J', 'Liu X', 'Qiu L', 'Li L', 'Zhou S', 'Meng B', 'Zhai Q', 'Ren X', 'Qian Z', 'Wang X', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, The Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, The Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, The Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, The Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", 'Panovue Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China.', 'Marvel Medical Laboratory, Tianjin Marvelbio Technology Co.

Our aim was to investigate quantitative differences in fecal bacterial compositions of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients compared to those of healthy children, so as to identify individual bacterial species that are related to the etiology of ALL. We recruited 81 subjects, including 58 patients with ALL and 23 healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected and examined by 16S rRNA quantitative arrays and bioinformatics analysis. Both Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Non-metric Multidimensional scaling (NMDS) demonstrated that the microbial composition of ALL patients deviated from the tight cluster of healthy controls. Multiple bacterial species exhibited significant changes (e.g., Roseburia faecis, Edwardsiella tarda, and Fusobacterium naviforme) in the ALL samples. Some of the differentially abundant taxa were correlated with the level of interleukin-10. The ALL cases could be efficiently distinguished from healthy controls by the random forest model based on differential species (area under ROC curve = 0.843). Taken together, the composition of gut microbiota differed from healthy controls to pediatric ALL patients. Our study identified a series of ALL-related species in the gut microbiota, providing a new direction for future studies aiming to understand the host-gut microbiota interplay in ALL pathogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Liu, Zou, Ruan, Chang, Chen, Wang, Yang, Zhang, Guo, Chen,', 'Zhang, He, Gan, Wang and Zhu.']","['Liu, Xiaoming', 'Zou, Yao', 'Ruan, Min', 'Chang, Lixian', 'Chen,

Two hundred fifty-two patients, median age 45.1 years (1.6-73.4), were enrolled from 34 Italian transplant centers. The underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia in 180 cases (71%). Donors were HLA identical or 1 locus mismatched sibling (40%), unrelated (40%), or haploidentical (20%). The first DLI was administered at a median time of 258 days (55-3,784) after HCT. The main indication for DLI was leukemia relapse (73%), followed by mixed chimerism (17%), and pre-emptive/prophylactic use (10%). Ninety-six patients (38%) received one single infusion, whereas 65 (26%), 42 (17%), and 49 patients (19%) received 2, 3, or >/=4 infusions, respectively, with a median of 31 days between two subsequent DLIs. Forty percent of evaluable patients received no treatment before the first DLI, whereas radiotherapy, conventional chemotherapy or targeted treatments were administered in 3, 39, and 18%, respectively. In informative patients, a few severe adverse events were reported: grade III-IV graft versus host disease (GVHD) (3%), grade III-IV hematological toxicity (11%), and DLI-related mortality (9%). Forty-six patients (18%) received a second HCT after a median of 232 days (32-1,390) from the first DLI. With a median follow-up of 461 days (2-3,255) after the first DLI, 1-, 3-, and 5- year overall survival (OS) of the whole group from start of DLI treatment was 55, 39, and 33%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, older recipient age, and transplants from haploidentical donors significantly reduced OS, whereas DLI for mixed chimerism or as pre-emptive/prophylactic treatment compared to DLI for AL relapse and a schedule including more than one DLI significantly prolonged OS. This GITMO survey confirms that DLI administration in absence of overt hematological relapse and multiple infusions are associated with a favorable outcome in AL patients. DLI from haploidentical donors had a poor outcome and may represent an area of further investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Patriarca, Sperotto, Lorentino, Oldani, Mammoliti, Isola,', 'Picardi, Arcese, Saporiti, Sorasio, Mordini, Cavattoni, Musso, Borghero, Mico,', 'Fanin, Bruno, Ciceri and Bonifazi.']","['Patriarca, Francesca', 'Sperotto, Alessandra', 'Lorentino, Francesca', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Mammoliti, Sonia', 'Isola, Miriam', 'Picardi, Alessandra', 'Arcese, William', 'Saporiti, Giorgia', 'Sorasio, Roberto', 'Mordini, Nicola', 'Cavattoni, Irene', 'Musso, Maurizio', 'Borghero, Carlo', 'Mico, Caterina', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bonifazi, Francesca']","['Patriarca F', 'Sperotto A', 'Lorentino F', 'Oldani E', 'Mammoliti S', 'Isola M', 'Picardi A', 'Arcese W', 'Saporiti G', 'Sorasio R', 'Mordini N', 'Cavattoni I', 'Musso M', 'Borghero C', 'Mico C', 'Fanin R', 'Bruno B', 'Ciceri F', 'Bonifazi F']","['Clinica Ematologica e Centro Trapianti, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Area (DAME) Universita di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica e Centro Trapianti, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale, Udine, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Complessa (UOC) Ematologia e Trapianto, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a carattere scientifico (IRCSS) Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Complessa (UOC) Ematologia e Trapianto, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Trial Office Gruppo Trapianto Di Midollo Osseo e Terapie Cellulari (GITMO), Genova, Italy.', 'Istituto di Statistica, Department of Medical Area (DAME) Universita di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Complessa (UOC) Ematologia con Trapianto, Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) Cardarelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa Complessa (UOC) Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria (AOU) Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Ematologia-Centro Trapianti di Midollo-Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a carattere scientifico (IRCSS) Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Unita Operativa Complessa (UOC) Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) S.

Which Lessons Can We Draw From the Reported Case?,564521,"Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemias after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) are mainly caused by recurrence of the primitive leukemic clones. More rarely, they originate from donor hematopoietic stem cells, developing the so-called donor cell leukemia (DCL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (DC-MDSs). DCL and DC-MDS can be considered as an in vivo model of leukemogenesis, and even if the pathogenetic mechanisms remain speculative, a genetic predisposition of donor progenitor cells, an altered host microenvironment, and the impairment of immune surveillance are considered the main causes. Case Presentation: We report a case of DC-MDS diagnosed 5 years after an allo-SCT from a matched related donor (patient's sister) in a patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ B-ALL). The sex-mismatch allowed us to identify the donor cell origin. At the onset, the DC-MDS was characterized by chromosome seven monosomy and NRAS, RUNX1, and BCOR mutations. Because of a familiar history of colorectal neoplasia and the variant allele frequency (VAF) of NRAS mutation at the onset, this mutation was searched on germline DNA in both the donor and the recipient, but the result was negative. Moreover, after transplant (+4 months), the patient developed severe and long-lasting chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), requiring multiple lines of treatments. Because of the severe immunosuppression, recurrent infections occurred and, lately, the patient died due to septic shock. Conclusion: This case report highlights the need, whenever possible, to evaluate the donor origin of the posttransplant myelodysplasia and acute leukemias. The potential key role of the impaired immune surveillance and of long-lasting immunosuppression appears to be emerging in the development of this case of DC-MDS. Finally, this case reminds the importance to investigate the familiar genetic predisposition in donors with a familiar history of neoplasia.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Farina, Bernardi, Gandolfi, Zanaglio, Morello, Turra, Zollner,', 'Gramegna, Rambaldi, Cattina, Polverelli, Malagola and Russo.']","['Farina, Mirko', 'Bernardi, Simona', 'Gandolfi, Lisa', 'Zanaglio, Camilla', 'Morello, Enrico', 'Turra, Alessandro', 'Zollner, Tatiana', 'Gramegna, Doriana', 'Rambaldi, Benedetta', 'Cattina, Federica', 'Polverelli, Nicola', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Russo, Domenico']","['Farina M', 'Bernardi S', 'Gandolfi L', 'Zanaglio C', 'Morello E', 'Turra A', 'Zollner T', 'Gramegna D', 'Rambaldi B', 'Cattina F', 'Polverelli N', 'Malagola M', 'Russo D']","['Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'CREA Laboratory (Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL), ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'CREA Laboratory (Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL), ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Stem Cell Transplantation, DPT of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201014,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC7591784,['NOTNLM'],"['donor cell myelodysplasia', 'immunosuppression', 'immunosurveillance', 'leukemogenesis', 'stem cells', 'transplant']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2020/11/13 06:01,['2020/11/12 05:44'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 05:44 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 14;10:564521. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.564521. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fonc.2020.564521 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fonc.2020.564521 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Case Series and Review of the Literature.,8-16,"The primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the kidney is an extremely rare neoplasm, the diagnosis of which mainly depends upon histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and cytogenetics. A handful of cases reported in the literature mention about aggressive features of this neoplasm. The purpose of our study was to review our experience in not only the diagnosis and management of the patients with renal PNET but also to highlight its propensity to involve inferior vena cava (IVC) and also present a rare occurrence of Ewing's sarcoma (ES)/PNET of the renal pelvis. The clinical, operative, and histopathology records of four patients of renal PNET treated between January 2017 and December 2019 were reviewed and data analyzed concerning the available literature. Out of the four patients treated, two had level III and IV IVC thrombus, and one had dense desmoplastic adhesions with the IVC wall. One of the cases had a rare presentation of ES/PNET of the renal pelvis. All patients were managed surgically, while only one patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and following up with remission for the last 2 years and 4 months. On IHC, cluster of differentiation-99 (CD-99) was positive in all patients, and three were positive for Friend leukemia integration-1. PNET of the kidney is primarily an immunohistopathological diagnosis. This neoplasm has an increased propensity for the local invasion of surrounding structures. A multimodality approach with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy could offer better outcomes, although the prognosis of these tumors remains poor.",['Copyright: Hota S et al.'],"['Hota, Sovan', 'Kalra, Sidhartha', 'Dorairajan, Lalgudi Narayanan', 'Manikandan, Ramanitharan', 'Sreenivasan, Sreerag Kodakkattil']","['Hota S', 'Kalra S', 'Dorairajan LN', 'Manikandan R', 'Sreenivasan SK']","['Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, JIPMER, Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, JIPMER, Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, JIPMER, Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, JIPMER, Puducherry, India.', 'Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, JIPMER, Puducherry, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201012,Australia,J Kidney Cancer VHL,Journal of kidney cancer and VHL,101695919,PMC7594836,['NOTNLM'],"['IVC thrombus', 'PNET', 'immunohistochemistry', 'multimodality treatment', 'renal PNET', 'renal pelvis PNET']","['The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to research,', 'authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",2020/11/13 06:00,2020/11/13 06:01,['2020/11/12 05:44'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 05:44 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,J Kidney Cancer VHL. 2020 Oct 12;7(4):8-16. doi: 10.15586/jkcvhl.2020.153. eCollection 2020.,,10.15586/jkcvhl.2020.153 [doi],,,,"['10.15586/jkcvhl.2020.153 [doi]', 'JKCVHL-7-008 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most ATLL cases are CD4-positive and CD8-negative. Though rare, there are a few dual negative (CD4-CD8-), dual positive (CD4+CD8+), and CD4-CD8+ cases reported in literature. ATLL is associated with HTLV-1 infection, but HTLV-1 alone cannot cause the malignant transformation of infected T cells. Additional genetic and/or epigenetic events are required for the development of the disease. Here, we report an unusual CD4-CD8+ATLL in a 76-year-old male with a unique molecular genetic profile. Molecular studies revealed alterations in 10 genes. Three of them are predicted to be pathogenic by the computational models, including the frameshift change in ZFHX4 and missense mutations in RHOA and POT1. The specific mutations of POT1 (c.281A > G; p.Q94R), RHOA (c.47G > A; p.C16Y), and ZFHX4 (c.2871delC; p.F958Sfs ( *) 31) have never been previously reported in ATLL to the best of our knowledge. The clinical significance of other genetic alterations is unknown. Further research is warranted to correlate this patient's molecular findings with other ATLL cases.

Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is a disease predisposing to MCC. According to previous reports, headache and focal neurological deficits suggest disease progression to the brain. We present a patient with MCC whose seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. Case Presentation. A 62-year-old female patient had a history of CLL. A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of MCC. She was admitted to the neurology department with her first GM seizure. The cranial MRI/MRA showed bone metastases in the right parietal and both frontal areas, compressing the brain. Flow cytometry of CSF did not reveal metastasis of MCC. Conclusions: The case history of the patient was unique even among the rare cases of MCC with neurological involvement. The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain.

While the functions of alphabetaT cells are extensively studied, the role of donor gammadeltaT cells in allo-HSCT is less well defined. Using TCRdelta(-/-) donors lacking gammadeltaT cells, we demonstrated that donor gammadeltaT cells were critical in mediating graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect during allo-HSCT. In the absence of donor gammadeltaT cells, IFN-gamma production by CD8(+) T cells was severely impaired. Vgamma4 subset was the major gammadeltaT cell subset mediating the GVL effect in vivo, which was partially dependent on IL-17A. Meanwhile, donor gammadeltaT cells could mitigate acute GVHD in a murine allo-HSCT model by suppressing CD4(+) T cell activation and the major gammadeltaT cell subset that exerted this protective function was also Vgamma4 gammadeltaT cells. Therefore, our findings provide evidence that donor gammadeltaT cells, especially Vgamma4 subset, can enhance GVL effect and mitigate aGVHD during allo-HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Song, Zhu, Hu, Liu, Lin, Jin, Yin, Dong, Wu and Liu.']","['Song, Yuan', 'Zhu, Ying', 'Hu, Bo', 'Liu, Yonghao', 'Lin, Dandan', 'Jin, Ziqi', 'Yin, Zhinan', 'Dong, Chen', 'Wu, Depei', 'Liu, Haiyan']","['Song Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Hu B', 'Liu Y', 'Lin D', 'Jin Z', 'Yin Z', 'Dong C', 'Wu D', 'Liu H']","['Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', ""Zhuhai Precision Medical Center, Zhuhai People's Hospital (Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated With Jinan University), Jinan University, Zhuhai, China."", 'The Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Faculty of Medical Science, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Immunology Programme, Life Sciences Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201016,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC7596318,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-17', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*gammadeltaT cells']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/11/12 05:42'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Oct 16;11:558143. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.558143. eCollection 2020.,20210514,10.3389/fimmu.2020.558143 [doi],"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.558143 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diorcinol N (DN), a fungal secondary metabolite isolated from an endophytic fungus, Arthrinium arundinis, exhibits robust anticancer activity. However, the anticancer mechanism of DN remains unclear. In this study, we examined the growth-inhibitory effect of DN on different human cancer cell lines. We found that DN decreased the viability of A3 T-cell leukemia cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis indicated that DN modulated the transcriptome of A3 cells. In total, 9,340 differentially expressed genes were found, among which 4,378 downregulated genes and 4,962 upregulated genes were mainly involved in autophagy, cell cycle, and DNA replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DN induced autophagy, cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase, and downregulated the expression of autophagy- and cell cycle-related genes in A3 cells. By labeling A3 cells with acridine orange/ethidium bromide, Hoechst 33,258, and monodansylcadaverine and via transmission electron microscopy, we found that DN increased plasma membrane permeability, structural disorganization, vacuolation, and autophagosome formation. Our study provides evidence for the mechanism of anticancer activity of DN in T-cell leukemia (A3) cells and demonstrates the promise of DN as a lead or even candidate molecule for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Yuan, Li, Xu, Hou, Zhang, Xue, Liu and Zhang.']","['Yuan, Xiao-Long', 'Li, Xiu-Qi', 'Xu, Kuo', 'Hou, Xiao-Dong', 'Zhang, Zhong-Feng', 'Xue, Lin', 'Liu, Xin-Min', 'Zhang, Peng']","['Yuan XL', 'Li XQ', 'Xu K', 'Hou XD', 'Zhang ZF', 'Xue L', 'Liu XM', 'Zhang P']","['Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Wannan Tobacco Group Company Limited, Xuancheng, China.', 'Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.', 'Tobacco Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qingdao, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201015,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC7593552,['NOTNLM'],"['G1/S phase arrest', 'acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'autophagy', 'diorcinol N', 'transcriptome profiling']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2020/11/13 06:01,['2020/11/12 05:41'],"['2020/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Oct 15;11:570450. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.570450. eCollection 2020.,,10.3389/fphar.2020.570450 [doi],,,,['10.3389/fphar.2020.570450 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-transplant debulking treatment have been employed for advanced MDS and we previously reported that marrow response (blast </= 5%) following the bridging therapy with hypomethylating agent was an independent favorable factor for survival; however, it is still not clear which patients will respond to hypomethylating agent and which genomic features can predict the response. In this study, we performed RNAseq for 23 MDS patients among which 14 (61%) and 9 (39%) patients showed marrow complete remission and primary resistance to azacitidine, respectively. Differential expression-based analyses of treatment-naive, baseline gene expression profiles revealed that molecular functions representing mitochondria and apoptosis were up-regulated in responders. In contrast, we identified genes involved in the Wnt pathway were relatively up-regulated in non-responders. In independent validation cohorts of MDS patients, the expression of gene sets specific to non-responders and responders distinguished the patients with favorable prognosis and those responded to azacitidine highlighting the prognostic and predictive implication. In addition, a systems biology approach identified genes involved in ubiquitination, such as UBC and PFDN2, which may be key players in the regulation of differential gene expression in treatment responders and non-responders.

The virus may cause thrombocytopenia either by destroying the platelets or by interfering with their generation via the process of megakaryopoiesis. MEG-01 is the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line that can be differentiated in vitro by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment to produce platelet-like-particles (PLPs). We have studied DENV infection of MEG-01 cells to understand its effect on megakaryopoiesis and the generation of PLPs. We observed that DENV could infect only naive MEG-01 cells, and differentiated cells were refractory to virus infection/replication. However, DENV-infected MEG-01 cells, when induced for differentiation with PMA, supported an enhanced viral replication. Following the virus infection, the MEG-01 cells showed a marked reduction in the surface expression of platelet markers (CD41, CD42a, and CD61), a decreased polyploidy, and significantly reduced PLP counts. DENV infection caused an enhanced Notch signaling in MEG-01 cells where the virus envelope protein was shown to interact with TAL-1, a host protein important for megakaryopoiesis.

The UBL conjugation cascade is initiated by a family of ATP-dependent enzymes termed E1 activating enzymes and executed by the downstream E2-conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases. Despite their druggability and their key position at the apex of the cascade, pharmacologic modulation of E1s with potent and selective drugs has remained elusive until 2009. Among the eight E1 enzymes identified so far, those initiating ubiquitylation (UBA1), SUMOylation (SAE), and neddylation (NAE) are the most characterized and are implicated in various aspects of cancer biology. To date, over 40 inhibitors have been reported to target UBA1, SAE, and NAE, including the NAE inhibitor pevonedistat, evaluated in more than 30 clinical trials. In this Review, we discuss E1 enzymes, the rationale for their therapeutic targeting in cancer, and their different inhibitors, with emphasis on the pharmacologic properties of adenosine sulfamates and their unique mechanism of action, termed substrate-assisted inhibition. Moreover, we highlight other less-characterized E1s-UBA6, UBA7, UBA4, UBA5, and autophagy-related protein 7-and the opportunities for targeting these enzymes in cancer. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The clinical successes of proteasome inhibitors in cancer therapy and the emerging resistance to these agents have prompted the exploration of other signaling nodes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system including E1 enzymes. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the biology of different E1 enzymes, their roles in cancer, and how to translate this knowledge into novel therapeutic strategies with potential implications in cancer treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Barghout, Samir H', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Barghout SH', 'Schimmer AD']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (S.H.B., A.D.S.); Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (S.H.B., A.D.S.); and Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt (S.H.B.).', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (S.H.B., A.D.S.); Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (S.H.B., A.D.S.); and Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt (S.H.B.) aaron.schimmer@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Pharmacol Rev,Pharmacological reviews,0421737,,,,"['A.D.S. has received honorariums or consulting fees from Novartis, Jazz, Otsuka,', 'and Takeda Pharmaceuticals and research support from Medivir AB and Takeda', 'Pharmaceuticals.

Progress, however, has been hampered by low efficacy and high toxicity. Tumor targeting by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, a conserved T-cell subset with potent intrinsic antitumor properties, mediated by a bispecific antibody represents a novel approach promising high efficacy with limited toxicity. Here, we describe the generation of a bispecific Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell engager directed against CD40, which, due to its overexpression and biological footprint in malignant B cells, represents an attractive target. The CD40-targeting moiety of the bispecific antibody was selected because it can prevent CD40L-induced prosurvival signaling and reduce CD40-mediated resistance of CLL cells to venetoclax. Selective activation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in the presence of CD40(+) tumor cells induced potent Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell degranulation, cytotoxicity against CLL and MM cells in vitro, and in vivo control of MM in a xenograft model. The CD40-bispecific gammadelta T-cell engager demonstrated lysis of leukemic cells by autologous Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells present in patient-derived samples. Taken together, our CD40 bispecific gammadelta T-cell engager increased the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptosis and induced a potent Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-dependent antileukemic response.

METHODS: A total of 100 patients with CML treated with imatinib were enrolled in this study, including 50 patients with cytogenetic relapse (study group) and 50 without cytogenetic relapse (control group) during the follow-up for 45 months. For all the patients, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of C1236T, C3435T, and G2677T/A loci in the MDR1 gene and A6986G locus in CYP3A5 gene were genotyped and the trough levels of imatinib was measured using LC-MS/MS. The relationship between SNPs of the loci and the risk of cytogenetic relapse were analyzed. RESULTS: The risk of cytogenetic recurrence was significantly higher in patients with CC genotypes of MDR1-C1236T and MDR1-C3435T than in those with CT + TT genotypes (P < 0.05). The median survival time of the patients with TT genotypes of MDR1-C3435T and MDR1-C1236T was significantly higher than that of patients with CC genotypes and CT genotypes (P < 0.05). The incidences of hematologic toxicity and neutropenia were significantly higher in patients with cytogenetic relapse than in those without cytogenetic relapse (P < 0.05). MDR1-C3435T genotype and imatinib concentration were independent predictors of cytogenetic relapse of CML. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of cytogenetic relapse of CML was significantly affected by SNPs of C1236T and C3435T loci of MDR1 gene and blood imatinib concentration.

Recent development of inhibitors of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) has revived interest in differentiation therapy of non-APL AML. Our previous studies demonstrated that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAr) induced differentiation of monocytic cell lines by activating the ATR/Chk1 via pyrimidine depletion. In the present study, the effects of AICAr on the viability and differentiation of primary AML blasts isolated from bone marrow of patients with non-APL AML were tested and compared with the effects of DHODH inhibitor brequinar and ATRA. METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from 35 patients and leukemia blasts were cultured ex vivo. The cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and AML cell differentiation was determined by flow cytometry and morphological analyses. RNA sequencing and partial data analysis were conducted using ClusterProfiler package. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. RESULTS: AICAr is capable of triggering differentiation in samples of bone marrow blasts cultured ex vivo that were resistant to ATRA. AICAr-induced differentiation correlates with proliferation and sensitivity to DHODH inhibition. RNA-seq data obtained in primary AML blasts confirmed that AICAr treatment induced downregulation of pyrimidine metabolism pathways together with an upregulation of gene set involved in hematopoietic cell lineage. CONCLUSION: AICAr induces differentiation in a subset of primary non-APL AML blasts, and these effects correlate with sensitivity to a well-known, potent DHODH inhibitor.",,"['Dembitz, Vilma', 'Lalic, Hrvoje', 'Kodvanj, Ivan', 'Tomic, Barbara', 'Batinic, Josip', 'Dubravcic, Klara', 'Batinic, Drago', 'Bedalov, Antonio', 'Visnjic, Dora']","['Dembitz V', 'Lalic H', 'Kodvanj I', 'Tomic B', 'Batinic J', 'Dubravcic K', 'Batinic D', 'Bedalov A', 'Visnjic D']","['Croatian Institute for Brain Research, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, 10 000, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Croatian Institute for Brain Research, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, 10 000, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Croatian Institute for Brain Research, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, 10 000, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Croatian Institute for Brain Research, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, 10 000, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Laboratory Immunology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Laboratory Immunology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Croatian Institute for Brain Research, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, 10 000, Zagreb, Croatia. visnjic@mef.hr.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia. visnjic@mef.hr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201111,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC7657321,['NOTNLM'],"['AICAr', 'ATRA', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Brequinar', 'Differentiation']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/11/12 05:30'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Nov 11;20(1):1090. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07533-6.,20210510,10.1186/s12885-020-07533-6 [doi],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)']",IM,"['Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA-Seq', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07533-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07533-6 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2207-7191'],,"['R01GM117446/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', 'IP-2016-06-4581/Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost', 'R01 GM117446/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DOK-2018-01-9599/Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost', 'GA KK01.1.1.01.0007/European Regional Development Fund']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, there have been no reported cases of A. phagocytophilum infection found in both the biting tick and the patient following a tick bite. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman presented with fever following a tick bite, with the tick still intact on her body. The patient was diagnosed with HGA. The tick was identified as Ixodes nipponensis by morphological and molecular biological detection methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The patient's blood was cultured after inoculation into the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. A. phagocytophilum growth was confirmed via culture and isolation. A. phagocytophilum was identified in both the tick and the patient's blood by Anaplasma-specific groEL- and ankA-based nested polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. Moreover, a four-fold elevation in antibodies was observed in the patient's blood. CONCLUSION: We report a case of a patient diagnosed with HGA following admission for fever due to a tick bite. A. phagocytophilum was identified in both the tick and the patient, and A. phagocytophilum was successfully cultured. The present study suggests the need to investigate the possible incrimination of I. nipponensis as a vector for HGA in Korea.",,"['Lee, Seung Hun', 'Shin, Na-Ri', 'Kim, Choon-Mee', 'Park, Sungdo', 'Yun, Na Ra', 'Kim, Dong-Min', 'Jung, Dong Sik']","['Lee SH', 'Shin NR', 'Kim CM', 'Park S', 'Yun NR', 'Kim DM', 'Jung DS']","['Division of Bacterial Disease Research, Center for Infectious Disease Research, Korea National Institute of Health, Osong, Cheongju-si, 28159, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Bacterial Disease Research, Center for Infectious Disease Research, Korea National Institute of Health, Osong, Cheongju-si, 28159, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Premedical Science, College of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Bacterial Disease Research, Center for Infectious Disease Research, Korea National Institute of Health, Osong, Cheongju-si, 28159, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea. sdpark09@korea.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Chosun University, 588 Seosuk-dong, Dong-gu, Gwangju, 61453, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Chosun University, 588 Seosuk-dong, Dong-gu, Gwangju, 61453, Republic of Korea. drongkim@chosun.ac.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Dong-A University, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201111,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC7656494,['NOTNLM'],"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Human granulocytic anaplasmosis', 'Ixodes nipponensis', 'Tick bites']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/11/12 05:29'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 05:29 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Nov 11;20(1):826. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-05522-5.,20201118,10.1186/s12879-020-05522-5 [doi],"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Anaplasmosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Doxycycline/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ixodes/*microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Republic of Korea', 'Tick Bites/*microbiology', 'Tick-Borne Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Treatment Outcome']","['10.1186/s12879-020-05522-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-020-05522-5 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6373-0922'],,"['2017-NI52002-00/Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Republic of', 'Korea', 'HI16C2118/Korean Health Technology Research & Development Project, Ministry of', 'Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to participate in PE progression, whereas the precise functions and potential mechanisms of miR-20b in placental trophoblast cells as well as in PE progression remain poorly understood. In the present study, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis was used to detect expressions of miR-20b and myeloid cell leukemin- 1(MCL-1) mRNA. Cell viability was investigated by cell counting kit-8(CCK-8) assays. Cell invasion and migration abilities were determined by Transwell assays. Western blot was performed to detect MCL-1 protein expressions. The interaction between miR-20b and MCL-1 was investigated by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assay. The results of the study demonstrated that miR-20b was highly expressed in placental tissues of patients with PE. Moreover, miR-20b overexpression inhibited HTR8/ SVneo cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, MCL-1 was targeted by miR-20b, and MCL-1 restoration could partially attenuate the effect of miR-20b on HTR8/SVneo cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that miR-20b may contribute to PE through inhibiting proliferation, invasion and migration of placental trophoblast cells by targeting MCL-1. Therefore, miR-20b may be used as a notable biomarker for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PE. MiR-20b targeting MCL-1 deserves further investigation in order to explore their potential role in PE.",['Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.'],"['Zhang, S S', 'Kan, X Q', 'Liu, P', 'Yin, L Z', 'Li, Q Y', 'Xu, H Y']","['Zhang SS', 'Kan XQ', 'Liu P', 'Yin LZ', 'Li QY', 'Xu HY']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining, China."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Zhangqiu Maternity and Child Care Hospital, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Qingdao Central Hospital, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', ""Health Management Center, The People's Hospital of Zhangqiu Area, Jinan, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The People's Hospital of Zhangqiu Area, Jinan, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,,['NOTNLM'],"['MCL-1', 'miR-20b', 'preeclampsia']",,2020/11/13 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2020/11/12 04:55'],"['2020/11/12 04:55 [entrez]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2020 Sep-Oct;34(5):1709-1717. doi: 10.23812/20-231-A.,20210114,10.23812/20-231-A [doi],"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN20b microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Pre-Eclampsia/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts']","['10.23812/20-231-A [doi]', '27 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib in the setting of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-29 mL/min utilizing Cockcroft-Gault method) and end-stage renal disease are unknown. Gilteritinib is primarily metabolized by the liver through the CYP3A4 enzyme and is eliminated in both the feces and urine. Its excretion is primarily through the fecal route, accounting for 64.5% of the recovered dose. Only about 16.4% of the recovered dose has been detected in the urine of human subjects. CASE REPORT: We describe our patient case documenting the administration of gilteritinib in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hemodialysis (HD).Management and Outcomes: Our patient was initiated on single agent gilteritinib 120 mg by mouth once daily for relapse FLT3-TDK positive AML. Treatment course was complicated by pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and staphylococcus lugdunensis bacteremia requiring temporary interruption of therapy. DISCUSSION: Given that gilteritinib is metabolized by the liver and eliminated primarily in the feces, one does not expect an increase in toxicity related to impaired renal function. Although this report describes the successful utilization of gilteritinib, caution should be exercised when administering in patient populations with end organ disease, and patient comorbidities should be taken into account.",,"['Tollkuci, Eris', 'Tran, Tiffany', 'Myers, Rebecca']","['Tollkuci E', 'Tran T', 'Myers R']","['College of Pharmacy, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20201111,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'Gilteritinib', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hemodialysis']",,2020/11/12 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/11/11 17:12'],"['2020/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/11 17:12 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Jul;27(5):1255-1257. doi: 10.1177/1078155220973259.

Understanding the factors that contribute to non-adherence and establishing dynamic adherence patterns in this population are essential aspects of targeted drug monitoring and intervention strategies. METHODS: Newly diagnosed CML patients were identified in the MarketScan database and relevant covariate values extracted. Proportion of days covered (PDC) per 30-day interval was used to calculate adherence over a 12-month follow-up period. We conducted a latent profile analysis (LPA) on these PDC estimates to identify distinct, dynamic patterns of TKI adherence. Identified trajectories were grouped into four clinically relevant categories and predictors of membership in these categories were determined via multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Four broad adherence categories were identified from the LPA: never adherent, initially non-adherent becoming adherent, initially adherent becoming non-adherent, and stable adherent. Results from the subsequent multinomial logistic regression indicated that younger age, female sex, greater monthly financial burden, fewer comorbidities, fewer concomitant medications, year of diagnosis, higher starting dose, TKI type, and a longer duration from diagnosis to treatment were significantly associated with membership in at least one of the three non-stable adherent groups.

However, a number of patients with APL are resistant to ATRA but still sensitive to As2O3, and the underlying mechanisms of this remain unclear. In the present study, twodimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and other proteomic methods were applied to screen and identify the differentially expressed proteins between the retinoic acidsensitive cell lines and drugresistant cell lines. The results demonstrated that in retinoic acidresistant NB4R1 cells, the protein expression of cofilin1 was markedly increased compared with that in the drugsensitive NB4 cells. Subsequently, the effects of cofilin1 on As2O3induced apoptosis in NB4R1 cells were further investigated. The results revealed that cell viability was markedly suppressed and apoptosis was increased in the As2O3treated NB4R1 cells, with increased expression levels of cleavedpoly (ADPribose) polymerase and cleavedcaspase 12. Cofilin1 expression was significantly decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels in the As2O3treated group compared with the control. Western blotting further revealed that As2O3 treatment decreased the cytoplasmic cofilin1 level but increased its expression in the mitochondrion. However, the opposite effects of As2O3 on the cytochrome C distribution were found in NB4R1 cells. This suggested that As2O3 can induce the transfer of cofilin1 from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and trigger the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C in NB4R1 cells. Moreover, cofilin1 knockdown by its specific short hairpin RNA significantly suppressed As2O3induced NB4R1 cell apoptosis and inhibited the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C. Whereas, overexpression of cofilin1 using a plasmid vector carrying cofilin1 increased the release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm from the mitochondria in As2O3treated NB4R1 cells. In conclusion, cofilin1 played a role in As2O3induced NB4R1 cell apoptosis and it might be a novel target for APL treatment.",,"['Zhu, Huachao', 'Zheng, Xiaoyan', 'Feng, Hui', 'Wang, Wenjuan', 'Wang, Xiaoning', 'Li, Miaojing', 'Wang, Huaiyu', 'Zhao, Jing', 'He, Pengcheng']","['Zhu H', 'Zheng X', 'Feng H', 'Wang W', 'Wang X', 'Li M', 'Wang H', 'Zhao J', 'He P']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, P.R.

In this study, UTX, a demethylase for lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27) and a component of COMPASS-like and SWI/SNF complexes, played an essential role in the hematopoietic system by globally regulating aging-associated genes. Utx-deficient (UtxDelta/Delta) mice exhibited myeloid skewing with dysplasia, extramedullary hematopoiesis, impaired hematopoietic reconstituting ability, and increased susceptibility to leukemia, which are the hallmarks of hematopoietic aging. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that Utx deficiency converted the gene expression profiles of young hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) to those of aged HSPCs. Utx expression in hematopoietic stem cells declined with age, and UtxDelta/Delta HSPCs exhibited increased expression of an aging-associated marker, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and impaired repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Pathway and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses coupled with RNA-seq data indicated that UTX contributed to hematopoietic homeostasis mainly by maintaining the expression of genes downregulated with aging via demethylase-dependent and -independent epigenetic programming.

However, the action mechanism of berberine in CLL cells is unknown. The previous study has shown that berberine leads to reduced viability and elevated levels of apoptosis in PBMCs of CLL patients. CLL cells are characterized by remarkable expression of Bcl-2 and ROR1 which leads to activation and survival and increases disease progression in patients. High-level expression of miR-21 in patients with CLL is associated with a higher risk of death. Here we investigated the anticancer effects of berberine upon peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CLL patients. To evaluate the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and ROR1 using flow cytometry and western blot, PBMCs were treated with 25 muM of berberine for 24 hr. The expression levels of mir-21 were evaluated by real-time PCR. Examination of treated cells demonstrated that berberine decreased Bcl-2 and ROR1 levels. Although western blot results did not show any change in Bax as a pro-apoptotic protein, an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio indicated that mitochondrial pathway is involved in berberine-induced apoptosis of CLL cells. Interestingly, berberine could reduce the expression of miR-21 in comparison to the untreated group. Our findings describe some of the molecular mechanisms of berberine by decreasing Bcl-2, ROR1, and mir-21 which may be considered as a novel apoptosis inducer in CLL cells.","['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Mohammadlou, Maryam', 'Abdollahi, Maryam', 'Hemati, Maral', 'Baharlou, Rasoul', 'Doulabi, Ehsan Manouchehri', 'Pashaei, Mehrnoosh', 'Ghahremanfard, Farahnaz', 'Faranoush, Mohammad', 'Kokhaei, Parviz']","['Mohammadlou M', 'Abdollahi M', 'Hemati M', 'Baharlou R', 'Doulabi EM', 'Pashaei M', 'Ghahremanfard F', 'Faranoush M', 'Kokhaei P']","['Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Pediatric Growth and Development Research Center, Institute of Endocrinology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, BioClinicum, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201110,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'ROR1', 'berberin', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'mir-21']",,2020/11/12 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/11/11 06:03'],"['2020/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/11 06:03 [entrez]']",ppublish,Phytother Res. 2021 Apr;35(4):2025-2033. doi: 10.1002/ptr.6945.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects and underlying mechanism of crocetin (CRT), the critical ingredient of saffron. SpragueDawley rats were then randomly divided into four groups (n=10/group): i) Control group; ii) ATO group, iii) CRTlow (20 mg/kg) group; and iv) CRThigh (40 mg/kg) group. Rats in the Control and ATO groups were intraperitoneally injected with equal volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and CRT groups were administered with either 20 and 40 mg/kg CRT. Following 6 h, all groups except the Control group were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg ATO over 10 days. Cardiotoxicity was indicated by changes in electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns, morphology and marker enzymes. Histomorphological changes in the heart tissue were observed by pathological staining. The levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde and catalase in the serum were analyzed using colometric commercial assay kits, and the levels of reactive oxygen species in the heart tissue were detected using the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium. The expression levels of inflammatory factors and activities of apoptosisrelated proteins were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of silent information regulator of transcription 1 were measured using western blotting. Cardiotoxicity was induced in male SpragueDawley rats with ATO (5 mg/kg). CRT (20 and 40 mg/kg) and ATO were coadministered to evaluate possible cardioprotective effects. CRT significantly reduced the heart rate and Jpoint elevation induced by ATO in rats. Histological changes were evaluated via hematoxylin and eosin staining. CRT decreased the levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathioneperoxidase and catalase, and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, CRT downregulated the expression levels of the proinflammatory factors IL1, TNFalpha, IL6, Bax and p65, as well as increased the expression of Bcl2. It was also identified that CRT enhanced silent information regulator of transcription 1 protein expression. Thus, the present study demonstrated that CRT treatment effectively ameliorated ATOinduced cardiotoxicity. The protective effects of CRT can be attributed to the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Therefore, CRT represents a promising therapeutic method for improving the cardiotoxic side effects caused by ATO treatment, and additional clinical applications are possible, but warrant further investigation.",,"['Zhao, Zhifeng', 'Li, Jinghan', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Liang, Yingran', 'Shi, Jing', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Han, Xue', 'Chu, Li', 'Chu, Xi', 'Gao, Yonggang']","['Zhao Z', 'Li J', 'Zheng B', 'Liang Y', 'Shi J', 'Zhang J', 'Han X', 'Chu L', 'Chu X', 'Gao Y']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050200, P.R.

Male rats were intraperitoneally injected with ATO (5 mg/kg/day) to induce cardiotoxicity. TA (20 and 40 mg/kg/day) was administered to evaluate its cardioprotective efficacy against ATOinduced heart injury in rats. Administration of ATO resulted in pathological damage in the heart and increased oxidative stress as well as levels of serum cardiac biomarkers creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and the inflammatory marker NFkappaB (p65). Conversely, TA markedly reversed this phenomenon. Additionally, TA treatment caused a notable decrease in the expression levels of cleaved caspase3/caspase3, Bax, p53 and Bad, while increasing Bcl2 expression levels. Notably, the application of TA decreased the expression levels of cytochrome c, second mitochondriaderived activator of caspases and hightemperature requirement A2, which are apoptosis mitochondrialassociated proteins.

The co-expression of CD3 in B-cell lymphomas or CD20 in T-cell lymphomas has been rarely reported. Immature and less often mature lymphomas may incorporate the rearrangements of both B- and T-cell antigen receptor genes (dual genotype or bigenotype). Lymphoma cells with a sole genotype hardly concurrently express both B- and T-cell markers (biphenotypic lymphomas). We describe a 63-year-old female who was presented with obstructive jaundice and epigastric pain of 10 days. Initial CBC revealed 43x10<sup>3</sup>/muL white blood cells, 11.2 g/dL hemoglobin, and 88x10<sup>3</sup>/muL platelets. CT abdomen revealed hepatomegaly and suspected pancreatic mass with large retroperitoneal lymph nodal mass. Peripheral smear showed 56% lymphoid cells with blast morphology. The bone marrow (BM) aspirate smear was infiltrated by 83% immature-looking cells. BM biopsy showed interstitial to diffuse extensive infiltration by primitive-looking cells, positive for pan-B-cell antigens CD20, CD79, and PAX5 as well as the T-cell antigen CD4, CD5, CD3, while negative for all immaturity markers (CD34, TdT, and CD1a). In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER) was negative. Flow cytometry on BM aspirate showed an abnormal population (50%) expressing the B-cell antigens (CD19, CD20, CD79, CD22) and CD10, and showed lambda light chain restriction as well as the T-cell antigens cCD3 and CD4 with partial CD5. The analysis showed, also, another abnormal population of lambda restricted monotypic B cells (8%) with dimmer CD45 (blast gate) and showed the same immunophenotype (expressing the B-cell antigens), but negative for CD10, cCD3, CD5, and CD4. Conventional cytogenetic revealed complex karyotype. Molecular studies revealed rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain region consistent with a clonal B-cell population. TCR gene rearrangement analysis was equivocal concerning clonality but was not conclusive for clonal T-cell disease. Our final diagnosis was peripheral blood and BM involvement by EBV-negative high-grade lymphoid neoplasm (in leukemic phase with blast morphology) and an ambiguous immunophenotype with a differential diagnosis that may include the rare entity of bigenotypic lymphoma or an unusual case of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with aberrant expression of T-cell markers (biphenotypic lymphomas).","['Copyright (c) 2020 by S.

Unfortunately, adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-ALL have a poor prognosis, with variable responses to salvage chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic stem cell transplant. As such, the need to develop effective and well-tolerated treatments for this patient population has been of paramount importance over the past decade. In this regard, treatment options for R/R B-ALL patients have expanded considerably over a relatively short period of time, with the approvals of blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin and tisagenlecleucel occurring within only the past six years. Blinatumomab, a CD19 x CD3 bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) was the first of these immune therapies to receive approval, and for many patients, is used as first-line salvage therapy. A number of large clinical trials have demonstrated improved progression-free survival and overall survival for R/R B-ALL patients receiving blinatumomab as compared to those receiving conventional salvage chemotherapy. In addition to being approved for both Philadelphia chromosome-negative and Philadelphia chromosome-positive R/R B-ALL, blinatumomab is also the only ALL therapy that carries approval for the treatment of measurable residual disease (MRD). Although blinatumomab has changed the therapeutic landscape for adults with R/R B-ALL, a number of important clinical considerations and questions remain, including the potential role of blinatumomab in the frontline setting, mechanisms of resistance, optimal goal MRD level, the role of transplant following MRD clearance, the optimal place for blinatumomab in the context of other recently approved immune-mediated therapies, and real world outcomes for patients treated outside the context of clinical trials. These issues are the focus of ongoing studies, which will hopefully inform future clinical practice regarding the utility of blinatumomab in the treatment of B-ALL patients.",['(c) 2020 Sigmund et al.'],"['Sigmund, Audrey M', 'Sahasrabudhe, Kieran D', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana']","['Sigmund AM', 'Sahasrabudhe KD', 'Bhatnagar B']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201103,New Zealand,Blood Lymphat Cancer,Blood and lymphatic cancer : targets and therapy,101596730,PMC7648528,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BiTE antibody', 'MRD', 'blinatumomab', 'measurable residual disease', 'relapsed and refractory disease']","['Bhavana Bhatnagar reports advisory board honorarium from Novartis, Astellas, Cell', 'Therapeutics, Pfizer, Kite, and research support from Karyopharm Therapeutics and', 'Cell Therapeutics, outside the submitted work.

We assessed the expected incidence rates of leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and multiple myeloma using national population estimates and data from the Kanagawa Cancer Registry. Patients and Methods: To evaluate the effects of community aging, we compared expected future incidences of hematological malignancies in Kanagawa with other three areas, namely the Yamagata, Osaka, and Nagasaki prefectures, which have different populations and predicted aging rates. Results: The total number of patients newly diagnosed with hematological malignancy in Kanagawa in 2010 was 1970. This was predicted to increase to 2581 by 2025 and to 2712 by 2040. Trends were very similar for all three hematological malignancies. These incidence rates were predicted to increase continuously in patients aged >/=65 years from 2010 to 2040, with a 169% increase in leukemia, a 167% increase in malignant lymphoma, and a 169% increase in multiple myeloma. A continuous increase in the population aged >/=65 years was also noted in the other three prefectures.

The overall survival rate remains unsatisfactory. It is urgent to identify potential prognostic biomarkers and develop new molecular therapeutic strategies for AML. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) is a family of genes that encode intracellular transcription factors. STATs are associated with leukemogenesis, cellular transformation, and cell cycle in AML. Methods: We used sequencing data and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ONCOMINE to identify expression difference, gene variability and correlation as well as prognostic effects of STAT genes in AML patients. Then, we verified the expression difference of STAT6 between healthy control and AML patients and its prognostic impact in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and our own recruited cohort. Results: The mRNA level of STAT6 was increased in AML patients among TCGA, GEO and ONCOMINE public datasets and was found to be an independent risk factor of overall survival in all AML patients and patients who only received chemotherapy by multivariate analysis. In our study, STAT6 mRNA level was markedly up-regulated in AML patients (n=105) compared to healthy donor (n=39) (P=0.0435) as a validated cohort. Patients that only received chemotherapy in high STAT6 group showed significantly lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.0055). Conclusion: STAT6 expression was increased in AML patients.

MIR142 mutations have been recurrently detected in IDH-mutated AML samples. Here, we have used a mouse model to investigate the interaction between these two mutations and demonstrate a striking synergy between Mir142 loss-of-function and IDH2(R140Q), with only recipients of double mutant cells succumbing to leukemia. Transcriptomic analysis of the non-leukemic single and leukemic double mutant progenitors, isolated from these mice, suggested a novel mechanism of cooperation whereby Mir142 loss-of-function counteracts aberrant silencing of Hoxa cluster genes by IDH2(R140Q). Our analysis suggests that IDH2(R140Q) is an incoherent oncogene, with both positive and negative impacts on leukemogenesis, which requires the action of cooperating mutations to alleviate repression of Hoxa genes in order to advance to leukemia. This model, therefore, provides a compelling rationale for understanding how different mutations cooperate to drive leukemogenesis and the context-dependent effects of oncogenic mutations.",,"['Marshall, A', 'Kasturiarachchi, J', 'Datta, P', 'Guo, Y', 'Deltcheva, E', 'James, C', 'Brown, J', 'May, G', 'Anandagoda, N', 'Jackson, I', 'Howard, J K', 'Ghazaly, E', 'Brooks, S', 'Khwaja, A', 'Araki, M', 'Araki, K', 'Linch, D', 'Lord, G M', 'Enver, T', 'Nimmo, R']","['Marshall A', 'Kasturiarachchi J', 'Datta P', 'Guo Y', 'Deltcheva E', 'James C', 'Brown J', 'May G', 'Anandagoda N', 'Jackson I', 'Howard JK', 'Ghazaly E', 'Brooks S', 'Khwaja A', 'Araki M', 'Araki K', 'Linch D', 'Lord GM', 'Enver T', 'Nimmo R']","['UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', ""School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, UK."", ""School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, UK."", ""School of Life Course Sciences, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Institute of Resource Development and Analysis, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Institute of Resource Development and Analysis, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK. r.nimmo@oxb.com.', 'Oxford Biomedica (UK) Ltd, Windrush Court, Transport Way, Oxford, OX4 6LT, UK. r.nimmo@oxb.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201110,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC7656267,,,,2020/11/12 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/11/11 05:56'],"['2020/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/11 05:56 [entrez]', '2020/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Nov 10;10(1):19390. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-76218-8.,20210510,10.1038/s41598-020-76218-8 [doi],"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn142 microRNA, mouse)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/*physiology', 'Genotype', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics']","['10.1038/s41598-020-76218-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-76218-8 [pii]']",,,,"['MR/N000838/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '107387/Z/15/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '163011/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'PG/12/36/29444/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'C416/A20938/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '12796/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,['Sci Rep. 2021 Mar 23;11(1):6974.

In the present work, using an optimized expansion/activation protocol of human NK cells, we generate expanded NK cells (eNK) with increased expression of CD56 and NKp44, while maintaining that of CD16. These eNK cells exerted significant cytotoxicity against cells from 34 B-CLL patients, with only 1 sample exhibiting resistance. This sporadic resistance did not correlate with match between KIR ligands expressed by the eNK cells and the leukemic cells, while cells with match resulted sensitive to eNK cells. This suggests that KIR mismatch is not relevant when expanded NK cells are used as effectors. In addition, we found two examples of de novo resistance to eNK cell cytotoxicity during the clinical course of the disease. Resistance correlated with KIR-ligand match in one of the patients, but not in the other, and was associated with a significant increase in PD-L1 expression in the cells from both patients.

Few comparative analyses across all income groups and world regions have examined the availability and acquisition costs of essential medicines for treating cancers in children. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involved countries in five income groups-low-income (LIC), lower-middle-income (LMC), upper-middle-income (UMC), two high-income country groups (HIC1, HIC2). Physicians and pharmacists reported institutional use, availability, stock outs and prices (brand and generic products) of 34 essential medicines. Price comparisons used US$, applying foreign exchange rates (XR) and purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustments. Medicine costs for treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and Wilms tumour (WT) were calculated (child 29 kg, body surface area 1 m(2)). Comparisons were conducted using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Fifty-eight respondents (50 countries) provided information on medicine use, availability and stock outs, with usable price data from 42 facilities (37 countries). The extent of use of International Society of Paediatric Oncology core and ancillary medicines varied across income groups (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002 respectively). LMC and LIC facilities used fewer medicines than UMC and HIC facilities. UMC and LMC facilities were more likely to report medicines not available or stockouts.Medicine prices varied widely within and between income bands; generic products were not always cheaper than brand equivalents. PPP adjustment showed relatively higher prices in UMC and LMC facilities for some medicines. Medicine costs were highest in HICs for ALL (p=0.0075 XR; p=0.0178 PPP-adjusted analyses) and WT (p =<0.0001 XR; p=0.0007 PPP-adjusted). Medicine costs for BL were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Problems with the availability of essential medicines, dependable supply chains, confidential medicine prices and wide variability in treatment costs contribute to persistent challenges in the care of children with treatable cancers, especially in LMICs.",['(c) World Health Organization 2020.

Somatic mutations in the DNA methylation regulating gene tet-methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) are associated with response to DNMTIs, however the mechanisms responsible for this association remain unknown. Using bisulfite padlock probes, mRNA sequencing, and hydroxymethylcytosine pull-down sequencing at several time points throughout 5-Aza treatment, we show that TET2 loss particularly influences DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) patterns at erythroid gene enhancers and is associated with downregulation of erythroid gene expression in the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1. 5-Aza disproportionately induces expression of these down-regulated genes in TET2KO cells and this effect is related to dynamic 5mC changes at erythroid gene enhancers after 5-Aza exposure. We identified differences in remethylation kinetics after 5-Aza exposure for several types of genomic regulatory elements, with distal enhancers exhibiting longer-lasting 5mC changes than other regions. This work highlights the role of 5mC and 5hmC dynamics at distal enhancers in regulating the expression of differentiation-associated gene signatures, and sheds light on how 5-Aza may be more effective in patients harboring TET2 mutations. IMPLICATIONS: TET2 loss in erythroleukemia cells induces hypermethylation and impaired expression of erythroid differentiation genes which can be specifically counteracted by 5-Azacytidine, providing a potential mechanism for the increased efficacy of 5-Aza in TET2-mutant patients with MDS.

In addition, DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) activity is modulated by several regulatory proteins, including p53 and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). However, the relative role of histone tails and regulatory proteins in the simultaneous coordination of DNMT3A activity remains obscure. We observed that DNMT3A binds H3 tails and p53 or TDG at distinct allosteric sites to form DNMT3A-H3 tail-p53 or -TDG multiprotein complexes. Functional characterization of DNMT3A-H3 tail-p53 or -TDG complexes on human-derived synthetic histone H3 tails, mononucleosomes, or polynucleosomes shows p53 and TDG play dominant roles in the modulation of DNMT3A activity. Intriguingly, this dominance occurs even when DNMT3A is actively methylating nucleosome substrates. The activity of histone modifiers is influenced by their ability to sense modifications on histone tails within the same nucleosome or histone tails on neighboring nucleosomes. In contrast, we show here that DNMT3A acts on DNA within a single nucleosome, on nucleosomal DNA within adjacent nucleosomes, and DNA not associated with the DNMT3A-nucleosome complex. Our findings have direct bearing on how the histone code drives changes in DNA methylation and highlight the complex interplay between histone tails, epigenetic enzymes, and modulators of enzymatic activity.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Sixty patients with CML and 20 healthy controls were recruited in this study. BCR-ABL was assessed by quantitative rt-PCR at days 0 and 90 of imatinib therapy. Circulating miR-146a levels were assessed by quantitative rt-PCR at days 0, 14 and 90 of imatinib therapy for patients and once for controls. At day 90 of treatment, treatment response was achieved in 48 patients (80.0%). Responders had significantly lower baseline Sokal score when compared with non-responders. They also had significantly lower BCR-ABL expression at day 90 of treatment. The circulating miR-146a level was significantly lower in patients with CML than in healthy subjects and showed a significant rise after 14 days of imatinib treatment and an inverse correlation with BCR-ABL expression levels at 90 days. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline BCR-ABL (%) (OR (95% CI) 1.09 (1.03 to 1.016), p=0.006) and miR-146a at 14 days (OR (95% CI) 0.002 (0.0 to 0.09), p=0.001) were significant predictors of treatment response. Using ROC curve analysis, it was found that miR-146a expression at 14 and 90 days could distinguish responders from non-responders (AUC (95% CI) 0.849 (0.733 to 0.928) and 0.867 (0.755 to 0.941), respectively). This study reported for the first time that measurement of the circulating miR-146a expression at 14 days can predict the early response to imatinib treatment in patients with CML.

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to perform multiple primary analyses. The risk of t-AML development among LC patients was assessed using a logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to construct overall survival (OS) curves. Cox regression was used to assess the influence of various prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients with t-AML after LC-targeting chemotherapy were included. The median latency period to the development of t-AML was 35.5 months. The calculated SIR of t-AML was 4.00. Chemoradiotherapy, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), or localized/regional-stage LC was a risk factor for the development of t-AML. The median OS was only 1 month, and those younger than 65 years were predicted to have a better OS time. CONCLUSIONS: t-AML is a rare but serious late complication in LC patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. It is necessary to carry out long-term follow-up and screen for t-AML in LC patients, especially among those undergoing both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with SCLC or with localized/regional-stage LC.",,"['Wang, Huabin', 'Yin, Yin', 'Wang, Ru', 'Huang, Junbin', 'Xue, Hongman', 'Cheng, Yucai', 'Zhang, Lidan', 'Chen, Chun']","['Wang H', 'Yin Y', 'Wang R', 'Huang J', 'Xue H', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhang L', 'Chen C']","['Pediatric Blood Center, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, 628 Zhenyuan Road, Guangming, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518107, P.R.

A putative intragenic enhancer, termed JE, localized to the 3' end of the JSRV env gene, has been previously described. Herein we provide further evidence that the JE functions as a transcriptional enhancer, as it was able to enhance gene expression when placed in either forward or reverse orientation when combined with a heterologous chicken beta actin promoter. We then generated novel composite promoters designed to improve transgene expression from adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vectors. A hybrid promoter consisting of the shortest JE sequence examined (JE71), the U3 region of the JSRV long terminal repeat (LTR), and the chicken beta actin promoter, demonstrated robust expression in vitro and in vivo, when in the context of AAV vectors. AAV-mediated transgene expression in vivo from the hybrid promoter was marginally lower than that observed for AAV vectors encoding the strong CAG promoter, but greatly reduced in the heart, making this promoter/enhancer combination attractive for non-cardiac applications, particularly respiratory tract or liver directed therapies. Replacement of the murine leukemia virus intron present in the original vector construct with a modified SV40 intron reduced the promoter/enhancer/intron cassette size to 719 bp, leaving an additional ~4 kb of coding capacity when packaged within an AAV vector. Taken together, we have developed a novel, compact promoter that is capable of directing high level transgene expression from AAV vectors in both the liver and lung with diminished transgene expression in the heart.",,"['Yu, Darrick L', 'Chow, Natalie', 'Wootton, Sarah K']","['Yu DL', 'Chow N', 'Wootton SK']","['Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201106,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,PMC7694761,['NOTNLM'],"['*LTR', '*adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector', '*enhancer', '*jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV)', '*transduction']",,2020/11/12 06:00,2021/03/04 06:00,['2020/11/11 01:02'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/11 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Nov 6;12(11). pii: v12111266. doi: 10.3390/v12111266.,20210303,E1266 [pii] 10.3390/v12111266 [doi],['0 (Actins)'],IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus/*genetics', 'Liver/*virology', 'Lung/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transgenes/*genetics']","['v12111266 [pii]', '10.3390/v12111266 [doi]']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6068-4377', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5985-2406']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL cells can use microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targets to modulate microenvironmental interactions in the lymph node niches. To identify miRNA expression changes in the CLL microenvironment, we performed complex profiling of short noncoding RNAs in this context by comparing CXCR4/CD5 intraclonal cell subpopulations (CXCR4dimCD5bright vs CXCR4brightCD5dim cells). This identified dozens of differentially expressed miRNAs, including several that have previously been shown to modulate BCR signaling (miR-155, miR-150, and miR-22) but also other candidates for a role in microenvironmental interactions. Notably, all 3 miR-29 family members (miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c) were consistently down-modulated in the immune niches, and lower miR-29(a/b/c) levels associated with an increased relative responsiveness of CLL cells to BCR ligation and significantly shorter overall survival of CLL patients. We identified tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) as a novel direct target of miR-29s and revealed that higher TRAF4 levels increase CLL responsiveness to CD40 activation and downstream nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling. In CLL, BCR represses miR-29 expression via MYC, allowing for concurrent TRAF4 upregulation and stronger CD40-NF-kappaB signaling. This regulatory loop is disrupted by BCR inhibitors (bruton tyrosine kinase [BTK] inhibitor ibrutinib or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor idelalisib). In summary, we showed for the first time that a miRNA-dependent mechanism acts to activate CD40 signaling/T-cell interactions in a CLL microenvironment and described a novel miR-29-TRAF4-CD40 signaling axis modulated by BCR activity.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Sharma, Sonali', 'Pavlasova, Gabriela Mladonicka', 'Seda, Vaclav', 'Cerna, Katerina Amruz', 'Vojackova, Eva', 'Filip, Daniel', 'Ondrisova, Laura', 'Sandova, Veronika', 'Kostalova, Lenka', 'Zeni, Pedro F', 'Borsky, Marek', 'Oppelt, Jan', 'Liskova, Kvetoslava', 'Kren, Leos', 'Janikova, Andrea', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Mraz, Marek']","['Sharma S', 'Pavlasova GM', 'Seda V', 'Cerna KA', 'Vojackova E', 'Filip D', 'Ondrisova L', 'Sandova V', 'Kostalova L', 'Zeni PF', 'Borsky M', 'Oppelt J', 'Liskova K', 'Kren L', 'Janikova A', 'Pospisilova S', 'Fernandes SM', 'Shehata M', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Jaeger U', 'Doubek M', 'Davids MS', 'Brown JR', 'Mayer J', 'Kipps TJ', 'Mraz M']","['Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria;

NPM1-mutated AML exhibits unique molecular, pathological, and clinical features, which led to its recognition as distinct entity in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms. Although WHO criteria for the diagnosis of NPM1-mutated AML are well established, its distinction from other AML entities may be difficult. Moreover, the percentage of blasts required to diagnose NPM1-mutated AML remains controversial. According to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN), determining the mutational status of NPM1 (together with FLT3) is mandatory for accurate relapse-risk assessment. NPM1 mutations are ideal targets for measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring, since they are AML specific, frequent, very stable at relapse, and do not drive clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined significance. MRD monitoring by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of NPM1-mutant transcripts, possibly combined with ELN genetic-based risk stratification, can guide therapeutic decisions after remission. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry can be very useful in selected situations, such as diagnosis of NPM1-mutated myeloid sarcoma.

In two months we have performed a huge number of thorax CT scans collecting effective and equivalent organ doses and evaluating also the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of lung and other major cancers. MATERIALS AND METHOD: From February 24th to April 28th, 3224 high-resolution thorax CT were acquired. For all patients we have examined the volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol), the dose length product (DLP), the size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) and effective dose (E103) using a dose tracking software (Radimetrics Bayer HealthCare). From the equivalent dose to organs for each patient, LAR for lung and major cancers were estimated following the method proposed in BEIR VII which considers age and sex differences. RESULTS: Study population included 3224 patients, 1843 male and 1381 female, with an average age of 67 years. The average CTDIvol, SSDE and DLP, and E103 were 6.8 mGy, 8.7 mGy, 239 mGy.cm and 4.4 mSv respectively. The average LAR of all solid cancers was 2.1 cases per 10,000 patients, while the average LAR of leukemia was 0.2 cases per 10,000 patients. For both male and female the organ with a major cancer risk was lung. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impressive increment in thoracic CT examinations due to COVID-19 outbreak, the high resolution low dose protocol used in our hospital guaranteed low doses and very low risk estimation in terms of LAR.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.

Inflammation and macrophages play important roles in promoting tissue repair, but p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase's role in re-endothelialization is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wire injuries of carotid arteries and Evans blue staining were performed in macrophage-specific p38alpha-knockout (p38alpha(fl/fl)LysMCre(+/-)) mice and control mice (p38alpha(fl/fl)). Re-endothelialization of the carotid arteries at 3, 5 and 7 days was significantly promoted in p38alpha(fl/fl)LysMCre(+/-) mice. In vitro experiments indicated that both the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells were enhanced in conditioned medium from peritoneal macrophages of p38alpha(fl/fl)LysMCre(+/-) mice. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was decreased significantly in macrophages of p38alpha(fl/fl)LysMCre(+/-) mice and an IL-6-neutralizing antibody promoted endothelial cell migration in vitro and re-endothelialization in p38alpha(fl/fl) mice in vivo. Phosphoproteomics revealed that the phosphorylation level of S544/T545/S549 sites in megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) was decreased in p38alpha(fl/fl)LysMCre(+/-) mice. The mutation of either S544/S549 or T545/S549 sites could reduce the expression of IL-6 and the inhibition of MKL1 reduced the expression of IL-6 in vitro and promoted re-endothelialization in vivo. CONCLUSION: p38alpha in macrophages aggravates injury of arteries by phosphorylating MKL1, and increasing IL-6 expression after vascular injury.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

In the majority of scenarios, treatment selection for cancer patients without any type of molecular characterization is no longer conceivable. Considering the impact of sample quality on the reliability of molecular analyses and the importance of the results for the fate of an individual patient, it is surprising how sparsely preanalytical and analytical requirements are addressed scientifically. Standardization and rigorous quality assessment continue to play only a marginal role in the field. Within this review, we will systematically discuss influencing preanalytic parameters and technology setups affecting molecular test results. We will shed light on the specifics of different analytes, technical modalities, and analysis pipelines. The review will have a certain focus on broad molecular genetic tumour testing with next generation sequencing but will go beyond that including other molecular diagnostic modalities and will give a glimpse into the future of molecular testing.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is a key cytokines induced after injury and implicated in mediating inflammatory and neural regenerative responses in zebrafish. To investigate the involvement of TNFalpha in mouse retinal injury, adult C57BL/6J mice were subjected to light damage for 14 consecutive days. TNFalpha was elevated in the retina of mice exposed to light damage, which induced Muller cell proliferation in vitro. Affymetrix microarray showed that, in Muller cells, TNFalpha induces up-regulation of inflammatory and proliferation-related genes, including NFKB2, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-6, janus kinase (Jak) 1, Jak2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 1, Stat2, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 7, and MAP4K4 but down-regulation of neuroprogenitor genes, including Sox9, Ascl1, Wnt2 and Hes1. Blocking the Jak/Stat and MAPK pathways attenuated TNFalpha-induced Muller cell proliferation. These results suggest that TNFalpha may drive the proliferation and inflammatory response, rather than the neural regenerative potential, of mouse Muller cells.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Recently, these compounds have been recommended for the treatment of cancer. In the present study, we assessed the cytotoxicity of several new synthetic ciprofloxacin derivatives and the apoptosis-inducing activity of the most efficient derivative in two human myeloid leukemia K562 and KG1-a cell lines. Among the prepared ciprofloxacin derivatives, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(4-(2-((3,7-dimethyloct-6-en-1-yl)oxy)-2-oxoethyl)piperazin-1-yl) -6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (4-DMOCP) was more active compound with IC50 of 19.56 and 22.13 muM for K562 and KG1-a, respectively. Apoptotic activity of the 4-DMOCP was examined morphologically through Hoechst 33258 staining, Annexin V/PI double staining, and caspase-3 activity assays. Changes in the expression level of some apoptosis-related genes and protein, including Bcl-2, Bax, Survivin, p53, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 were evaluated by the real-time quantitative PCR (qRT PCR) and western blotting. The qRT PCR analysis showed that 4-DMOCP induces apoptosis in both cell lines via the down-regulation of Survivin and Bcl2, up-regulation of caspase-8 and -9, as well as a time-dependent increase in the Bax/Bcl2 transcripts. The mRNA level of p53 was also increased in both cell lines. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that treatment with the compound, down-regulated the protein expression levels of Bcl2 and Survivin and up-regulated the protein level of Bax in both cell lines. These findings suggest that these new compounds can be good candidates for the treatment of acute and chronic myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

In the recent past, restoring a normal life expectancy while patients are receiving never-ending targeted therapy with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors through prevention of progression to blast phase and mitigation of iatrogenic risks was considered the best achievable outcome. Now, long-term treatment-free remission with continued response off tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is recognized as the most optimal benefit of treatment. Indeed, numerous independent clinical trials provided solid proof that tyrosine kinase inhibitor discontinuation was feasible in patients with deep and sustained molecular responses.

Among the 95 patients with molecular data, mutation of TP53, present in 23%, was the only genetic alteration associated with outcomes.

Between 2009 and 2017, a total of 187 patients aged 18 to 75 years were entered into a randomized controlled study of posttransplant azacitidine if they were in complete remission. Patients randomized to the treatment arm (n = 93) were scheduled to receive azacitidine, given as 32 mg/m2 per day subcutaneously for 5 days every 28 days for 12 cycles. The control arm (n = 94) had no intervention. Eighty-seven of the 93 patients started azacitidine maintenance. The median number of cycles received was 4; a total of 29 patients relapsed on study, and 23 patients withdrew from the study due to toxicity, patient's preference, or logistical reasons. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 2.07 years in the azacitidine group vs 1.28 years in the control group (P = .43). There was also no significant difference for overall survival, with a median of 2.52 years vs 2.56 years in the azacitidine and control groups (P = .85), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed no improvement in RFS or overall survival with the use of azacitidine as maintenance compared with the control group (hazard ratios of 0.73 [95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.1; P = .14] and 0.84 [95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.29; P = .43]) [corrected]. This randomized trial with azacitidine maintenance showed that a prospective trial in the posttransplant setting was feasible and safe but challenging.

Nevertheless, as the use of drugs in clinical practice increases, the problem of relapse or of the disease being refractory to treatment is becoming apparent. This problem is closely related to the C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). AREAS COVERED: This review focuses mainly on the effect of CXCR4 on molecular-targeted drug resistance in hematological malignancies as well as the clinical efficacy of CXCR4 antagonists combined with molecular-targeted drugs. Relevant literatures published between 2006 and 2020 were searched using PubMed/Medline for this review. EXPERT OPINION: Monoclonal antibodies and non-antibody molecular-targeted drugs provide new therapeutic approaches for B-lineage malignancies and leukemia, but the clinical activity of these drugs is affected by CXCR4. In general, high CXCR4 expression or mutation inhibits the effects of molecular-targeted drugs, but there are exceptions, and in studies of proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (Bz) in multiple myeloma (MM), low CXCR4 expression or loss of CXCR4 was associated with Bz resistance (BzR) and poor treatment outcomes. Given that CXCR4 is a critical mediator of molecular-targeted drug resistance, numerous studies have combined molecular-targeted drugs with CXCR4 antagonists, which synergistically enhance the anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic effect of molecular-targeted drugs.",,"['Li, Liangliang', 'Chai, Ye', 'Wu, ChongYang', 'Zhao, Li']","['Li L', 'Chai Y', 'Wu C', 'Zhao L']","['The First Clinical Medical College of Lanzhou University , Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University Second Hospital , Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University Second Hospital , Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University Second Hospital , Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Central Laboratory, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University , Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20201110,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCR4 antagonists', '*Chemokine receptor CXCR4', '*hematological malignancies', '*molecular-targeted drugs', '*resistance']",,2020/11/11 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/11/10 17:10'],"['2020/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/10 17:10 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Dec;13(12):1387-1396. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1839885.

Furthermore, these genes also co-regulate with RUNX1 and lead to bone marrow differentiation and may contribute to the leukemic transformation. Understanding the function and full characteristics of selected genes in the group of patients with AML can be helpful in assessing prognosis, and their usefulness as prognostic factors can be revealed. The aim of the study was to evaluate CEBPA and c-MYC mRNA expression level and to seek their association with demographical and clinical features of AML patients such as: age, gender, FAB classification, mortality or leukemia cell karyotype. Obtained results were also correlated with the expression level of the RUNX gene family. To assess of relative gene expression level the qPCR method was used. The expression levels of CEBPA and c-MYC gene varied among patients. Neither CEBPA nor c-MYC expression levels differed significantly between women and men (p=0.8325 and p=0.1698, respectively). No statistically significant correlation between age at the time of diagnosis and expression of CEBPA (p=0.4314) or c-MYC (p=0.9524) was stated. There were no significant associations between relative CEBPA (p=0.4247) or c-MYC (p=0.4655) expression level and FAB subtype and mortality among the enrolled patients (p=0.5858 and p=0.8437, respectively).

We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms of TYMS gene would be associated with MTX toxicity in ALL children. METHODS: 64 children with ALL were included in this study. Genotyping analysis was conducted on three common polymorphisms: tandem repeats in the promoter-enhancer region (VNTR), 6 bp ins/del (1494del6) in the 5'UTR, and rs2790 A > G in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). The association between genetic polymorphisms and MTX toxicity was studied. RESULTS: Genetic polymorphism of TYMS was associated with hematological toxicities but not with non-hematological adverse events. A significant association between TYMS 1494del6 genotypes and incidence of neutropenia (ANC < 1700 mm(3)), infection and leukopenia was observed. Carriers of the dominant allele (Del) were 6 times more likely to develop neutropenia compared to minor genotype carriers (OR (95% CI) 6 (1.2-31.1); p = 0.04), and 4.2 times less likely to have infection, as compared to Ins/Ins carriers (OR 4.2, 95% CI (1.1-16); p = 0.04). Carriers of Del allele were 9.2 times more likely to develop grade 3 and 4 leukopenia, p = 0.02, 95% CI (1.1-75.6). Significant association was found between 28 bp VNTR and thrombocytopenia; (OR 3.3, 95% CI (1.1-10), p = 0.04). No significant association was found between TYMS rs2790 A > G genetic polymorphisms and MTX hematologic toxicities.

However, the interaction between DON exposure and immune disorders remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether acute and subacute oral exposure to DON exacerbates the development of respiratory allergy using a mite allergen (Dermatophagoides farina, Derf)-induced mouse model of asthma. The direct relationship between DON exposure and asthma development was examined following acute oral DON administration (0, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg body weight), immediately before the final mite allergen challenge. Simultaneously, the influence of subacute oral exposure via low dose DON contaminated wheat (0.33 ppm) was evaluated using the same settings. To detect the proinflammatory effects of DON exposure, we examined the total and Derf-specific serum IgE levels, histology, number of immunocytes, and cytokine and chemokine secretion. Acute oral DON significantly enhanced the inflammatory responses, including cellular infiltration into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, infiltration of immunocytes and cytokine production in local lymph nodes, and cytokine levels in lung tissues. Corresponding proinflammatory responses were observed in a mouse group exposed to subacute oral DON. In vivo results were validated by in vitro experiments using the human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and human eosinophilic leukemia (EOL-1) cell lines. Following exposure to DON, the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in BEAS-2B cells, as well as EoL-1 cells, increased significantly.

Here, we use autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome to identify a population of FAS-controlled TCRalphabeta+ T cells. They include CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative T cells and can be defined by a CD38+CD45RA+T-BET- expression pattern. These unconventional T cells are present in healthy individuals, are generated before birth, are enriched in lymphoid tissue, and do not expand during acute viral infection. They are characterized by a unique molecular signature that is unambiguously different from other known T cell differentiation subsets and independent of CD4 or CD8 expression. Functionally, FAS-controlled T cells represent highly proliferative, noncytotoxic T cells with an IL-10 cytokine bias. Mechanistically, regulation of this physiological population is mediated by FAS and CTLA4 signaling, and its survival is enhanced by mTOR and STAT3 signals. Genetic alterations in these pathways result in expansion of FAS-controlled T cells, which can cause significant lymphoproliferative disease.",['(c) 2020 Maccari et al.'],"['Maccari, Maria Elena',

Few studies have assessed whether malnutrition in pediatric patients treated for solid tumors impacts risk for TRT, relapse, and/or survival. To address this knowledge gap, this retrospective study evaluated the association between body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis, and imputed BMI during therapy, on the prevalence of TRT, specific toxicities, relapse, and survival in pediatric patients with solid tumors treated with cisplatin-containing regimens. Kaplan-Meier curves and regression models evaluated the association between patient-specific characteristics (including BMI) and TRT, relapse, and survival. The cohort included 221 patients, of whom 22% were malnourished at diagnosis (10% were underweight and 12% were obese). Most patients (60%) experienced at least one severe TRT, and 30% developed more than one severe TRT. Most patients with obesity at diagnosis remained obese during therapy (62%). In multivariable analysis, obesity at diagnosis was significantly associated with a more than threefold greater risk for developing severe TRT (p = 0.037), specifically for acute or chronic kidney injury (p = 0.014). Obesity at diagnosis and adolescent and young adult age (>/=15 years at diagnosis) were associated with worse event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.32, p = 0.024 and HR 2.28, p = 0.010, respectively) and overall survival (HR 3.69, p = 0.006 and HR 2.6, p = 0.012, respectively). Obese and older patients therefore constitute populations at risk for poorer outcomes. Prospective studies are warranted to gain further insight into the mechanism and role of obesity and adolescence in developing TRT and/or treatment failure.",,"['Bhandari, Rusha', 'Scott, Elizabeth', 'Yeh, Mei Yu', 'Wong, Kenneth', 'Rushing, Teresa', 'Huh, Winston', 'Orgel, Etan']","['Bhandari R', 'Scott E', 'Yeh MY', 'Wong K', 'Rushing T', 'Huh W', 'Orgel E']","[""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', ""Radiation Oncology Program, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', ""Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201110,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,PMC8439118,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescent and young adult', 'body mass index', 'childhood cancer', 'cisplatin', 'obesity']",,2020/11/11 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/11/10 12:11'],"['2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/10 12:11 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr;38(3):239-250. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1842952.

The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with BFM protocol over two decades at our center. We retrospectively examined the files of 421 patients by dividing them into two groups by decade of treatment, 1995-2005 and 2006-2015. After excluding 117 patients, overall, 304 patients were included in the analysis. From the first to the second decade, the proportion of patients over 12 years of age increased from 7.1% to 16.8% (p < 0.04), the high-risk group increased from 15.5% to 19.5% and patients with central nervous system leukemia increased from 5.2% to 11.4%. The relapse rate remained relatively unchanged during this period (from 12.9% to 12.7%), while the mortality rate decreased from 18.7% to 15.4% (p > 0.05) and the death rate during remission induction treatment decreased from 3.9% to 0.7%. The mortality rate of high-risk and standard-risk patients decreased from 62.5% to 34.5% (p < 0.05) and 11.1% to 3.0% (p > 0.05), respectively.

However, measuring their length and frequency in a mostly wild-type background, as occurs in many situations, remains challenging due to their variable and repetitive nature. To overcome these hurdles, we combined two powerful techniques, digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HSAFM), to create a simple, rapid, and flexible method for quantifying both the size and proportion of DNA length polymorphisms. In our approach, individual amplicons from each dPCR partition are imaged and sized directly.

Furthermore, it has been determined that dietary compositions (inflammatory and anti-inflammatory) and some micronutrients (such as vitamin D and selenium) have an effect on inflammatory and immune processes and with this background; the study was done to compare the nutritional status between age- and sex-matched with infected and non-infected HTLV-1.

In micronutrient intake, although selenium, zinc, and vitamins B12 and D were lower in the patient group than the carrier and control group, however, no significant differences were observed. In comparison with micronutrient serum concentrations, vitamins B12 and D and selenium in the patient group were lower than the carrier and control groups, but statistically, the considerable difference was found only in the selenium concentration (p = 0.001).

Chromatin compartments include transcriptional clusters whose dynamic establishment and functioning depend on multivalent interactions occurring among transcription factors, cofactors and basal transcriptional machinery. However, how chromatin players contribute to the assembly of transcriptional condensates is poorly understood. By interrogating the effect of KMT2D (also known as MLL4) haploinsufficiency in Kabuki syndrome, we found that mixed lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4) contributes to the assembly of transcriptional condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation. MLL4 loss of function impaired Polycomb-dependent chromatin compartmentalization, altering the nuclear architecture. By releasing the nuclear mechanical stress through inhibition of the mechanosensor ATR, we re-established the mechanosignaling of mesenchymal stem cells and their commitment towards chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo.

While high systemic interleukin- (IL-) 6 levels are associated with clinical cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the role of IL-6 trans-signaling within CAR T-cells has not been reported. We generated CAR T cells that constitutively express hyper IL-6 (HIL-6), a designer cytokine that activates the trans-signaling pathway. HIL-6-expressing CAR T-cells exhibited enhanced proliferation and antitumor efficacy in vitro and in xenograft models. However, HIL-6 CAR T cells caused severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transcriptomic profiling revealed that HIL-6 stimulation of CAR T cells upregulated genes associated with T cell migration, early memory differentiation, and IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling. Since IL-6 trans-signaling acts via surface GP130, we generated CAR T cells expressing a constitutively-active form of GP130 and found these retained improved antitumor activity without signs of GVHD in preclinical models of B-cell leukemia and solid tumors. Taken together, these results show that IL-6 trans-signaling can enhance expansion and antitumor activity of CAR T cells via the GP130/STAT3 pathway, and suggest that expression of GP130 within CAR T

While p210(Bcr-Abl) is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), p190(Bcr-Abl) occurs in the majority of Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) patients. In CML, p190(Bcr-Abl) occurs in a minority of patients associating with distinct hematological features and inferior outcomes, yet the pathogenic role of p190(Bcr-Abl) and potential targeting therapies are largely uncharacterized. We employed next generation sequencing, phospho-proteomic profiling, and drug sensitivity testing to characterize p190(Bcr-Abl) in CML and hematopoietic progenitor cell line models (Ba/f3 and HPC-LSK). p190(Bcr-Abl) CML patients demonstrated poor response to imatinib and frequent mutations in epigenetic modifiers genes. In contrast with p210(Bcr-Abl), p190(Bcr-Abl) exhibited specific transcriptional upregulation of interferon, interleukin-1 receptor, and P53 signaling pathways, associated with hyperphosphorylation of relevant signaling molecules including JAK1/STAT1 and PAK1 in addition to Src hyperphosphorylation. Comparable to p190(Bcr-Abl) CML patients, p190(Bcr-Abl) cell lines demonstrated similar transcriptional and phospho-signaling signatures. With the drug sensitivity screening we identified targeted drugs with specific activity in p190(Bcr-Abl) cell lines including IAP-, PAK1-, and Src inhibitors and glucocorticoids.

HVLPD patients at Seoul National University Hospital between 1988 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. This study included 26 HVLPD patients who all presented with recurrent papulovesicular and necrotic eruption on the face, neck, and extremities.

METHODS: Surgical specimens of necrotic intestinal tissues, adjacent normal intestinal tissues, and serum and urine samples were collected from 51 patients with acute intestinal necrosis, and analyzed along with the serum and urine samples from 51 healthy controls, patients with 10 different acute abdominal conditions(35 cases for each condition), and patients with breast cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and lung cancer(10 cases for each malignancy). The expression levels of H19 were measured with quantitative PCR in the collected samples. Receiver-operating characteristic(ROC)curves were used to determine the diagnostic value of serum and urine H19 levels for acute intestinal necrosis. RESULTS: The 51 patients with acute intestinal necrosis included 35 women and 26 men(mean age of 74.4 years) with arterial thrombosis as the dominant etiology(26 cases). Compared with that in normal intestinal tissues, H19 was significantly overexpressed by 11.2 times in necrotic intestinal tissues(P < 0.001). Serum and urine H19 expression levels did not differ significantly among the healthy controls, patients with other acute abdominal conditions and malignancies(P > 0.05). Serum and urine H19 levels were significantly up-regulated in patients with acute intestinal necrosis as compared with those in the other subjects included in the analysis(P < 0.001). In patients with acute intestinal necrosis, H19 levels in the necrotic intestinal tissue, serum and urine samples were significantly correlated with correlation coefficients of 0.974(tissue vs serum), 0.967(serum vs urine), and 0.917(tissue vs urine). In ROC curve analysis, the areas under curves(AUCs)of serum and urine H19 for diagnosis of acute intestinal necrosis were 0.951 and 0.915, respectively; their diagnostic sensitivities were 94% and 79.6%, respectively, and they both had a diagnostic specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute intestinal necrosis, H19 is overexpressed in necrotic intestinal tissues, from which it is released into the blood circulation and urine.

METHODS: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeting LPXN were designed and transiently transfected in SHI-1 cells via Lipofectamine 2000, and the most efficient siRNA sequence for LPXN silencing was identified using Western blotting. The protein expression levels of LPXN, p-JNK, p-P38 MAPK and p-ERK were in the cells transfected with the selected siRNA were detected using Western blotting, and the cell proliferation changes were assessed using CCK-8 reagent. RESULTS: LPXN silencing by siRNA transfection resulted in significant proliferation suppression in SHI-1 cells with an inhibition rate of(27.04+/-2.05) % (P < 0.05). Western blotting showed that treatment of the siRNA-transfected SHI-1 cells with 0-25 mumol/L curcumin or with 0-2.0 mumol/L Ara-C further increased the cell inhibition rate and obviously enhanced the expressions of p-P38 MAPK and p-JNK without significantly affecting p-ERK expression. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of LPXN expression by siRNA transfection can suppress the proliferation and increase the drug sensitivity of SHI-1 cells probably by activating JNK and P38 MAPK.",,"['Zhu, Guohua', 'Dai, Haiping', 'Duan, Yuanxun', 'Yu, Zelin']","['Zhu G', 'Dai H', 'Duan Y', 'Yu Z']","['First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,PMC6765540,['NOTNLM'],"['SHI-1 cells', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'drug sensitivity', 'leupaxin', 'small interfere RNA']",,2018/07/30 00:00,2018/07/30 00:01,['2020/11/10 05:38'],"['2020/11/10 05:38 [entrez]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/30 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2018 Jul 30;38(7):807-811. doi: 10.3969/j.issn.1673-4254.2018.07.06.,,10.3969/j.issn.1673-4254.2018.07.06 [doi],,IM,,['10.3969/j.issn.1673-4254.2018.07.06 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was made of our cytopathology database for cases of CLL that also contained a SPNLM. RESULTS: Seventeen cases from 13 known CLL patients [M:F = 2.3:1; age range: 47-77 years, x = 67 years] met criteria for this study. SPNLMs consisted of different forms of metastatic carcinoma (10 patients) and malignant melanoma (3). Of 16 FNA biopsies and 1 pleural fluid, 82% had ancillary testing; 35% had the specimen subdivided for both flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Lymph node was the most common site for FNA biopsy (12), followed by face (2), and soft tissue (2). Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common SPNLM (6), followed by melanoma (3), and there were single cases of adenocarcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. A correct specific cytologic diagnosis was made in 15 (88%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Cytopathology is highly proficient in recognizing SPNLM in CLL patients. Utilization of cytologic material for FCM and IHC is feasible, and extremely helpful in achieving diagnostic accuracy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Cytopathology.

NKG2D ligands are known markers of cellular stress and are often upregulated on tumor cells. Certain drugs can further increase NKG2D ligand levels, thereby making tumor cells more susceptible to immune cell detection and destruction. However, the effectiveness of this approach appears to be limited with drug treatment alone, possibly due to immune dysregulation in the setting of malignancies. We hypothesized that a more effective approach would be a combination of NKG2D ligand-inducing drugs, such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and ex vivo-expanded peripheral blood gammadelta T cells (i.e., Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a high-risk hematologic malignancy, and treatment has shown limited benefit with the addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy regimens. Two AML cells lines, Nomo-1 and Kasumi-1, were treated with increasing concentrations of bortezomib, and changes in NKG2D ligand expression were measured. Bortezomib treatment significantly increased expression of the NKG2D ligand UL16 binding protein (ULBP) 2/5/6 in both cell lines. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells were expanded and isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors to generate a final cellular product with a mean of 96% CD3(+)/gammadelta T-cell receptor-positive cells. Combination treatment of the AML cell lines with gammadelta T cells and bortezomib resulted in significantly greater cytotoxicity than gammadelta T cells alone, even at lower effector-to-target ratios. Based on the positive results against AML and the generalizable mechanism of this combination approach, it was also tested against T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), another high-risk leukemia. Similarly, bortezomib increased ULBP 2/5/6 expression in T-ALL cell lines, Jurkat and MOLT-4 and improved the cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells against each line. Collectively, these results show that bortezomib enhances gammadelta T-cell-mediated killing of both AML and T-ALL cells in part through increased NKG2D ligand-receptor interaction. Furthermore, proof-of-concept for the combination of ex vivo-expanded gammadelta T cells with stress ligand-inducing drugs as a therapeutic platform for high-risk leukemias is demonstrated.","['Copyright (c) 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.

Recent studies have identified promoter translocations as common drivers of high ABCB1 expression in recurrent, chemotherapy-treated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) and breast cancer. These fusions place ABCB1 under the control of a strong promoter while leaving its open reading frame intact. The mechanisms controlling high ABCB1 expression in AML are largely unknown. We therefore established an experimental system and analysis pipeline to determine whether promoter translocations account for high ABCB1 expression in cases of relapsed human AML. METHODS: The human AML cell line THP-1 was used to create a model of chemotherapy resistance in which ABCB1 expression was driven by a promoter fusion. The THP-1 model was used to establish a targeted nanopore long-read sequencing approach that was then applied to cases of ABCB1(high) HGSC and AML. H3K27Ac ChIP sequencing was used to assess the activity of native promoters in cases of ABCB1(high) AML. RESULTS: Prolonged in vitro daunorubicin exposure induced activating ABCB1 promoter translocations in human THP-1 AML cells, similar to those recently described in recurrent high-grade serous ovarian and breast cancers. Targeted nanopore sequencing proved an efficient method for identifying ABCB1 structural variants in THP-1 AML cells and HGSC; the promoter translocations identified in HGSC were both previously described and novel. In contrast, activating ABCB1 promoter translocations were not identified in ABCB1(high) AML; instead H3K27Ac ChIP sequencing demonstrated active native promoters in all cases studied. CONCLUSIONS: Despite frequent high level expression of ABCB1 in relapsed primary AML we found no evidence of ABCB1 translocations and instead confirmed high-level activity of native ABCB1 promoters, consistent with endogenous regulation.",,"['Williams, Mark S', 'Basma, Naseer J', 'Amaral, Fabio M R', 'Williams, Gillian', 'Weightman, John P', 'Breitwieser, Wolfgang', 'Nelson, Louisa', 'Taylor, Stephen S', 'Wiseman, Daniel H', 'Somervaille, Tim C P']","['Williams MS', 'Basma NJ', 'Amaral FMR', 'Williams G', 'Weightman JP', 'Breitwieser W', 'Nelson L', 'Taylor SS', 'Wiseman DH', 'Somervaille TCP']","['Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK. mark.williams-4@manchester.ac.uk.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Molecular Biology Core Facility, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Alderley Park, Cheshire, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'Molecular Biology Core Facility, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Alderley Park, Cheshire, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'Molecular Biology Core Facility, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Alderley Park, Cheshire, SK10 4TG, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Epigenetics of Haematopoiesis Group, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, Oglesby Cancer Research Building, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK. tim.somervaille@cruk.manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201110,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC7654162,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'HGSC', 'Ovarian cancer', 'Promoter translocation']",,2020/11/11 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/11/10 05:31'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/10 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Nov 10;20(1):1075. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07571-0.,20210510,10.1186/s12885-020-07571-0 [doi],"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Nanopore Sequencing/*methods', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07571-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07571-0 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9188-4379'],,"['C5759/A20971/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'KKL954/Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund (GB)', 'A19842/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'NA/Christie Charity (GB)', 'NA/Imago Biosciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the biological characteristics (such as self-renewal, apoptosis, migration, autocrine) and function (vascularization) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs) that make up BM arteriolar niche in simulated hypoxia AML context were investigated. It was found that moderate hypoxia enhanced the viability of the arteriolar niche cells, but severe hypoxia of AML BM resulted in the damage of arteriolar niche cells and the disorder of vascular cytokines C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (CXCL6). The dynamic changes of CXCL6 in the system as well as its anti-apoptotic and promoting angiogenic effects suggested that CXCL6 played an important role in the remodeling of BM arteriolar niche in AML.

FLT3-ITD(+) induces constitutive activation of FLT3, causing an abnormally rapid proliferation of cancer cells. In this study, we identified novel FLT3 inhibitors and investigated 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-phenyloxazol-2-amine (compound 7; 7c) as candidates for the treatment of AML. The results showed that 7c inhibited the activities of FLT3 and mutated FLT3 in a cell-free kinase assay and Molm-13 and MV4-11 cells, as well as the proliferation of FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells, increasing apoptosis. The anti-leukemic activity of 7c was confirmed by in vivo tumor growth inhibition in MV4-11 xenograft mice. Besides, 7c suppressed the expression of DNA damage repair genes. Combination treatment with 7c and olaparib (a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP] inhibitor) synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in Molm-13 and MV4-11 cells.

APL is mainly managed by a differentiation therapy based on the administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). However, therapy resistance, differentiation syndrome, and relapses require the development of new low-toxicity therapies based on the induction of blasts differentiation. In keeping with this, we reasoned that a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms pivotal for ATRA-driven differentiation could definitely bolster the identification of new therapeutic strategies in APL patients. We thus performed an in-depth high-throughput transcriptional profile analysis and metabolic characterization of a well-established APL experimental model based on NB4 cells that represent an unevaluable tool to dissect the complex mechanism associated with ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Pathway-reconstruction analysis using genome-wide transcriptional data has allowed us to identify the activation/inhibition of several cancer signaling pathways (e.g., inflammation, immune cell response, DNA repair, and cell proliferation) and master regulators (e.g., transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and ligand-dependent nuclear receptors). Furthermore, we provide evidence of the regulation of a considerable set of metabolic genes involved in cancer metabolic reprogramming. Consistently, we found that ATRA treatment of NB4 cells drives the activation of aerobic glycolysis pathway and the reduction of OXPHOS-dependent ATP production.

Another nucleoside, 1-(2-azido-2-deoxy-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (cytarazid), is considered a therapeutic drug with antitumor activity in human solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the effects of these nucleosides on cell growth in vitro and in vivo using relevant leukemia cell lines and NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2Rg(null) (NOG) mice, respectively. The nucleosides demonstrated significant cytotoxic effects in ATL and T-ALL cell lines.

We report three patients presented with eosinophilia and FLT3 rearrangement: the first case with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma; the second case with myeloid sarcoma; and the last case with high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome. The first case showed t(13;14)(q12;q32), which encoded FLT3-TRIP11. The patient was treated with intense chemotherapy and subsequently sorafenib with clinical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient showed persistent residual disease and passed away 9 months after the diagnosis from pneumonia. The other two cases both showed ETV6-FLT3. The second patient was treated with local radiation and systemic chemotherapy including sorafenib and was alive. The third patient was treated with chemotherapy but showed transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and died 15 months after diagnosis. These cases are among a growing number of cases with FLT3 rearrangement that all showed similar clinicopathologic features characterized by myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia and frequent T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.

Au@RD NPs of narrow size distribution were characterized by UV-vis and FT-IR spectroscopies, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, particle size analysis, and zeta potential measurements. In vitro stability experiments revealed that the Au@RD NPs were stable for over a year (pH~3.5), proving a significant stabilizing potential of the aqueous RD extract. The high total content of polyphenols, flavonoids, and reducing sugars along with the powerful antioxidant activity of the RD extract was determined by spectroscopic and analytical methods. Colloids prepared from the purified and lyophilized Au@RD NPs (electrokinetic potential of ca. -33mV) were stable for at least 24h under terms similar to physiological conditions (pH=7.4, PBS). The in vitro cytotoxicity of Au@RD NPs was investigated against peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes (PBML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL60), and human lung adenocarcinoma (A549). Selective cytotoxicity of Au@RD NPs towards cancer cells (HL60, A549) over normal cells (PBML) in vitro was explicitly demonstrated by viability assays. Comet assay revealed a higher level of DNA damages in cancer cells when compared with normal ones. Apoptotic death in cancer cells was proved by measuring caspases activity. Thus, the developed Au@RD NPs, obtained by the plant-mediated green synthesis, are attractive hybrid materials for the medical applications combining two active components - metal nanoparticles platform and plant-derived metabolites.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

(Rutaceae) towards a panel of human cancer cells.,113535,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Araliopsis soyauxii Engl. (Rutaceae) is a Cameroonian medicinal plant traditionally used to treat lung diseases, malaria, and gonorrhea. It has been demonstrated that infectious disease contribute to about 20% of all human tumours. AIMS OF THE STUDY: (1) To perform a phytochemical investigation of the dichloromethane-methanol 1:1 extracts of the bark (ASB), roots (ASR), and leaves (ASL) from Araliopsis soyauxii; (2) to evaluate the cytotoxicity of extracts and isolated compounds; (3) to determine the mode of induction of apoptosis of ASB and kihadanin B (12). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen constituents of the crude extracts were isolated by column chromatography, while spectroscopic techniques were used for structural elucidation. The resazurin reduction assay (RRA) was applied to determine the cytotoxicity of samples towards a panel of 9 cancer cell lines. For caspases activity, the Caspase-Glo assay was used; flow cytometry was applied to investigate the cell cycle distribution (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining), and the reactive oxygen species (ROS; H2DCFH-DA staining). RESULTS: Phytochemical investigations of botanicals (ASB, ASR, and ASL) led to the isolation of 14 compounds. Extract ASB, obacunone (11), kihadanin B (12) as well as doxorubicin (control drug) revealed cytotoxicity towards the 9 cancer cell lines tested. The IC50 values ranged from 11.11 mug/mL (against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 28.18 mug/mL (against HCT116 p53(+/+) colon adenocarcinoma cells) for ASB; from 28.25 muM (against MDA-MB-231-pcDNA breast adenocarcinoma cells) to 65.13 muM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for compound 11, and from 5.77 muM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 43.56 muM (against U87.MGDeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells) for compound 12. ASB and compound 12 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells. ASB induced the apoptotic process mediated by MMP alteration and enhanced ROS production, while compound 12 induced apoptosis by caspases activation, MMP alteration, and enhanced ROS production. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that Araliopsis soyauxii is a potential source of cytotoxic phytochemicals such as kihadanin B and that ASB and compound 12.

This process is reliant on precisely timed changes in gene expression controlled by several different hormonal and transcriptional mechanisms. One important transcription factor is SRY-box transcription factor 3 (SOX3), which is transiently expressed within the uncommitted spermatogonial stem cell population. Sox3-null mouse testes exhibit a block in spermatogenesis, leading to infertility or subfertility. However, the molecular role of SOX3 during spermatogonial differentiation remains poorly understood because the genomic regions targeted by this transcription factor have not been identified. In this study we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify and characterise the endogenous genome-wide binding profile of SOX3 in mouse testes at Postnatal Day 7. We show that neurogenin3 (Neurog3 or Ngn3) is directly targeted by SOX3 in spermatogonial stem cells via a novel testes-specific binding site. We also implicate SOX3, for the first time, in direct regulation of histone gene expression and demonstrate that this function is shared by both neural progenitors and testes, and with another important transcription factor required for spermatogenesis, namely promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger (PLZF). Together, these data provide new insights into the function of SOX3 in different stem cell contexts.",,"['McAninch, Dale', 'Thomson, Ella P', 'Thomas, Paul Q']","['McAninch D', 'Thomson EP', 'Thomas PQ']","['School of Biological Sciences and Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; and Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; and Precision Medicine Theme, South Australia Health and Medical Research Institute, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; and Corresponding author.

As AML is dangerous and shows poor prognosis, many researchers categorised the relevant cytogenetic factors according to risk and prognosis. However, the specific reasons for poor cytogenetic factors remain unknown. We analysed a large data set from AML patients and found that TPD52 expression is elevated in patient groups with poor cytogenetic factors. As the amino acid sequence of TPD52 is evolutionally conserved in vertebrates, zebrafish embryos were used to investigate the function of TPD52. Since myeloid-biased haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are relevant to AML, the function of TPD52 in the development of HSCs was investigated. We determined that the zebrafish paralog, tpd52, is important for the maintenance of HSCs through regulation of cell proliferation. As tpd52 is linked to cell proliferation in zebrafish embryos, the proliferation-related gene, CD59, was correlated to TPD52 in every AML cohort with a high correlation coefficient. We suggest that TPD52 can be a novel therapeutic target for AML patients with poor cytogenetic factors.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two patients who possessed HPA-15 alloantibodies (Patient 1, anti-HPA-15b; Patient 2, anti-HPA-15a) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies were enrolled. The efficacy of HPA-15-compatible vs -incompatible platelet transfusion was compared by focusing on ABO- and HLA-matched transfusions on the basis of the 24-hour corrected count increment (CCI-24 hours) for platelets. The titers of HPA-15 antibodies in the patients' sera were also monitored. RESULTS: The patients received 71 and 12 ABO-compatible, HLA-matched platelet transfusions, respectively, during the monitoring periods. Among these transfusions, CCI-24 hours could be calculated in 27 and 10 transfusions, respectively, and the HPA-15 genotype of the donors was determined. There were no significant differences in the CCI-24 hours between the HPA-15 compatible and incompatible transfusions in both patients (P = .30 and .56, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). There was no significant change in the HPA-15b antibody titer in Patient 1 during the monitoring period, while the HPA-15a antibody level in Patient 2 was undetectable at the end of the monitoring period, although the titer was low at the beginning. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of HPA-15-incompatible platelet transfusions was not necessarily inferior to that of HPA-15 compatible ones. Although the case number was limited, our results suggest that HPA-15 antibodies do not have a significant impact on the effects of platelet transfusion.",['(c) 2020 AABB.'],"['Inoue, Hiroko', 'Sakamoto, Rumi', 'Nishimiya, Hiroko', 'Sakamoto, Hiroe', 'Terasu, Shota', 'Aminaka, Ryota', 'Koh, Yangsook', 'Takihara, Yoshihiro', 'Hirayama, Fumiya', 'Kuroishi, Ayumu']","['Inoue H', 'Sakamoto R', 'Nishimiya H', 'Sakamoto H', 'Terasu S', 'Aminaka R', 'Koh Y', 'Takihara Y', 'Hirayama F', 'Kuroishi A']","['Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kinki Block Blood Center, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20201109,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,['NOTNLM'],"['*human platelet antigen-15', '*platelet transfusion', '*refractoriness']",,2020/11/10 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2020/11/09 17:13'],"['2020/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/09 17:13 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2021 Mar;61(3):738-743. doi: 10.1111/trf.16181.

In a multicenter observational study, we recruited 216 patients with hematologic malignancies of any stage from September 2003 to June 2007. Patients were asked about their decisional involvement preferences (Control Preferences Scale), information sources (including most useful source of information), and preferences for their oncologists' presentation of treatment success information. We used multivariate logistic regressions to identify factors associated with decisional involvement preferences and usefulness of information sources (physicians vs nonphysicians). Patient-directed, shared, and physician-directed approaches were preferred in 34%, 38%, and 28% of patients, respectively. Physicians and computer/Internet were the most common information sources; 42% perceived physicians as the most useful source.

The diagnosis of PBL is complex, owing to a frequent solid or cohesive growth pattern, and an often unusual immunophenotype. Several case reports have described cytokeratin (CK) expression in PBL, introducing a diagnostic pitfall. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of CK expression in PBL in the largest series available to date. METHODS AND RESULTS: By using immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 72 PBLs, we identified CK8/18 positivity in 11 of 72 cases (15%) and AE1/3 positivity in six of 65 cases (9%), clearly contrasting with a control series of non-PBL aggressive B-cell lymphomas (one of 96 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas), as well as with data in the literature describing only occasional CK expression in haematological neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate CK expression in a substantial number (15%) of PBLs. In view of the particular morphological features of PBL and its frequent negativity for the common leukocyte antigen and B-cell markers, this feature represents a pitfall in the routine diagnostic work-up of PBL, and requires more extensive immunohistochemical and molecular characterisation of cases entering the differential diagnosis.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Huettl, Katrin S', 'Staiger, Annette M', 'Horn, Heike', 'Frontzek, Fabian', 'Goodlad, John R', 'Tapia, Gustavo', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Fend, Falko', 'Climent, Fina', 'Castellvi, Josep', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Dirnhofer, Stefan', 'Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Navarro, Jose-Tomas', 'Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis', 'Hartmann, Wolfgang', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Ott, German']","['Huettl KS', 'Staiger AM', 'Horn H', 'Frontzek F', 'Goodlad JR', 'Tapia G', 'Rosenwald A', 'Klapper W', 'Fend F', 'Climent F', 'Castellvi J', 'Tzankov A', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Baptista MJ', 'Navarro JT', 'Anagnostopoulos I', 'Hartmann W', 'Lenz G', 'Ott G']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart and University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart and University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medical Department A, Haematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK.', 'Pathology Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Institute of Pathology, Universitat Wurzburg and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Mainfranken (CCCMF), Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Haematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre Tubingen, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany.', ""Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge-IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Pathology, Hospital de Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, ICO-Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, & Berlin Institute of Health; Medical Department of Hematology, Oncology & Tumor Immunology, Virchow Campus & Molekulares Krebsforschungszentrum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Translational Pathology, Gerhard-Domagk-Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Medical Department A, Haematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201225,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,['NOTNLM'],"['cytokeratin', 'immunophenotype', 'leukocyte common antigen', 'lymphoma', 'plasmablastic lymphoma']",,2020/11/10 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2020/11/09 14:29'],"['2020/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/09 14:29 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2021 May;78(6):831-837. doi: 10.1111/his.14300.

Despite some remarkable successes, cell-level evolution remains a potent antagonist to this approach. We suggest that a deeper understanding of the breakdown of cooperation can synergize the evolutionary and druggable-targets approaches. Complexity requires cooperation, whether between cells of different species (symbiosis) or between cells of the same organism (multicellularity). Both forms of cooperation may be associated with nutrient scarcity, which in turn may be associated with a chemiosmotic metabolism. A variety of examples from modern organisms supports these generalities. Indeed, mammalian cancers-unicellular, glycolytic, and fast-replicating-parallel these examples. Nutrient scarcity, chemiosmosis, and associated signaling may favor cooperation, while under conditions of nutrient abundance a fermentative metabolism may signal the breakdown of cooperation. Manipulating this metabolic milieu may potentiate the effects of targeted therapeutics.

The nature of the leukemic stem cell (LSC) has been a subject of continuing discussion, given the fact that human disease is diagnosed at late stages and cannot be monitored during its natural evolution from its cell of origin. Animal models provide a means to determine the leukemic initiating cell and the causes of malignancy, and to develop new treatments. Recent findings in mice have shown that cancer stem cells can initially arise through a reprogramming-like mechanism when the oncogene expression is targeted to the mouse stem cell compartment (Garcia-Ramirez et al., EMBO J 37(14):298783, 2018; Martin-Lorenzo et al., Cancer Res 78 (10):2669-2679, 2018; Perez-Caro et al., EMBO J 28(1):8-20, 2009; Rodriguez-Hernandez et al., Cancer Res 77(16):4365-4377, 2017). If leukemia arises through reprogramming processes, then perhaps many of the oncogenes that initiate tumor formation might be dispensable for tumor progression and maintenance. Leukemia will be modeled in the mice only if we are able to target the right cancer-initiating cell with a precise given oncogene. In the last years, some examples have already started to appear in the literature showing that targeting oncogene expression to the stem cell compartment in model mice might be the correct way of reproducing the genotype-phenotype correlations found in human leukemias (Garcia-Ramirez et al., EMBO J 37(14):298783, 2018; Martin-Lorenzo et al., Cancer Res 78 (10):2669-2679, 2018; Perez-Caro et al., EMBO J 28(1):8-20, 2009; Rodriguez-Hernandez et al., Cancer Res 77(16):4365-4377, 2017).

The cells can then be pooled and injected into mice for competitive readout of leukemia-initiating activity.

Cellular barcodes are (semi-)random synthetic DNA sequences of a fixed length, which are used to uniquely mark and track cells over time. A successful barcoding experiment consists of several essential steps, including library production, transfection, transduction, barcode retrieval, and barcode data analysis. Key challenges are to obtain sufficient number of barcoded cells to conduct experiments and reliable barcode data analysis. This is especially relevant for experiments using primary leukemia cells (which are of limited availability and difficult to transduce), when studying low levels of chimerism, or when the barcoded cell population is sorted in different smaller subpopulations (e.g., lineage contribution of normal hematopoietic stem cells in murine xenografts). In these settings, retrieving accurate barcode data from low input material using standard PCR amplification techniques might be challenging and more sophisticated approaches are required.

The inherent functional and genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity in AML is thought to play an important role in disease recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models preserve important features of the original tumor, allowing, at the same time, experimental manipulation and in vivo amplification of the human cells. Here we present a detailed protocol for the generation of fluorescently labeled AML PDX models to monitor cell proliferation kinetics in vivo, at the single-cell level. Although experimental protocols for cell proliferation studies are well established and widespread, they are not easily applicable to in vivo contexts, and the analysis of related time-series data is often complex to achieve. To overcome these limitations, model-driven approaches can be exploited to investigate different aspects of cell population dynamics. Among the existing approaches, the ProCell framework is able to perform detailed and accurate stochastic simulations of cell proliferation, relying on flow cytometry data. In particular, by providing an initial and a target fluorescence histogram, ProCell automatically assesses the validity of any user-defined scenario of intra-tumor heterogeneity, that is, it is able to infer the proportion of various cell subpopulations (including quiescent cells) and the division interval of proliferating cells. Here we explain the protocol in detail, providing a description of our methodology for the conditional expression of H2B-GFP in human AML xenografts, data processing by flow cytometry, and the final elaboration in ProCell.",,"['Vlachou, Thalia', 'Nobile, Marco S', 'Ronchini, Chiara', 'Besozzi, Daniela', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Vlachou T', 'Nobile MS', 'Ronchini C', 'Besozzi D', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Milan, Italy. thalia.vlachou@ieo.it.', 'Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. m.s.nobile@tue.nl.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Cell proliferation', '*Computational intelligence', '*Global optimization', '*Human xenografts', '*Mathematical modeling', '*Parameter estimation', '*Stochastic simulation']",,2020/11/10 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/11/09 14:27'],"['2020/11/09 14:27 [entrez]', '2020/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2021;2185:241-258. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0810-4_14.,20210323,10.1007/978-1-0716-0810-4_14 [doi],,IM,"['Animals', '*Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism/pathology']",['10.1007/978-1-0716-0810-4_14 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the availability of experimental animal models capable of recapitulating the biology of human T-ALL is obligatory as a critical tool to explore novel promising therapies directed against specific targets that have been previously validated in in vitro assays.

Compared with conventional therapies, TTs are delivered over a longer period and often have unusual symptom profiles. Patient-reported outcome measures such as symptom side-effect lists need to be developed in a time-efficient manner to enable a rapid and full evaluation of new treatments and effective clinical management OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a set of TT-related symptoms and identify the optimal method for developing symptom lists. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Symptoms from TT treatment in the context of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), HER2-positive breast cancer, or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours (GIST) were identified through literature reviews, interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients, and patient focus groups. The symptom set was then pilot tested in patients across the three cancer diagnoses: The number of items derived from each source (literature, patients, or HCPs) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients and 86 HCPs from 16 countries participated. An initial set of 209 symptoms was reduced to 61 covering 12 symptom categories. Patient interviews made the greatest contribution to the item set. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom lists should be created based on input from patients.

We evaluated the burden of tuberculosis in children with cancer. METHODS: Children with cancer were enrolled and screened for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using the tuberculin skin test and enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (T-SPOT.TB; Oxford Immunotec Ltd, Oxford, United Kingdom). Children with physician-suspected tuberculosis were investigated for M. tuberculosis using microscopy and culture on sputum or gastric washings. RESULTS: We enrolled 169 children; 10.7% were living with HIV. The tuberculin skin test was positive in 2.9% of patients, who were treated for tuberculosis and excluded from further analysis. The enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (T-SPOT.TB) was either negative or indeterminate in the first 100 children screened. The incidence of tuberculosis was 7.6 per 100 child-years; 35.3% were culture-confirmed. Tuberculosis was diagnosed at a mean of 5.5 months from cancer diagnosis. A greater proportion of children living with HIV (44.4%) developed tuberculosis than those without (17.2%; adjusted P = 0.042). Children treated for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, advanced stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia (P = 0.009) and those with a higher exposure-period (per 100 child-years) to corticosteroids courses (350 vs. 29.4; P < 0.001) had a higher incidence of tuberculosis. Twenty-six of 34 children (76.5%) with tuberculosis died; multiple infections were identified at the time of death. CONCLUSIONS: Screening children for tuberculosis infection at cancer diagnosis was of limited value. The high rate of tuberculosis and poor outcomes emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion to diagnose tuberculosis and consideration for antituberculosis treatment, especially for those with identified risk factors.",,"['Naidu, Gita', 'Izu, Alane', 'Madimabe, Metsekae Richard', 'Poyiadjis, Stelios', 'MacKinnon, Diane', 'Rowe, Biance', 'Madhi, Shabir Ahmed']","['Naidu G', 'Izu A', 'Madimabe MR', 'Poyiadjis S', 'MacKinnon D', 'Rowe B', 'Madhi SA']","['Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit.', 'Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit.', 'Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit.', 'Paediatric Oncology Unit, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Paediatric Oncology Unit, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Paediatric Oncology Unit, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,,,,2020/11/10 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2020/11/09 14:24'],"['2020/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/09 14:24 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2020 Dec;39(12):1111-1115. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000002873.,20210726,10.1097/INF.0000000000002873 [doi],,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', '*Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'South Africa', '*Tuberculosis/complications/epidemiology']","['10.1097/INF.0000000000002873 [doi]', '00006454-202012000-00019 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three ALL subtypes had lower MTXPG levels (T cell ALL [T-ALL] and B cell ALL [B-ALL] with the TCF3-PBX1 or ETV6-RUNX1 fusions), and 2 subtypes had higher MTXPG levels (hyperdiploid and BCR-ABL like). The folate pathway genes SLC19A1, ABCC1, ABCC4, FPGS, and MTHFD1 significantly influenced intracellular MTXPG levels (P = 2.9 x 10-3 to 3.7 x 10-8). A multivariable model including the ALL subtype (P = 1.1 x 10-14), the SLC19A1/(ABCC1 + ABCC4) transporter ratio (P = 3.6 x 10-4), the MTX infusion time (P = 1.5 x 10-3), FPGS mRNA expression (P = 2.1 x 10-3), and MTX systemic clearance (P = 4.4 x 10-2) explained 42% of the variation in MTXPG accumulation (P = 1.1 x 10-38). Model simulations indicated that a longer infusion time (24 h vs. 4 h) was superior in achieving higher intracellular MTXPG levels across all subtypes if ALL.CONCLUSIONSThese findings provide insights

We established a new MDS/AML cell line, YCU-AML1, and its patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model from a high-risk MDS patient who later transformed into AML harboring both t(3;3)(q21;q26.2) and monosomy 7. YCU-AML1 cells propagated in co-culture system with stromal cells in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent manner. CD34(+) bone marrow cells derived from our PDX model showed high EVI1 and low GATA2 expression. Moreover, mutational profile of our MDS/AML model was consistent with recently published mutational spectrum of myeloid malignancies with inv(3)/t(3;3).

The differentiation process by which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) acquire specific functions has been extensively investigated and is considered the paradigm of cell differentiation. It has been widely accepted that highly enriched HSCs are heterogeneous with respect to their lymphopoietic potential, and aged or stressed HSCs are skewed to the myeloid lineage. Several transcription factors and cytokine signaling pathways have been reported as essential to lymphocyte differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism that modulates the earliest stage remains unclear. Furthermore, the origin and characteristics of early T-lymphoid progenitors that migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus are still unknown in this field. Epigenetic mechanisms likely influence early lineage specification through the regulation of mitochondrial function and modification of nuclear chromatin structure.

Nowadays, more client proteins and more inhibitors of Hsp90 are being discovered. Chaetocin has been identified as an inhibitor of histone methyl transferase SUV39H1. Herein, we find that Chaetocin is an inhibitor of Hsp90 which binds to the C-terminal of Hsp90alpha. Chaetocin inhibited a variety of Hsp90 client proteins including AMl1-ETO and BCL-ABL, the mutant fusion-protein in the K562 and HL-60 cells. SUV39H1 mediates epigenetic events in the pathophysiology of hematopoietic disorders. We found that inhibition of Hsp90 by Chaetocin and 17-AAG had ability to induce degradation of SUV39H1 through proteasome pathway. In addition, SUV39H1 interacted with Hsp90 through co-chaperone HOP. These results suggest that SUV39H1 belongs to a client protein of Hsp90. Moreover, Chaetocin was able to induce cell differentiation in the two cells in the concentration range of Hsp90 inhibition. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SUV39H1 is a new client protein of Hsp90 degradated by Chaetocin as a novel C-terminal inhibitor of Hsp90. The study establishes a new relationship of Chaetocin and SUV39H1, and paves an avenue for exploring a new strategy to target SUV39H1 by inhibition of Hsp90 in leukemia.",,"['Lian, Bin', 'Lin, Qian', 'Tang, Wei', 'Qi, Xin', 'Li, Jing']","['Lian B', 'Lin Q', 'Tang W', 'Qi X', 'Li J']","['Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts of Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, China.', 'Open Studio for Drugability Research of Marine Natural Products, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Biomol Ther (Seoul),Biomolecules & therapeutics,101472832,PMC7771846,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Chaetocin', 'Client protein', 'Hsp90', 'SUV39H1']",,2020/11/10 06:00,2020/11/10 06:01,['2020/11/09 05:28'],"['2020/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/10 06:01 [medline]', '2020/11/09 05:28 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2021 Jan 1;29(1):73-82. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2020.012.,,10.4062/biomolther.2020.012 [doi],,,,"['biomolther.2020.012 [pii]', '10.4062/biomolther.2020.012 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emergence of immunoregulatory cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T regulatory (Treg) cells, has been considered one potential mechanism of relapse in children with ALL. AIM: This study aimed to address the microRNAs (miRNAs) related to MDSCs and Treg cells and to explore their targeted immunoregulatory pathways. METHODS: Affymetrix microarray was used for global miRNA profiling in B-ALL pediatric patients before, during, and after induction of chemotherapy. Bioinformatics analysis was performed on MDSCs and Treg cells-related dysregulated miRNAs, and miR-Pathway analysis was performed to explore their targeted immunoregulatory pathways. RESULTS: 516 miRNAs were dysregulated in ALL patients as compared to the healthy donor. Among them, 13 miRNAs and 8 miRNAs related to MDSCs and Treg cells, respectively, were common in all patients. Besides, 12 miRNAs were shared between MDSCs and Treg cells; 4 of them were common in all patients. Four immune-related pathways; TNF, TGF-beta, FoxO, and Hippo were found implicated. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study concluded certain miRNAs related to MDSCs and Treg cells, these miRNAs were linked to immunoregulatory pathways. Our results open avenues for testing those miRNA as molecular biomarkers for the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Until now, only a limited number of cases regarding children with M-HLH has been reported. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 27 children with M-HLH, who admitted to our center between July 2007 and October 2019. The clinical data and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The median age of the children with M-HLH was 7 years. Underlying diseases included myeloid malignancy (n = 6), lymphoid malignancy (n = 18) and unknown type lymphoma (n = 3). The one-year mortality rate was 56%. All patients had persistent fever. The clinical manifestations included hepatomegaly (89%), splenomegaly (67%) and central nervous system symptoms (56%). Thirteen children (48%) had Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. No significant differences were observed between EBV-positive and negative M-HLH patients in terms of most clinical indicators. However, EBV-positive M-HLH patients showed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and more hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow (BM) in contrast to EBV-negative patients. Eighteen patients (67%) received the HLH-94/04 regimen as the initial treatment. There were no significant differences in the overall survival (OS) between EBV-positive and negative patients.

With the exception of BCR-ABL positive and KMT2A rearranged MPAL, the biology of the majority of MPAL remains uncertain. Several recent studies have explored the genomic and epigenetic landscape of MPAL and have suggested a further refinement of the WHO classification to emphasize the genomic heterogeneity of MPAL. Further studies including single cell analysis, whole exome sequencing and time of flight cytometry will provide for further biological characterization. Treatment decisions are complicated due to this lack of classification and the dearth of prospective randomized studies. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type therapy appears to achieve higher remission rates, and allogenic stem cell transplantation may be beneficial in a select group of patients in first complete remission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis quantified cancer drug approvals across the 15 tumor types with the highest incidence. Number of approvals in a given time period for each tumor was translated into a treatment stock measure, defined as a weighted sum of new indication approvals since 1976. The primary outcome was the annual tumor-specific cancer mortality, defined as the number of deaths per 100,000 U.S. population. The analysis used a multivariable ordinary least squares and a fixed effects model, controlling for incidence (new cases per 100,000 U.S. population) and the primary exposure, the treatment stock measure by year. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2016, deaths per 100,000 population across the 15 most common tumor types declined by 24%. Additionally, 10.2 new indications were approved per year across the 15 most common tumor types. Cancer drug approvals were associated with statistically significant deaths averted in 2016 for colorectal cancer (4,991, p = 0.004), lung cancer (33,825, p < 0.001), breast cancer (11,502, p < 0.001), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (6,636, p < 0.001), leukemia (4,011, p < 0.001), melanoma (1,714, p < 0.001), gastric cancer (758, p = 0.019), and renal cancer (739, p < 0.001). Between 2000 and 2016, new cancer treatments were correlated with 1,291,769 (p < 0.001) total deaths prevented across the 15 most common tumor types. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cancer drug approvals between 2000 and 2016 were associated with significant reduction in deaths from the most common cancers in the USA. Mortality changes were largest in prevalent tumor types with relatively more approvals, i.e. lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, lymphoma and leukemia.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-TNF inhibitors in anti-HTLV-1 antibody-positive patients with RA. METHODS: We reviewed patients with RA who received abatacept or tocilizumab as the first biologic agent. We used the data of patients treated with TNF inhibitors from our previous study to compare the effectiveness between the anti-HTLV-1 antibody-positive patients treated with TNF inhibitors and non-TNF inhibitors using the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) method. RESULTS: A total of 359 patients were divided into anti-HTLV-1 antibody-negative and -positive patients of 332 and 27, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in the change in the clinical disease activity index between the anti-HTLV-1 antibody-positive and -negative patients. The results using the IPTW method showed a significant association between the non-TNF inhibitors treatment and a better response. None of the patients developed adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis during the 24 weeks.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the backbone of therapy especially among younger patients; however the effective incorporation of targeted therapies continues to be an area of active research in an effort to improve response durations and survival. Cell cycle inhibitors (CCI) are a novel class of agents which may be of particular interest for development in patients with AML. Areas covered: We will review the concept of CCIs along with available pre-clinical and clinical data in the treatment of AML both in North America and abroad. Specific drug targets reviewed include cyclin D kinase, Aurora kinase, CHK1, and WEE1. Expert opinion: Utilization of CCIs in patients with AML is an emerging approach that has shown promise in pre-clinical models. It has been challenging to translate this concept into clinical success thus far, due to marginal single-agent activity and significant toxicity profiles, however clinical evaluation is ongoing. Addition of these agents to cytotoxic chemotherapy and other targeted therapies provides a potential combinatorial path forward for this novel class of therapies. Developing optimal combinations while balancing toxicity are among the top clinical challenges that must be overcome before we can anticipate adoption of these agents into the armamentarium of AML therapy.",,"['Jammal, Nadya', 'Rausch, Caitlin R', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['Jammal N', 'Rausch CR', 'Kadia TM', 'Pemmaraju N']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201119,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CDK', '*CHK1', '*WEE1', '*aurora kinase', '*cell cycle inhibitors']",,2020/11/10 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/11/09 05:21'],"['2020/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/09 05:21 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2020 Dec;25(4):491-499. doi: 10.1080/14728214.2020.1847272.

Twenty-six deaths from indirect causes related to a pre-existing pathology, excluding disease of the circulatory system or infection, were analysed by the committee of experts. Pre-existing pathology during pregnancy was documented in 13 women (asthma, n=3, genetic diseases, n=3, previous breast cancer, n=2, major sickle cell syndrome, n=2, epilepsy, n=1 and brain tumour, n=1). In 13 women, the pathology was not known before pregnancy (breast cancer, n=6, brain tumours, n=3, uterine sarcoma, n=1, cervical cancer, n=1, malignant melanoma, n=1 and acute myeloid leukaemia, n=1). For 16 women (61%), the death is related to a neoplastic pathology. Although the majority were considered inevitable for 11/16 women, 5 deaths were considered possibly preventable, the main preventable factor being a delay in diagnosis, and/or a delay in starting a specific treatment. For 10 women, the death is related to a chronic non-neoplastic pathology, known before pregnancy for 9 women, judged most often as possibly preventable, the main preventable factor being the failure of the medical team or the patient to take the pathology and/or its treatment into account.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of WT1 gene was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood according to the European Leukemia Net recommendations. Between May 2005 and August 2019, we analyzed 147 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia with high WT1 expression at diagnosis, transplanted in first (CR1) or second (CR2) complete remission. RESULTS: At the time of allo-HSCT, 107 patients had WT1-normal expression (WT1 </= 50 copies), and 40 patients had WT1-high expression. The median follow-up was 21 months. The estimated 5-year overall survival and event-free survival was significantly better in the WT1-normal cohort (65% and 57% vs. 37% and 25%; P = .0003 and P < .0001, respectively) and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in the WT1-normal group (19% vs. 53%; P < .0001). Five-year non-relapse mortality was not significantly different (20% and 23%). Multivariate analysis revealed WT1-high expression and acute graft-versus-host disease grade 3/4 as significantly negative prognostic factors for OS. Overall, 49 patients developed WT1 molecular relapse in the post-transplant period; in 14 cases, the therapeutic intervention was done. In all but 1 relapsed patient where WT1 minimal residual disease (MRD) was monitored (38 patients), we detected WT1-high levels (sensitivity of 97%). CONCLUSION: The results of the analysis confirmed our previous experience that WT1 status before allo-HSCT is a strong prognostic factor for both OS and relapse risk. In addition, we confirmed the usefulness of this marker for MRD monitoring after allo-HSCT.

The present study attempts to investigate the roles of miR-146a-5p in regulating cytokine expression in a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Four types of PM2.5 extracts obtained from Beijing, China, were subjected to cytotoxic tests in THP-1 cells. These four PM2.5 extracts included two water extracts collected from non-heating and heating season (WN and WH), and two organic extracts from non-heating and heating season (DN and DH). Firstly, the four PM2.5 extracts caused cytotoxicity, oxidative stress responses, cytokine gene expressions and interleukin 8 (IL-8) release in THP-1 cells, with WH showing the highest cytotoxicity, WN showing the highest oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Additionally, we observed expression of miR-146a-5p was significantly increased, with the maximal response of six folds in WN group. Cellular autophagy was initiated by PM2.5 indicated by related protein and gene expressions. Both RNA interference and autophagy inhibitor were applied to interrupt autophagy process in THP-1 cells. Autophagy dysfunction could alleviate IL-8 expression, suggesting autophagy process regulated cytokine expression and inflammatory response caused by PM2.5. A chemical inhibitor was applied to inhibit the function of miR-146a-5p, and then the expressions of IL-8 and autophagic genes were significantly aggravated. Meanwhile, two target genes of miR-146a-5p, interleukin-1 associated-kinase-1 (IRAK1) and tumor-necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) were increased dramatically, which also played important roles in regulation of autophagy. These data suggested miR-146a-5p negatively modulated cytokine expression caused by PM2.5 via autophagy process through the target genes of IRAK1 and TRAF6. Our findings raised the concerns of the changes of miR expression profile and following responses caused by PM2.5.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data of a treatment plan for 8 acute leukemia patients (height range: 109-130 cm) were analyzed. All patients underwent total-body computed tomography (CT) with 5-mm slice thickness. A lead wire, placed at 10 cm above the patella, was used to mark the boundary between the two segments. Target volumes and organs at risk were delineated using a Varian Eclipse 10.0 physician's workstation. Different distances between the lead wire and the boundary of the two targets were used. CT images were transferred to the HT workstation to design the treatment plans, by adjusting parameters, including the field width (FW; 2.5 cm, and 5 cm), pitch (0.287 and 0.430), modulation factor (1.8). The plans were superimposed to analyze the dose distributions in the overlap region when varying target gap distances, FWs, pitches to determine the optimal combinations. RESULTS: The pitch did not affect the dose distribution in the overlap region. The dose distribution in the overlap region was mostly homogeneous when the target gap distance was equal to the FW. Increased FW diminished the effect of the target gap distance on the heterogeneous index of the overlap region.

However, updated trends remain largely unknown in the region. Given that leukemia is the leading cause of cancer-related death in LAC children, we evaluated mortality trends in children (0-14y) from 15 LAC countries for the period 2000-2017 and predicted mortality to 2030. METHODS: We retrieved cancer mortality data using the World Health Organization Mortality Database. Mortality rates (standardized to the world standard SEGI population) were analyzed for 15 LAC countries. We evaluated the average mortality rates for the last 5 years (2013-2017). Joinpoint regression analysis was used to evaluate leukemia mortality trends and provide an estimated annual percent change (EAPC). Nordpred was utilized for the calculation of predictions until 2030. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2017, the highest mortality rates were reported in Venezuela, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Peru. Upward mortality trends were reported in Nicaragua (EAPC by 2.9% in boys, and EAPC by 2.0% in girls), and Peru (EAPC by 1.4% in both sexes). Puerto Rico experienced large declines in mortality among both boys (EAPC by - 9.7%), and girls (EAPC by - 6.0%). Leukemia mortality will increase in Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay by 2030. CONCLUSION: Leukemia mortality is predicted to increase in some LAC countries by 2030.

An epidemiological association exists between the individual risk of BOT and family history of BOT and certain other cancers (pancreatic, lung, bone, leukemia) (LE3), a personal history of benign ovarian cyst (LE2), a personal history of tubo-ovarian infection (LE3), the use of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LE3), oral contraceptive use (LE3), multiparity (LE3), Hormonal replacement therapy (LE3), high consumption of Coumestrol (LE4), medical treatment for infertility with progesterone (LE3) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (LE3). Screening for BOTs is not recommended for patients (Grade C). The overall risk of recurrence of BOTs varies between 2% and 24 %, with an overall survival greater than 94 % at 10 years, and the risk of an invasive recurrence of a BOT ranges from 0.5 % to 3.8 %. The use of scores and nomograms can be useful in assessing the risk of recurrence, and providing patients with information (Grade C). The WHO classification is recommended for classifying BOTs. It is recommended that the presence of a microinvasive focus (<5 mm) and microinvasive carcinoma (<5 mm with an atypical nuclei and a desmoplastic stroma reaction) within a BOT be reported. In cases of serous BOT, it is recommended to specify the classic histological subtype or micropapillary / cribriform type (Grade C). When confronted with a BOT, it is recommended that the invasive or non-invasive nature of peritoneal implants can be investigated based solely on the invasion and destruction of underlying adipose or peritoneal tissue which has a desmoplastic stromal reaction where in contact with the invasive clusters (Grade B). For bilateral mucinous BOTs and / or in cases with peritoneal implants or peritoneal pseudomyxoma, it is recommended to also look for a primitive digestive or pancreato-biliary cancer (Grade C). It is recommended to sample ovarian tumors suspected of being BOTs by focusing samples on vegetations and solid components, with at least 1 sample per cm in tumors with a size less than 10 cm and 2 samples per cm in tumors with a size greater than 10 cm (Grade C). In cases of BOTs and in the absence of macroscopic omental involvement after careful macroscopic examination, it is recommended to perform at least 4-6 systematic sampling blocks and to include all peritoneal implants (Grade C). It is recommended to consult an expert pathologist in gynecology when a BOT suspicion requires intraoperative extemporaneous histology (grade C). Endo-vaginal and suprapubic ultrasonography are recommended for the analysis of an ovarian mass (Grade A). In case of an undetermined ovarian lesion on ultrasonography, it is recommended that a pelvic MRI be performed (Grade A). To analyze an adnexal mass with MRI, it is recommended to use an MRI protocol with T2, T1, T1 Fat Sat, dynamic and diffusion sequences as well as gadolinium injection (Grade B). To characterize an adnexal mass with MRI, it is recommended to include a score system for malignancy (ADNEX MR/O-RADS) (Grade C) in the report and to formulate a histological hypothesis (Grade C). Pelvic MRI is recommended to characterize a tumor suspected of being a BOT (Grade C). Macroscopic MRI features should be analyzed to differentiate BOT subtypes (Grade C). Pelvic ultrasound is the first-line examination for the detection and characterization of adnexal masses during pregnancy (Grade C). Pelvic MRI is recommended from 12 weeks of gestation in case of an indeterminate adnexal mass and should provide a diagnostic score (Grade C). Gadolinium injection must be minimized as fetal impairment has been proven (Grade C). It is recommended that serum levels of HE4 and CA125 be evaluated and that the ROMA score for the diagnosis of an indeterminate ovarian mass on imaging be used (grade A). In case of suspicion of a mucinous BOT on imaging, dosage of serum levels of CA 19-9 can be considered (Grade C). If the determination of tumor markers is normal preoperatively, routine dosage of tumor markers in BOT follow-up is not recommended (Grade C). In case of preoperative elevation in tumor markers, the determination of serum CA 125 levels is recommended in the follow-up of BOT (Grade B). When conservative treatment of a BOT has been adopted, the use of endovaginal and transabdominal ultrasonography is recommended during follow-up (Grade B).",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is clinically used to treat diverse cancers, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in China. However, paradoxic roles of realgar to increase or decrease immunity are reported. It is urgent to address this question, due to immune depression can be strongly benefit to cancer development, but detrimental to patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: This present work is to explore whether realgar promote or suppress immune responses, and shed light on its mode of action. Our results should provide cues for rational strategy to explore realgar for clinical use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Infection model in vivo was established by using Enterococcus faecalis to attack Caenorhabditis elegans, then realgar was used to treat the infected worms to investigate its effects on infectivity and the underlying mechanism. Killing analysis was carried out to test whether realgar can mitigate worm infection. Thermotolerance resistance analysis was used to evaluate if realgar functions hormetic effect. Quantification of live E. faecalis in nematode intestine was employed to ascertain if realgar alleviate the bacterial load in worm gut. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression of antibacterial effectors. Western blot was used to test the effect of realgar on the expressions of p38 and phospho-p38 in worms infected by E. faecalis. RESULTS: Realgar alleviated the infected worms in strains of N2, glp-4, and daf-2, but failed in sek-1, glp-4; sek-1, and daf-2; daf-16 when p38 MAPK or daf-16 was blocked or inactivated. Western blot assay demonstrated that realgar increased the expression of phosph-p38. Thermotolerance assay showed that realgar played a hormetic role on nemtodes, triggered protective response and reduced bacterial load after realgar treatment for 120 h qRT-PCR demonstrated that realgar significantly increased antibacterial effectors, thus leading to pathogen elimination. CONCLUSION: Realgar increased defenses against E. faecalis in C. elegans by inducing both immune responses and protective responses. It was regulated by p38 MAPK pathway and DAF-16.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-established dataset was used in this study that was exempted from review by the institution review board, which consisted of 13,504 bone marrow smear images. One subset of the dataset with 12,215 labeled images was split into training (80%) and validation (20%), another with 1289 labeled images was used to test, in which each test entry consists of about 130 images. An instance segmentation method named Mask R-CNN was used to detect and classify the nucleated cells. Here, we train a trained neural network from scratch; for comparison, we also use a network pre-trained on MS COCO (common objects in context, a data set provided by Microsoft which can be used for image recognition, the images in MS coco dataset are divided into training, validation and test sets) and fine-tuned with our dataset and both were trained with same data augmentation scheme. Diagnosis systems based on trained models and ""FAB Classification"" (French-American-British classification systems, a series of diagnostic criteria for acute leukemia, which was first proposed in 1976) were developed for diagnosing the test entry as APL or as not. Average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) were used to evaluate model performance. RESULTS: The best-performing model had an average precision of 62.5%, which was the augmented pre-trained Mask R-CNN with average recall 84.1%. The average precision of the pre-trained model was greater than that of the model trained from scratch (P < 0.05). Augmenting the dataset further increased accuracy (P < 0 0.03). CONCLUSION: Deep learning technology such as instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN may accurately diagnose APL in bone marrow smear images with an average precision of 62.5% when 0.5 as IoU thresholds.

It is generally regarded as a safe procedure with low rate of major complications. Inadvertent vascular injury is however an uncommon but important complication of bone marrow biopsy procedure. The knowledge of a safe and effective embolization method is crucial for interventional radiologists to reduce significant patient morbidity and mortality, shall such inadvertent vascular injury occurs. CASE PRESENTATION: Bedside bone marrow biopsy was performed for an elderly gentleman to evaluate for his underlying acute leukaemia. Biopsy needle inadvertently injured the internal iliac artery and vein during the procedure. Coil embolization was carefully performed across injured arterial segment via the culprit biopsy needle until contrast cessation. Concomitant venous injury was subsequently confirmed on angiography when the needle was withdrawn for a short distance from the iliac artery. This venous injury was tackled by further withdrawing the biopsy needle to distal end of the bone marrow tract for tract embolization with coils and gelatin sponges. High caution was made to avoid coil dislodgement into the iliac vein, to prevent pulmonary embolism. Patient was clinically stable throughout the procedure. Post-procedure contrast CT shows no pelvic haematoma or contrast extravasation. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates rescue embolization techniques for rare life-threatening concomitant internal iliac arterial and venous injuries by a bone marrow biopsy needle. Interventional radiologists can play an important role in carrying out precise embolization to avoid significant patient morbidity and mortality in the case of life-threatening haemorrhage.",,"['Tsai, Chris Siu-Chun', 'Yu, Simon Chun-Ho']","['Tsai CS', 'Yu SC']","['Department of Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR.', 'Department of Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR. simonyu@cuhk.edu.hk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201107,Switzerland,CVIR Endovasc,CVIR endovascular,101738484,PMC7648822,['NOTNLM'],"['Embolotherapy', 'Therapeutic embolization', 'Vascular injury']",,2020/11/08 06:00,2020/11/08 06:01,['2020/11/07 12:06'],"['2020/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/07 12:06 [entrez]', '2020/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/08 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,CVIR Endovasc. 2020 Nov 7;3(1):80. doi: 10.1186/s42155-020-00172-9.,,10.1186/s42155-020-00172-9 [doi],,,,"['10.1186/s42155-020-00172-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s42155-020-00172-9 [pii]']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8715-5026'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present an analysis of cancer patients from the LEOSS (Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients) registry to determine whether cancer patients are at higher risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 435 cancer patients and 2636 non-cancer patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled between March 16 and August 31, 2020. Data on socio-demographics, comorbidities, cancer-related features and infection course were collected. Age-, sex- and comorbidity-adjusted analysis was performed. Primary endpoint was COVID-19-related mortality. RESULTS: In total, 435 cancer patients were included in our analysis. Commonest age category was 76-85 years (36.5%), and 40.5% were female. Solid tumors were seen in 59% and lymphoma and leukemia in 17.5% and 11% of patients. Of these, 54% had an active malignancy, and 22% had recently received anti-cancer treatments. At detection of SARS-CoV-2, the majority (62.5%) presented with mild symptoms. Progression to severe COVID-19 was seen in 55% and ICU admission in 27.5%. COVID-19-related mortality rate was 22.5%. Male sex, advanced age, and active malignancy were associated with higher death rates. Comparing cancer and non-cancer patients, age distribution and comorbidity differed significantly, as did mortality (14% vs 22.5%, p value < 0.001). After adjustments for other risk factors, mortality was comparable. CONCLUSION: Comparing cancer and non-cancer patients, outcome of COVID-19 was comparable after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidity. However, our results emphasize that cancer patients as a group are at higher risk due to advanced age and pre-existing conditions.",,"['Ruthrich, Maria Madeleine', 'Giessen-Jung, C', 'Borgmann, S', 'Classen, A Y', 'Dolff, S', 'Gruner, B', 'Hanses, F', 'Isberner, N', 'Kohler, P', 'Lanznaster, J', 'Merle, U', 'Nadalin, S', 'Piepel, C', 'Schneider, J', 'Schons, M', 'Strauss, R', 'Tometten, L', 'Vehreschild, J J', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, M', 'Beutel, G', 'Wille, K']","['Ruthrich MM', 'Giessen-Jung C', 'Borgmann S', 'Classen AY', 'Dolff S', 'Gruner B', 'Hanses F', 'Isberner N', 'Kohler P', 'Lanznaster J', 'Merle U', 'Nadalin S', 'Piepel C', 'Schneider J', 'Schons M', 'Strauss R', 'Tometten L', 'Vehreschild JJ', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Beutel G', 'Wille K']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany. maria.ruethrich@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans-Knoll Institute, Jena, Germany. maria.ruethrich@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, Ingolstadt Hospital, Ingolstadt, Germany.', 'Department I for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Section Clinical Infectiology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Emergency Department, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Passau Hospital, Passau, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral and Transplant Surgery, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Hospital Bremen-Center, Bremen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Munich, Germany.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Infectiology, Hospital Ernst-von-Bergmann, Potsdam, Germany.', 'Department I for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans-Knoll Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'University of Bochum, University Clinic for Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Palliative Care, Minden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20201107,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,PMC7648543,['NOTNLM'],"['Adjusted analysis', 'COVID-19', 'Cancer patients', 'Cohort study', 'LEOSS', 'Pandemic', 'SARS-CoV-2']",,2020/11/08 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/11/07 12:06'],"['2020/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/07 12:06 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Feb;100(2):383-393. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04328-4.

However, it is currently unknown whether adherence to guideline recommendations translates into improved survival. The sizeable database of the Duesseldorf MDS Registry allowed us to address this question. We first performed a retrospective analysis including 1698 patients (cohort 1) to whom we retrospectively applied the ELN guidelines. We compared patients treated according to the guidelines with patients who deviated from it, either because they received a certain treatment though it was not recommended or because they did not receive that treatment despite being eligible. We also performed a prospective study with 381 patients (cohort 2) who were seen in our department and received guideline-based expert advice. Again, we compared the impact of subsequent guideline-adherent versus non-adherent treatment. For the majority of treatment options (best supportive care, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, low-dose chemotherapy, and intensive chemotherapy), we found that adherence to the ELN guidelines did not improve survival in cohort 1. The same was true when patient management was prospectively enhanced through guideline-based treatment advice given by MDS experts (cohort 2). The only exceptions were alloSCT and iron chelation (ICT). Patients receiving ICT and alloSCT as recommended fared significantly better than those who were eligible but received other treatment. Our analysis underscores the limited survival impact of most MDS therapies and suggests to pursue alloSCT in all suitable candidates.

METHODS: This phase 2, single-center study (NCT03820908) enrolled adult R/R AML to receive bisantrene (250 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days) which was administered via an intravenous infusion over 2 hours on days 1-7. Disease assessment included routine blood work and bone marrow studies. RESULTS: In all, 10 patients were enrolled with a median of 3 lines of prior therapy including seven patients who had relapsed following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The most frequently reported grade >/=3 treatment-attributed hematologic AE was thrombocytopenia, whereas the most frequently reported grade >/=3 treatment-attributed non-hematologic AE was mucositis. Of the 10 patients, one (10%) achieved a complete remission and three patients achieved a partial remission resulting in an overall response rate of 40%.

This disease not only affects adult but also is a common cancer type among children. Treatment of leukaemia depends on its type and how far the disease has spread in the body. Leukaemia is classified into two types depending on how rapidly it grows: acute and chronic leukaemia. The early diagnosis of this disease is vital for effective treatment and recovery. This paper presents an automated diagnostic system to detect acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model uses labeled microscopic blood smear images to detect the malignant leukaemia cells. The current work uses data obtained from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Image DataBase (ALL_IDB) and performs various data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data which in effect reduces the over-training problem. The model has been trained on 515 images using a fivefold validation technique achieving an accuracy of 95.54% and further tested on the remaining 221 images achieving almost 100% accuracy during most of the trials, maintaining an average of 99.5% accuracy. The method does not need any pre-processing or segmentation technique and works efficiently on raw data. This method can, hence, prove profitable for pathologist in diagnosing ALL efficiently.

This renders decision-making complex and imminent. Unfortunately, many patients with AML misestimate their prognosis and treatment risk. While decision aids can improve illness understanding and reduce decisional conflict, there are no validated decision aids for AML. We developed and tested a novel AML decision aid (NCT03442452). METHODS: Patients (n = 20) were recruited at Duke University from May 2018 to February 2019. Participants completed assessments of AML knowledge and decisional conflict, before and after using the electronic decision aid. The primary endpoint was feasibility (endpoint met if > 80% of study participants completed all study components). Secondary analyses of efficacy were conducted using paired t tests for dependent pre-/post-samples. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of feasibility was met (100% of participants completed all study components). Secondary analyses showed improved knowledge and reduced decisional conflict after using the decision aid. Knowledge scores improved from a mean of 11.8 (out of 18) correct items at baseline to 15.1 correct items after using the decision aid (mean difference 3.35; p < 0.0001). Decisional conflict scores reduced significantly from baseline to post-test as well (mean difference - 6.5; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that our AML decision aid is a useful tool to improve the patient experience and promote shared decision-making in AML.

We hypothesized that Lepr(+)HSCs are functionally different from other HSCs. Using in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches, we demonstrated that Lepr further differentiates SLAM HSCs into two distinct populations; Lepr(+)HSCs engrafted better than Lepr(-)HSCs in primary transplant. Compared to Lepr(-)LSK cells, Lepr(+)LSK cells were highly enriched for extensively repopulating and self-renewing HSCs. Molecularly, Lepr(+)HSCs were characterized by a pro-inflammatory transcriptomic profile enriched for Type-I Interferon and Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) response pathways, which are known to be critical for the emergence of HSCs in the embryo.

Therefore, new anti-leukemia treatments and mouse models are needed for this combinatorial AML genotype. For this purpose, we first generated a Bcor(-/-) knockout mouse model characterized by impaired erythroid development (macrocytosis and anemia) and enhanced thrombopoiesis, which are both features of myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms. We then created and characterized double Bcor(-/-)/Dnmt3a(-/-) knockout mice. Interestingly, these animals developed a fully penetrant acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) characterized by leukocytosis secondary to the expansion of blasts expressing c-Kit+ and the erythroid marker Ter119, macrocytic anemia and progressive reduction of the thrombocytosis associated with loss of Bcor alone. Transcriptomic analysis of double knockout bone marrow progenitors revealed that aberrant erythroid skewing was induced by epigenetic changes affecting specific transcriptional factors (GATA1-2) and cell-cycle regulators (Mdm2, Tp53).

Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of SYK in AML cells leads to increased differentiation, reduced proliferation, and cellular apoptosis. Herein, we addressed the consequences of SYK inhibition to leukemia stem-cell (LSC) function and assessed SYK-associated pathways in AML cell biology. Using gain-of-function MEK kinase mutant and constitutively active STAT5A, we demonstrate that R406, the active metabolite of a small-molecule SYK inhibitor fostamatinib, induces differentiation and blocks clonogenic potential of AML cells through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway and STAT5A transcription factor, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition of SYK with R406 reduced LSC compartment defined as CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD25(+) in vitro, and decreased viability of LSCs identified by a low abundance of reactive oxygen species. Primary leukemic blasts treated ex vivo with R406 exhibited lower engraftment potential when xenotransplanted to immunodeficient NSG/J mice. Mechanistically, these effects are mediated by disturbed mitochondrial biogenesis and suppression of oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) in LSCs. These mechanisms appear to be partially dependent on inhibition of STAT5 and its target gene MYC, a well-defined inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, inhibition of SYK increases the sensitivity of LSCs to cytarabine (AraC), a standard of AML induction therapy. Taken together, our findings indicate that SYK fosters OXPHOS and participates in metabolic reprogramming of AML LSCs in a mechanism that at least partially involves STAT5, and that SYK inhibition targets LSCs in AML. Since active SYK is expressed in a majority of AML patients and confers inferior prognosis, the combination of SYK inhibitors with standard chemotherapeutics such as AraC constitutes a new therapeutic modality that should be evaluated in future clinical trials.",,"['Polak, Anna', 'Bialopiotrowicz, Emilia', 'Krzymieniewska, Beata', 'Wozniak, Jolanta', 'Stojak, Marta', 'Cybulska, Magdalena',

In spite of a relatively homogeneous clinical disease presentation, risk of long-term survival in AML varies from 20% to 80% depending on molecular disease characteristics. In recognition of the molecular heterogeneity of AML, the European Leukemia Net (ELN) and WHO classification systems now incorporate cytogenetics and increasing numbers of gene mutations into AML prognostication. Several of the genomic AML subsets are characterized by unique transcription factor alterations that are highlighted in this review. There are many mechanisms of transcriptional deregulation in leukemia. We broadly classify transcription factors based on mechanisms of transcriptional deregulation including direct involvement of transcription factors in recurrent translocations, loss-of-function mutations, and intracellular relocalization. Transcription factors, due to their pleiotropic effects, have been attractive but elusive targets. Indirect targeting approaches include inhibition of upstream kinases such as TAK1 for suppression of NFkappaB signaling and downstream effectors such as FGF signaling in HOXA-upregulated leukemia. Other strategies include targeting scaffolding proteins like BrD4 in the case of MYC or coactivators such as menin to suppress HOX expression; disrupting critical protein interactions in the case of beta-catenin:TCF/LEF, and preventing transcription factor binding to DNA as in the case of PU.1 or FOXM1.

In the current studies, we identified a critical role of Kras in regulating alloreactive T cell function during aGVHD. Kras deletion in donor T cells dramatically reduced aGVHD mortality and severity in an MHC-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation mouse model but largely maintained the antitumor capacity. Kras-deficient CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited impaired TCR-induced activation of the ERK pathway. Kras deficiency altered TCR-induced gene expression profiles, including the reduced expression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, Kras deficiency inhibited IL-6-mediated Th17 cell differentiation and impaired IL-6-induced ERK activation and gene expression in CD4 T cells. These findings support Kras as a novel and effective therapeutic target for aGVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Luo, Lan', 'Chen, Yuhong', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Zheng, Yongwei', 'Zhou, Vivian', 'Yu, Mei', 'Burns, Robert', 'Zhu, Wen', 'Fu, Guoping', 'Felix, Juan C', 'Hartley, Christopher', 'Damnernsawad, Alisa', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wen, Renren', 'Drobyski, Williams R', 'Gao, Chunji', 'Wang, Demin']","['Luo L', 'Chen Y', 'Chen X', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhou V', 'Yu M', 'Burns R', 'Zhu W', 'Fu G', 'Felix JC', 'Hartley C', 'Damnernsawad A', 'Zhang J', 'Wen R', 'Drobyski WR', 'Gao C', 'Wang D']","['Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China."", 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226; and.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706.', 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.', ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China."", 'Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI 53226; dwang@versiti.org.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20201106,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC7955895,,,,2020/11/08 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2020/11/07 05:28'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/07 05:28 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Dec 15;205(12):3480-3490. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2000006.

A retrospective study of 55 cases.,,"INTRODUCTION: Mucormycosis with oral involvement (OIM) is a rare opportunistic and lethal mycosis, which has increased in the last decade and is generally associated with uncontrolled diabetes and neutropenia. METHODS: A retrospective study of cases with OIM was carried out in a tertiary-care center. Mycological and histological examinations were performed, and the isolated organisms were identified by morphology and molecular biology. RESULTS: Fifty-five OIM patients were included, with a median age of 38 years (61.8% males). The most frequent associated disease was type-2 diabetes mellitus (61%), followed by neutropenia due to acute lymphocytic leukemia (27%). The main presentation was palatal and mandibular ulcers (92.7%) and, to a lesser extent, gingival and lingual necrosis. The diagnosis was established by mycological and histopathological studies. The most frequent fungi isolated was Rhizopus arrhizus (67.2%). CONCLUSION: OIM is a rapidly progressing disease, therefore, an early diagnosis and the proper control of predisposing factors is necessary, and consequently, contributing to improve the outcome of mucormycosis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiologia', 'Clinica.

However, this method is greatly affected by subjective factors and tends to lead to misdiagnosis. This study proposes using bone marrow cell microscopy images and employs convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with transfer learning to establish an objective, rapid, and accurate method for classification and diagnosis of LKA (AML, ALL, and CML). We collected cell microscopy images of 104 bone marrow smears (including 18 healthy subjects, 53 AML patients, 23 ALL patients, and 18 CML patients). The perfect reflection algorithm and a self-adaptive filter algorithm were first used for preprocessing of bone marrow cell images collected from experiments. Subsequently, 3 CNN frameworks (Inception-V3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) were used to construct classification models for the raw dataset and preprocessed dataset. Transfer learning was used to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Results showed that the DenseNet121 model based on the preprocessed dataset provided the best classification results, with a prediction accuracy of 74.8%. The prediction accuracy of the DenseNet121 model that was obtained by transfer learning optimization was 95.3%, which was increased by 20.5%. In this model, the prediction accuracies of the normal groups, AML, ALL, and CML were 90%, 99%, 97%, and 95%, respectively.

A case of voluminous lymphadenopathy in the context of DAL is presented. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 40-year-old male patient was diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 positive chronic stage CML 2 years ago and achieved complete molecular response on nilotinib, which was switched to dasatinib due to nilotinib intolerance. After 5 months on dasatinib, the patient presented with a large mass in the axillary region. DIAGNOSIS: Common infectious and autoimmune etiologies of lymphadenopathy were ruled out. The positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated a hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy highly suspicious of lymphoma. The subsequent biopsy excluded lymphoma or extramedullary blastic transformation of CML and revealed reactive lymphadenopathy with mixed (cortical and paracortical) pattern. Clinical history and clinicopathological correlation suggested the diagnosis of DAL. INTERVENTION: Dasatinib was discontinued and the patient remained in close follow-up. TKI treatment with nilotinib was reinitiated. OUTCOMES: Lymphadenopathy resolved clinically at 4 weeks and normalization of PET/CT findings was documented at 9 weeks after cessation of the drug. TKI treatment with nilotinib was reinitiated with good tolerance. LESSONS: DAL may present with voluminous lymphadenopathy consistent with malignancy in clinical and imaging workup.

PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1 is a 60-year-old male patient of Senegalese origin presented with weight loss, lymphadenopathy, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenases. Case 2 is a 46-year-old male patient of Algerian origin, with a negative HIV serology presented with cutaneous lesions. DIAGNOSIS: Patient 1: The diagnosis of stage IV lymphocytic lymphoma (LL) was confirmed by an inguinal nodal biopsy in 2013. Patient 2: The diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma was made in 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Patient 1 received 5 cycles of bendamustine and rituximab followed by a complete remission. Patient 2 was initially treated with >10 different treatments followed by 8 different chemotherapy regimens due to the disease progression. OUTCOMES: Patient 1: In 2017, after a follow-up of 4 years, the patient presented with fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia in the setting of hemophagocytic syndrome. The initial diagnosis was a relapse of lymphoma and the patient was treated with ibrutinib. His status worsened, and Leishmania DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the blood and bone marrow aspirates. Ibrutinib was stopped. Amphotericin B treatment induced a complete clinical remission and clearance of Leishmania DNA from the blood.Patient 2: In 2017, after a follow-up of 14 years, the patient presented with fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia with hemophagocytic syndrome, and an increase in the tumor skin lesions. A skin biopsy was taken from the face and the patient. A careful reexamination of the skin biopsy revealed the presence of Leishmania bodies. He was treated with 40 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B leading to a regression of the clinical symptoms and negativation of the blood PCR. CONCLUSIONS: This case study shows that VL may be a diagnostic challenge in patients with lymphoma. Reactivation or primary infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to remind clinicians to think of VL in patients with systemic symptoms that could be misdiagnosed as a progression of the underlying lymphoma.",,"['Kalmi, Galith', 'Vignon-Pennamen, Marie-Dominique', 'Ram-Wolff, Caroline', 'Battistella, Maxime', 'Lafaurie, Mathieu', 'Bouaziz, Jean-David', 'Hamane, Samia', 'Bernard, Sophie', 'Bretagne, Stephane', 'Thieblemont, Catherine', 'Bagot, Martine', 'de Masson, Adele']","['Kalmi G', 'Vignon-Pennamen MD', 'Ram-Wolff C', 'Battistella M', 'Lafaurie M', 'Bouaziz JD', 'Hamane S', 'Bernard S', 'Bretagne S', 'Thieblemont C', 'Bagot M', 'de Masson A']","['Service de Dermatologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'INSERM U976.', 'Laboratoire de Pathologie.', 'Service de Dermatologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'INSERM U976.', 'Laboratoire de Pathologie.', 'Universite de Paris.', 'Departement des maladies infectieuses et tropicales.', 'Service de Dermatologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'INSERM U976.', 'Universite de Paris.', 'Laboratoire de Parasitologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'Universite de Paris.', ""Service d'Hemato-oncologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Parasitologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'Universite de Paris.', 'Universite de Paris.', ""Service d'Hemato-oncologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France."", 'Service de Dermatologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'INSERM U976.', 'Universite de Paris.', 'Service de Dermatologie, APHP, Hopital Saint Louis.', 'INSERM U976.', 'Universite de Paris.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC7647553,,,,2020/11/08 06:00,2020/12/02 06:00,['2020/11/07 01:02'],"['2020/11/07 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Nov 6;99(45):e22787. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000022787.,20201201,10.1097/MD.0000000000022787 [doi],,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000022787 [doi]', '00005792-202011060-00018 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were extracted from the Girona cancer registry. LN incident cases were registered using the ICD-O-3, following the 2008 WHO classification scheme and HAEMACARE grouping. Follow-up was available until the 31/12/2015. Observed and relative survival (RS) were estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Pohar Perme methods, respectively. RESULTS: 4294 LNs diagnosed over a 20-year period were included in the survival analyses. 5-year RS was 62.3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 60.4-64.4), and ranged from 88.5%-41.1% according to subtype. Findings were similar between men and women, while survival decreased markedly with age. RS for all LNs improved during the first two periods of study, being 56.5 % (95 % CI: 53.1-60.0) in 1996-2002, 64.8 % (95 % CI: 61.7-68.2) in 2003-2008, and 65.6 % (95 % CI: 62.0-69.5) in 2009-2015. This pattern was mostly attributed to an improved survival of mature B-cell neoplasms, yet only statistically significant differences were reported for follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides estimates of survival in LNs and its subtypes, allowing comparisons between countries. Survival for overall cases improved across the period of study, yet rates are still poor for most subtypes, evidencing the need of therapeutic research programs.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Both HIV and HTLV-I can be transmitted between individuals through direct contact with certain body fluids from infected individuals. Therefore, a person can be co-infected with both viruses. HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, while HTLV-I is the causative agent for adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Several mathematical models have been developed in the literature to describe the within-host dynamics of HIV and HTLV-I mono-infections. However, modeling a within-host dynamics of HIV/HTLV-I co-infection has not been involved. In the present paper, we are concerned to formulate and analyze a new HIV/HTLV co-infection model under the effect of Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) immune response. The model describes the interaction between susceptible CD4(+)T cells, silent HIV-infected cells, active HIV-infected cells, silent HTLV-infected cells, Tax-expressing HTLV-infected cells, free HIV particles, HIV-specific CTLs and HTLV-specific CTLs. The HIV can spread by two routes of transmission, virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell. On the other side, HTLV-I has two modes of transmission, (i) horizontal transmission via direct cell-to-cell contact, and (ii) vertical transmission through mitotic division of Tax-expressing HTLV-infected cells. The well-posedness of the model is established by showing that the solutions of the model are nonnegative and bounded. We define a set of threshold parameters which govern the existence and stability of all equilibria of the model. We explore the global asymptotic stability of all equilibria by utilizing Lyapunov function and LaSalle's invariance principle. We have presented numerical simulations to justify the applicability and effectiveness of the theoretical results. In addition, we evaluate the effect of HTLV-I infection on the HIV dynamics and vice versa.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We previously showed an association between exposure to ambient particulate matter 2.5 mug (PM2.5) and risk for leukemia in adults. The aim of this study was to investigate which PM2.5 constituents were responsible for our previous observation. METHODS: This is a nationwide register-based case-control study. We identified 14,983 persons diagnosed with leukemia at age 20 or above, 1989-2014, in the Danish Cancer Registry. We selected up to four sex and age-matched controls per case at random from the entire Danish population (n = 51,613). We modelled concentrations of ambient PM2.5 and its constituents at the addresses of cases and controls for the 10-year period before index date with a state-of-the-art multiscale air pollution modeling system. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for individual and neighborhood level socio-demographic variables. RESULT: The results showed higher risk for overall leukemia in association with interquartile range exposure to PM2.5 (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.17), black carbon (BC) (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.03), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.29) and its components ammonium (NH4) (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.17) and nitrate (NO3) (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.14). In leukemia subtype analysis, statistically significant associations were found for AML with PM2.5 (OR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.29), BC (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.07), SIA (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.51), NH4 (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.34) and NO3 (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.24). The association between PM2.5 and leukemia persisted in two pollutants models including sum of primary emitted black and organic carbon (BC + OC), secondary organic aerosols (SOA), or sea-salt. The association between black carbon (BC) and leukemia persisted in two pollutants models including organic carbon (OC). The three pollutant model with sulfate (SO4), NH4 and NO3 showed an association with NO3 but not with SO4 or NH4. CONCLUSION: Ambient concentrations of the PM2.5 components BC, NH4 and NO3 at the residence showed associations with risk of incident leukemia in adults.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.
