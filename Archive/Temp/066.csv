Meanwhile, few allo-SCT data specific to adult T-ALL have been described thus far. Specifically, the optimal myeloablative conditioning regimen is unknown. In this retrospective study, 601 patients were included. Patients received allo-SCT in CR1, CR2, CR >2 or in advanced disease in 69%, 15%, 2% and 14% of cases, respectively. With an overall follow-up of 58 months, 523 patients received a TBI-based regimen, whereas 78 patients received a chemotherapy-based regimen including IV busulfan-cyclophosphamide (IV Bu-Cy) (n=46). Unlike patients aged 35 years, patients aged <35 years who received a TBI-based regimen displayed an improved outcome compared with patients who received a chemotherapy-based regimen (5-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) of 50% for TBI versus 18% for chemo-only regimen or IV Bu-Cy regimens, P=10(-5) and 10(-4), respectively). In multivariate analysis, use of TBI was associated with an improved LFS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.55 (0.34-0.86), P=0.01) and overall survival (HR=0.54 (0.34-0.87), P=0.01) in patients aged <35 years. In conclusion, younger adult patients with T-ALL entitled to receive a myeloablative allo-SCT may benefit from TBI-based regimens.","['Cahu, X', 'Labopin, M', 'Giebel, S', 'Aljurf, M', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, S', 'Socie, G', 'Eder, M', 'Bonifazi, F', 'Bunjes, D', 'Vigouroux, S', 'Michallet, M', 'Stelljes, M', 'Zuckerman, T', 'Finke, J', 'Passweg, J', 'Yakoub-Agha, I', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Sucak, G', 'Sengelov, H', 'Polge, E', 'Nagler, A', 'Esteve, J', 'Mohty, M']","['Cahu X', 'Labopin M', 'Giebel S', 'Aljurf M', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Socie G', 'Eder M', 'Bonifazi F', 'Bunjes D', 'Vigouroux S', 'Michallet M', 'Stelljes M', 'Zuckerman T', 'Finke J', 'Passweg J', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Niederwieser D', 'Sucak G', 'Sengelov H', 'Polge E', 'Nagler A', 'Esteve J', 'Mohty M']","['Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Pontchaillou, CHU Rennes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'Universite Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR_S 938, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Onco-Hematology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Adult Hematology/HSCT, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Hematology-Transplantation, Hospital St Louis, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', ""Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences 'L. and A.

However, recent advances in the understanding of CLL biology and the approval of agents in novel treatment classes have offered significant advances in the management of the disease. METHODS: The author reviewed current treatment goals in CLL management, including issues surrounding complete remission (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD); the findings of trials of treatments from novel drug classes, primarily kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies; and current strategies for use of standard and novel therapies for treatment of individuals diagnosed with CLL, particularly elderly patients. RESULTS: Several agents and regimens featuring improved clinical outcomes and tolerability are now available or in advanced development for the management of CLL patients, including the elderly and those with high-risk disease. These include ibrutinib, idelalisib plus rituximab, and obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. CONCLUSION: The availability of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors and other novel therapies will allow elderly CLL patients to receive more efficacious treatment with greater tolerability than available with traditional approaches for management of the disease.","['Barrientos, Jacqueline C']",['Barrientos JC'],"['Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, CLL Research and Treatment Program, New Hyde Park, NY 11042, USA. jbarrientos@nshs.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Frail Elderly', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy/methods']",2015/12/01 06:00,2016/07/21 06:00,['2015/12/01 06:00'],"['2015/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/107327481502204s04 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2015 Oct;22(4 Suppl):17-23. doi: 10.1177/107327481502204s04.,"['UL1 TR000457/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL-1TR00457/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4763599,['NIHMS758957'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors first reviewed the most recent findings concerning CLL cytogenetics, molecular biology, and prognostic models. They then surveyed recent and ongoing trials of novel CLL agents and strategies, with a focus on those most relevant to elderly patients. RESULTS: Novel therapies, revised staging procedures, and careful assessment of individual patients' frailty and functional status will allow clinicians to provide optimal care management for older CLL patients.

METHODS: The authors reviewed current epidemiology and guidelines for treatment of CLL, as well as recently approved therapies and studies of physiological aging. RESULTS: Determination of physiological age and performance of a thorough geriatric assessment play critical roles in the selection of optimal therapeutic approaches for older patients diagnosed with CLL. CONCLUSION: Older age, expressed via a frailty index, is a prognostic factor for poorer outcome in patients with CLL. However, several novel treatment options may result in reduced mortality and lessened treatment-related toxicity in older CLL patients.","['Balducci, Lodovico', 'Dolan, Dawn']","['Balducci L', 'Dolan D']","['Senior Adult Oncology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

It generally involves the skin and has an aggressive clinical course. Due to its highly malignant behavior, a fast and accurate diagnosis of this condition is of the utmost importance. METHODS: Six cytology specimens from 5 patients diagnosed with BPDCN were reviewed as well as their clinical records. Findings were compared with 3 previously published cases. RESULTS: Two exfoliative cytology specimens (cerebrospinal fluid) and 4 fine-needle aspiration specimens (3 lymph node specimens and 1 cutaneous specimen) were reviewed. The cytomorphological aspects were similar in all cases. The smears were hypercellular with a monotonous population of intermediate-sized cells, dispersed singly or arranged in loose aggregates. The cells had round to oval nuclei, with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli; the cytoplasm was generally scant, without visible granules. Intracytoplasmic microvacuoles were found in the majority of cases. Four cases were also characterized by flow cytometry, which revealed expression of CD 123, CD56 and/or CD4. Fine-needle aspiration was used in 1 case for primary diagnosis. Histological confirmation was available in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: BPDCN is a highly malignant neoplasm with a poor outcome. Cytology, in association with flow cytometry immunophenotyping and clinical history, is a reliable method with which to establish the diagnosis.","['Ferreira, Joana', 'Gasparinho, Maria Gabriela', 'Fonseca, Ricardo']","['Ferreira J', 'Gasparinho MG', 'Fonseca R']","['Pathology Department, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Pathology Department, Fernando Fonseca Hospital, Hospital Fernando da Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal.', 'Pathology Department, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151130,United States,Cancer Cytopathol,Cancer cytopathology,101499453,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/*cytology', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology']",2015/12/01 06:00,2016/08/17 06:00,['2015/12/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncy.21645 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Cytopathol. 2016 Mar;124(3):196-202. doi: 10.1002/cncy.21645.

Because imatinib induces apoptosis, which may be coupled with mitochondria and DNA damage is a prototype apoptosis-inducing factor, we hypothesized that imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells might differentially express apoptosis-related mitochondrially encoded genes in response to genotoxic stress. We investigated the effect of doxorubicin (DOX), a DNA-damaging anticancer drug, on apoptosis and the expression of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 3 (MT-ND3) and cytochrome b (MT-CYB) in model CML cells showing imatinib resistance caused by Y253H mutation in the BCR-ABL1 gene (253) or culturing imatinib-sensitive (S) cells in increasing concentrations of imatinib (AR). The imatinib-resistant 253 cells displayed higher sensitivity to apoptosis induced by 1 muM DOX and this was confirmed by an increased activity of executioner caspases 3 and 7 in those cells. Native mitochondrial potential was lower in imatinib-resistant cells than in their sensitive counterparts and DOX lowered it. MT-CYB mRNA expression in 253 cells was lower than that in S cells and 0.1 muM DOX kept this relationship. In conclusion, imatinib resistance may be associated with altered mitochondrial response to genotoxic stress, which may be further exploited in CML therapy in patients with imatinib resistance.","['Synowiec, Ewelina', 'Hoser, Grazyna', 'Bialkowska-Warzecha, Jolanta', 'Pawlowska, Elzbieta', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Synowiec E', 'Hoser G', 'Bialkowska-Warzecha J', 'Pawlowska E', 'Skorski T', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Flow Cytometry, Medical Center for Postgraduate Education, Marymoncka 99, 01-813 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Infectious and Liver Diseases, Medical University of Lodz, Kniaziewicza 1/5, 92-347 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Orthodontics, Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska 251, 92-216 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151104,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, Mitochondrial/*drug effects/genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2015/12/01 06:00,2016/09/09 06:00,['2015/12/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/673512 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:673512. doi: 10.1155/2015/673512.

Using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-based reporter system, we recently identified differences in the removal of enzyme-mediated DSB in human HSPC versus mature peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), particularly regarding homologous DSB repair (HR). Assessment of chromosomal breaks via premature chromosome condensation or gammaH2AX foci indicated similar efficiency and kinetics of radiation-induced DSB formation and rejoining in PBL and HSPC. Prolonged persistence of chromosomal breaks was observed for higher LET charged particles which are known to induce more complex DNA damage compared to X-rays. Consistent with HR deficiency in HSPC observed in our previous study, we noticed here pronounced focal accumulation of 53BP1 after X-ray and carbon ion exposure (intermediate LET) in HSPC versus PBL. For higher LET, 53BP1 foci kinetics was similarly delayed in PBL and HSPC suggesting similar failure to repair complex DNA damage.

This study has investigated the presence of JAK2 mutation (V617F) in Egyptian patients with myeloproliferative disorders referred to National Cancer institute, Cairo University. METHODS: The study involved 110 cases of Philadelphia negative Myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs), 70 cases with Polycythemia Vera (PV), 24 cases with Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and 16 cases with Idiopathic Myelofibrosis (IMF) and 20 cases as a control group which represented as; (10 cases with secondary erythrocytosis, 1 case with reactive thrombocytosis, 4 cases as normal control and 5 as Philadelphia positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cases), they were collected from National Cancer Institute (NCI) over 3 years. We used ARMS technique for mutation detection. RESULTS: The frequency of the V617F JAK2 mutation was highest in patients with PV where 56 out of 70 cases (80%) carried the mutation, followed by ET with 6 of 24 (25) and IMF with 2 of 16 (12.5%) . None of the cases with secondary Erythrocytosis, reactive thrombocytosis, the normal controls or Philadelphia positive CML cases carried the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are concordant with international published results for detection of this mutation. It is unequivocal now that V617F is met in many MPDs especially PRV. Finding this mutation in those patients is thought to have a big impact on the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.","['Ebid, Gamal T', 'Ghareeb, Mohamed', 'Salaheldin, Omina', 'Kamel, Mahmoud M']","['Ebid GT', 'Ghareeb M', 'Salaheldin O', 'Kamel MM']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Ahmed Maher Education Hospital Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University Giza, Egypt.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150901,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/genetics']",2015/12/01 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/12/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2015 Sep 1;8(9):11555-9. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4637706,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ARMS', 'Egypt', 'JAK2 mutation', 'essential thrombocytosis', 'idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF)', 'myeloproliferative disorders', 'polycythemia vera']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) increases progressively with age and its treatment is challenging. This prospective case control study was undertaken to compare the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of decitabine with those of cytarabine in older patients with newly diagnosed AML who are not fit for intensive chemotherapy. Materials and Methods. 30 eligible patients above 60 years old with newly diagnosed AML were assigned to receive decitabine or cytarabine. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary objective was to compare adverse events and cost-effectiveness of therapy in the two study groups. Results. In this study, 15 patients received decitabine and 15 patients received cytarabine. The median OS was 5.5 months for each of the treatment groups. The hazard ratio between the treatment groups was 0.811 with 95% CI of 0.390 to 1.687. Toxicity profile was similar in both groups. Cost per cycle of chemotherapy in INR was 24,200 for decitabine and 1,600 for low-dose cytarabine group. Median of simplified cost-effectiveness ratio was 0.00022 for decitabine group and 0.0034 for low-dose cytarabine group. Conclusions. For elderly patients with AML, decitabine and low-dose cytarabine should be chosen based on the patient's choice and affordability. Our study has shown that both of these agents have similar OS and toxicity. Low-dose cytarabine scores over decitabine in developing countries as it is more cost-effective.","['Jacob, Linu A', 'Aparna, S', 'Lakshmaiah, K C', 'Lokanatha, D', 'Babu, Govind', 'Babu, Suresh', 'Appachu, Sandhya']","['Jacob LA', 'Aparna S', 'Lakshmaiah KC', 'Lokanatha D', 'Babu G', 'Babu S', 'Appachu S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Dr. M.

In addition, 25% of AML patients harbour a FLT3-ITD mutation, associated with inferior outcome due to increased relapse rate. Relapse might be propagated by interactions between AML blasts and the bone marrow microenvironment. Besides cellular elements of the microenvironment (e.g. mesenchymal stromal cells), bone marrow hypoxia has emerged as an additional crucial component. Hence, effects of hypoxia on FLT3 expression and biology could provide novel insight into AML biology. Here we show that 25% of AML patients down-regulate FLT3 expression on blasts in response to in vitro hypoxia (1% O2), which was independent of its mutational state. While virtually no AML cell lines regulate FLT3 in response to hypoxia, the down-regulation could be observed in Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with different FLT3 mutants. Hypoxia-mediated down-regulation was specific for FLT3, reversible and proteasome-dependent; with FLT3 half-life being significantly shorter at hypoxia. Also, PI-3K inhibition could partially abrogate down-regulation of FLT3. Hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of FLT3 conferred resistance against cytarabine in vitro. In conclusion, FLT3 expression in AML is dependent on the oxygen partial pressure, but response to hypoxia differs.","['Sironi, Silvia', 'Wagner, Michaela', 'Kuett, Alexander', 'Drolle, Heidrun', 'Polzer, Harald', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Rieger, Christina', 'Fiegl, Michael']","['Sironi S', 'Wagner M', 'Kuett A', 'Drolle H', 'Polzer H', 'Spiekermann K', 'Rieger C', 'Fiegl M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Leukemia, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Leukemia, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151130,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)'],IM,"['Blood Gas Analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Mutation', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Prognosis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",2015/12/01 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/12/01 06:00'],"['2015/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['srep17550 [pii]', '10.1038/srep17550 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Nov 30;5:17550. doi: 10.1038/srep17550.,,PMC4663471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a numerous mechanisms regulate its expression and function, they are often altered in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and T-cell lymphomas. As such, PTEN inactivation frequently occurs in these malignancies, where it can be associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Different Pten knockout models recapitulated the development of T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, demonstrating that PTEN loss is at the center of a complex oncogenic network that sustains and drives tumorigenesis via the activation of multiple signalling pathways.

Of significant interest is the role PPIs play in regulating apoptosis. The overexpression of the antiapoptosis regulating Bcl-2 family of proteins is commonly observed in several cancers, leading to resistance towards both radiation and chemotherapies. From this family, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has proven the most difficult to target, and one of the leading causes of treatment resistance. Exploiting the selective PPI between the apoptosis-regulating protein Noxa and Mcl-1, utilising a fluorescence polarization assay, we have identified four small molecules with the ability to modulate Mcl-1. The identified compounds were computationally modelled and docked against the Mcl-1 binding interface to obtain structural information about their binding sites allowing for future analogue design. When examined for their activity towards pancreatic cell lines that overexpress Mcl-1 (MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3), the identified compounds demonstrated growth inhibition, suggesting effective Mcl-1 modulation.","['Beekman, Andrew M', ""O'Connell, Maria A"", 'Howell, Lesley A']","['Beekman AM', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Howell LA']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, Norfolk, NR4 7TJ, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, Norfolk, NR4 7TJ, UK.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, Norfolk, NR4 7TJ, UK.

Though progress has been made in identifying the underlying mutations, in most patients the genetic basis is unknown. Two de novo mutated candidate genes, MCM3AP encoding germinal center-associated nuclear protein (GANP) and POMP encoding proteasome maturation protein (POMP), were identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in a child with complex phenotype displaying immunodeficiency, genomic instability, skin changes, and myelodysplasia. GANP was previously described to promote B-cell maturation by nuclear targeting of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and to control AID-dependent hyperrecombination. POMP is required for 20S proteasome assembly and, thus, for efficient NF-kappaB signaling. Patient-derived cells were characterized by impaired homologous recombination, moderate radio- and cross-linker sensitivity associated with accumulation of damage, impaired DNA damage-induced NF-kappaB signaling, and reduced nuclear AID levels. Complementation by wild-type (WT)-GANP normalized DNA repair and WT-POMP rescued defective NF-kappaB signaling. In conclusion, we identified for the first time mutations in MCM3AP and POMP in an immunodeficiency patient. These mutations lead to cooperative effects on DNA recombination and damage signaling. Digenic/polygenic mutations may constitute a novel genetic basis in immunodeficiency patients with DNA repair defects.","['Gatz, Susanne A', 'Salles, Daniela', 'Jacobsen, Eva-Maria', 'Dork, Thilo', 'Rausch, Tobias', 'Aydin, Sevtap', 'Surowy, Harald', 'Volcic, Meta', 'Vogel, Walther', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Stutz, Adrian M', 'Schwarz, Klaus', 'Pannicke, Ulrich', 'Hess, Timo', 'Korbel, Jan O', 'Schulz, Ansgar S', 'Schumacher, Johannes', 'Wiesmuller, Lisa']","['Gatz SA', 'Salles D', 'Jacobsen EM', 'Dork T', 'Rausch T', 'Aydin S', 'Surowy H', 'Volcic M', 'Vogel W', 'Debatin KM', 'Stutz AM', 'Schwarz K', 'Pannicke U', 'Hess T', 'Korbel JO', 'Schulz AS', 'Schumacher J', 'Wiesmuller L']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'Gynecology Research Unit, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, D-30625, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Genome Biology Unit, Heidelberg, D-69117, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89081, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89081, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Genome Biology Unit, Heidelberg, D-69117, Germany.', 'Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Ulm University and Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, D-89081, Germany.', 'Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Ulm University and Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, D-89081, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Biomedical Center, University of Bonn, Bonn, D-53127, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Genome Biology Unit, Heidelberg, D-69117, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Biomedical Center, University of Bonn, Bonn, D-53127, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University, Ulm, D-89075, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151230,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (proteasome maturation protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (MCM3AP protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Damage/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA Repair/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Chaperones/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology']",2015/12/01 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2015/12/01 06:00'],"['2015/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/humu.22939 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2016 Mar;37(3):257-68. doi: 10.1002/humu.22939.

Studies of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gene polymorphisms are scarce. The LIF single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) thymine (T)/guanine (G) (rs929271) was studied in women to determine whether an association existed with pregnancy outcomes after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI); 411 women who underwent ICSI were recruited. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood, and the LIF gene SNP T/G (rs929271) was genotyped using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Participants were divided into three groups according to their LIF genotype: T/T (n = 168), T/G (n = 202) and G/G (n = 41). All IVF and ICSI procedures were carried out under the same clinical and laboratory conditions. The ICSI cumulative results (from fresh plus frozen cycles) of each genotype group were analysed. The G/G genotype in women was associated with a higher implantation rate (T/T: 15.9%, T/G: 16.2%, G/G: 27.0%; P < 0.05), ongoing pregnancy rate/patient (T/T: 31.5%, T/G: 36.1%, G/G: 53.7%; P < 0.05) and ongoing pregnancy rate/transfer (T/T: 18.5%, T/G: 20.2%, G/G: 36.7%; P < 0.05).

The present study demonstrated for the first time that 13OD displayed potent cytotoxicity against chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells in vitro. 13OD inhibited proliferation, induced G2/M phase arrest, and exhibited potent apoptotic activity in K562 cells. In K562 cells, 13OD disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced high level of ROS, which played an indispensable role in 13OD-induced apoptosis. Further investigations on the molecular mechanisms revealed that total Akt protein level was decreased in a caspase-dependent way after treatment with 13OD; in addition, ERK was activated by 13OD, and this activation played a protective role in 13OD stimulation. Altogether, these results revealed that the cytotoxic ingenol derivative 13OD induced apoptosis with novel mechanisms for the proapoptotic function in cancer cells, and suggested that 13OD may serve as a lead template for rational drug design and for future anticancer agent development.","['Liu, Ming', 'Zhang, Weiyi', 'Wang, Genzhu', 'Song, Xiaoping', 'Zhao, Xingzeng', 'Wang, Xiangyun', 'Qi, Xin', 'Li, Jing']","['Liu M', 'Zhang W', 'Wang G', 'Song X', 'Zhao X', 'Wang X', 'Qi X', 'Li J']","['Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences (Nanjing Botanical Garden, Mem.

Imatinib mesylate, followed by nilotinib and dasatinib, has been approved for newly diagnosed patients. Since none of these TKIs show survival superiority, the drug choice is a challenge. Even so, the rate of deeper and earlier responses is higher with second-generation TKIs than it is with imatinib, and, in general, better response is associated with a survival advantage, regardless of TKI type being used. Patients should be monitored carefully for response, and treatment failure should prompt a timely switch to another TKI. Side effect profile and drug cost are other important considerations in therapy choice. In several clinical studies, achieving undetectable and durable disease status allowed some patients to discontinue the TKI and enjoy long-term treatment-free remission. Cure for CML may be possible with TKIs alone or TKIs in combination with other investigational therapies. However, due to lack of long-term outcome data and absence of consensus for the definition of optimal response and time to stop TKIs, discontinuation is discouraged outside of a clinical trial.","['Yilmaz, Musa', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Yilmaz M', 'Jabbour E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Several different non-chemotherapy approaches are being used to target relapsed and refractory HCL, including inhibitors of BRAF, but so far only monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based approaches have been reported to eliminate MRD in a high percentage of patients. One of the MAb-based options for HCL currently under clinical investigation involves recombinant immunotoxins, containing a fragment of a MAb and a bacterial toxin. The bacterial toxin, a highly potent fragment from Pseudomonas exotoxin, catalytically ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2 (EF2), resulting in protein synthesis inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Recombinant immunotoxins tested in HCL patients include LMB-2, targeting CD25, and BL22, targeting CD22. An affinity matured version of BL22, termed moxetumomab pasudotox (formerly HA22 or CAT-8015) achieved high CR rates in phase I, and is currently undergoing multicenter Phase 3 testing. Phase I testing was without dose-limiting toxicity, although 2 patients had grade 2 hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) with transient grade 1 abnormalities in platelets and creatinine. Preclinical work is underway to identify residues on moxetumomab pasudotox leading to immunogenicity. Moxetumomab pasudotox is undergoing pivotal testing for relapsed and refractory HCL.","['Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['The Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 37/5124b, 9000 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.

Although better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms in HCL have led to effective and novel options for the treatment of relapse, long term durability of the responses obtained with these agents still remains unclear. Combination of nucleoside analogs with monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab has been shown to be safe and effective and has the potential to supersede the nucleoside analogs as the frontline strategy.

Histologically, the cells have a characteristic appearance with pale/clear cytoplasm and round or reniform nuclei. In the spleen, the infiltrate involves the red pulp and is frequently associated with areas of haemorrhage (blood lakes). The cells stain for B-cell related antigens as well as with antibodies against tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, DBA44 (CD72), CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD123, cyclin D1 and annexin A1. Mutation of BRAF -V600E is present and antibody to the mutant protein can be used as a specific marker. Bone marrow biopsy is essential in the initial assessment of disease as the bone marrow may be inaspirable or unrepresentative of degree of marrow infiltration as a result of the tumour associated fibrosis preventing aspiration of the tumour cell component. Bone marrow biopsy is important in the assessment of therapy response but in this context staining for CD11c and Annexin A1 is not helpful as they are also markers of myeloid lineage and identification of low level infiltration may be obscured. In this context staining for CD20 may be used in conjunction with morphological assessment and staining of serial sections for cyclin D1 and DBA44 to identify subtle residual infiltration. Staining for CD79a and CD19 is not recommended as these antibodies will identify plasma cells and can lead to over-estimation of disease. Staining for CD20 should not be used in patients following with anti-CD20 based treatments. Down regulation of cyclin D1 and CD25 has been reported in patients following BRAF inhibitor therapy and assessment of these antigens should not be used in this context. Histologically, hairy cell leukaemia needs to be distinguished from other B-cell lymphoproliferations associated with splenomegaly including splenic marginal zone lymphoma, splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma and hairy cell leukaemia variant. This can be done by assessment of the spleen but as this is now rarely performed in this disorder distinction is almost always possible by a combination of morphological and immunophenotypic studies on bone marrow trephine biopsy, which can be supplemented by assessment of BRAF-V600E mutation assessment in borderline cases.","['Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Attygalle, Ayoma', 'Mendes, Larissa Sena Teixeira']","['Wotherspoon A', 'Attygalle A', 'Mendes LS']","['Department of Histopathology, Royal Marsden Hopsital, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK.

The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk.

Initially a uniformly fatal disease, new therapies in rapid succession transformed HCL into a chronic disease with a normal life expectancy in many cases. More recently, the identification of BRAFV600E mutations in the majority of patients with classic HCL have enabled targeted therapies as a therapeutic option. Additional discoveries into the biology of the disease have identified new subtypes of HCL. Modern approaches to the evaluation and treatment of HCL include detailed molecular analysis which informs therapeutic options, which may consist of traditional therapies such as purine nucleoside analogs, or targeted therapies with antibodies, BTK inhibitors, or BRAF inhibitors, or combination therapy. Because HCL is a rare disease, continued progress depends on patients being enrolled on clinical trials whenever possible.","['Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Grever, Michael R']","['Andritsos LA', 'Grever MR']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, 320 West 10th Avenue, A352 Starling Loving Hall, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.

Other than for the mouse, the systematic characterization of mammalian PGCs is still lacking, especially the process by which PGCs convert to pluripotency. This hampers the understanding of germ cell development and the derivation of authenticated EGCs from other species. We observed the morphological development of the genital ridge from Bama miniature pigs and found primary sexual differentiation in the E28 porcine embryo, coinciding with Blimp1 nuclear exclusion in PGCs. To explore molecular events involved in porcine PGC reprogramming, transcriptome data of porcine EGCs and fetal fibroblasts (FFs) were assembled and 1169 differentially expressed genes were used for Gene Ontology analysis. These genes were significantly enriched in cell-surface receptor-linked signal transduction, in agreement with the activation of LIF/Stat3 signaling and FGF signaling during the derivation of porcine EG-like cells. Using a growth-factor-defined culture system, we explored the effects of bFGF on the process and found that bFGF not only functioned at the very beginning of PGC dedifferentiation by impeding Blimp1 nuclear expression via a PI3K/AKT-dependent pathway but also maintained the viability of cultured PGCs thereafter.

It housed workers of the earliest and one of the country's largest nuclear facilities. Workers of the nuclear reactors, radiochemical or reprocessing plants were exposed to high levels of ionising radiation in the early years of operation and possibly further exposed from inhalation of plutonium aerosols. METHODS: The cause-of-death registry of Ozyorsk received paper copies of original death certificates of all deaths of residents of the city. Data were analysed for recent mortality rates (1998-2010) and time trends in age-standardised mortality rates between 1953 and 2010 of main groups of causes of deaths, in particular cancer. RESULTS: Comparing workers of the three main plant types with the remainder of the Ozyorsk residents, and with national figures, all-cause mortality rates were lowest among workers, with ratios compared to national figures of 0.65 (men) and 0.56 (women), and compared to the other residents of 0.77 (men) and of 0.74 (women). For cancer overall, the differences were smaller in men (ratio between workers and national figures of 0.86) and there were no differences in women (ratio of 1.00), but ratios differed by cancer type. Most cancer deaths were however least common in the workers, including leukaemia. Over the last 60 years, all-cause mortality has gradually increased among men in all three groups but was stable among women, whereas cancer death rates have slightly declined in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy worker effect, relatively better living conditions in Ozyorsk and healthier lifestyles may explain the lower mortality rates in Ozyorsk. Overall mortality time trends in Ozyorsk were similar to the entire country. No apparent radiation-related effects were seen in this population-level analysis, but the radiation-related risks can be better addressed in individual-level studies.","['Deltour, Isabelle', 'Tretyakov, Fyodor', 'Tsareva, Yulia', 'Azizova, Tamara V', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Deltour I', 'Tretyakov F', 'Tsareva Y', 'Azizova TV', 'Schuz J']","['Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 cours Albert Thomas, F-69372, Lyon, France. deltouri@iarc.fr.', 'Clinical Department Southern Urals Biophysics Institute (SUBI), Ozyorsk, Russian Federation. inter_dep@subi.su.', 'Epidemiology Laboratory, Southern Urals Biophysics Institute (SUBI), Ozyorsk, Russian Federation. tsareva@subi.su.', 'Clinical Department Southern Urals Biophysics Institute (SUBI), Ozyorsk, Russian Federation. clinic@subi.su.', 'Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 cours Albert Thomas, F-69372, Lyon, France.

As gut microbes influence host immunity and metabolism, we investigated the role of the gut microbiota in the therapeutic management of cancer and associated cachexia. A community-wide analysis of the caecal microbiome in two mouse models of cancer cachexia (acute leukaemia or subcutaneous transplantation of colon cancer cells) identified common microbial signatures, including decreased Lactobacillus spp. and increased Enterobacteriaceae and Parabacteroides goldsteinii/ASF 519. Building on this information, we administered a synbiotic containing inulin-type fructans and live Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23 to leukaemic mice. This treatment restored the Lactobacillus population and reduced the Enterobacteriaceae levels. It also reduced hepatic cancer cell proliferation, muscle wasting and morbidity, and prolonged survival. Administration of the synbiotic was associated with restoration of the expression of antimicrobial proteins controlling intestinal barrier function and gut immunity markers, but did not impact the portal metabolomics imprinting of energy demand. In summary, this study provided evidence that the development of cancer outside the gut can impact intestinal homeostasis and the gut microbial ecosystem and that a synbiotic intervention, by targeting some alterations of the gut microbiota, confers benefits to the host, prolonging survival and reducing cancer proliferation and cachexia.","['Bindels, Laure B', 'Neyrinck, Audrey M', 'Claus, Sandrine P', 'Le Roy, Caroline I', 'Grangette, Corinne', 'Pot, Bruno', 'Martinez, Ines', 'Walter, Jens', 'Cani, Patrice D', 'Delzenne, Nathalie M']","['Bindels LB', 'Neyrinck AM', 'Claus SP', 'Le Roy CI', 'Grangette C', 'Pot B', 'Martinez I', 'Walter J', 'Cani PD', 'Delzenne NM']","['Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.', 'Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.', 'Lactic Acid Bacteria and Mucosal Immunity, Centre for Infection and Immunity of Lille, INSERM U1019-CNRS UMR 8204, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Universite Lille Nord de France, Lille, France.', 'Lactic Acid Bacteria and Mucosal Immunity, Centre for Infection and Immunity of Lille, INSERM U1019-CNRS UMR 8204, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Universite Lille Nord de France, Lille, France.', 'Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Walloon Excellence in Life sciences and BIOtechnology (WELBIO), Louvain Drug Research Institute, UCL, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151127,England,ISME J,The ISME journal,101301086,"['0 (Fructans)', '9005-80-5 (Inulin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bacteroidetes/drug effects/growth & development', 'Cachexia/*microbiology/therapy', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*microbiology/therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/growth & development', 'Female', 'Fructans/administration & dosage', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects/*physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines/microbiology', 'Inulin/administration & dosage', 'Lactobacillus/drug effects/growth & development/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*microbiology/therapy', 'Metabolomics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Synbiotics/*administration & dosage']",2015/11/28 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ismej2015209 [pii]', '10.1038/ismej.2015.209 [doi]']",ppublish,ISME J. 2016 Jun;10(6):1456-70. doi: 10.1038/ismej.2015.209.

In addition to chronic stress in social and work environments, physical and chemical exposures at home, at work, and during leisure activities are causal or contributing environmental stressors that deserve attention by the general practitioner as well as by all other members of the health care community. It seems certainly necessary now to take ""new exposures"" like electromagnetic field (EMF) into account. Physicians are increasingly confronted with health problems from unidentified causes. Studies, empirical observations, and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. Individual susceptibility and environmental factors are frequently neglected. New wireless technologies and applications have been introduced without any certainty about their health effects, raising new challenges for medicine and society. For instance, the issue of so-called non-thermal effects and potential long-term effects of low-dose exposure were scarcely investigated prior to the introduction of these technologies. Common EMF sources include Wi-Fi access points, routers and clients, cordless and mobile phones including their base stations, Bluetooth devices, ELF magnetic fields from net currents, ELF electric fields from electric lamps and wiring close to the bed and office desk. On the one hand, there is strong evidence that long-term-exposure to certain EMF exposures is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer's disease and male infertility. On the other hand, the emerging electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities, disability administrators and case workers, politicians, as well as courts of law. We recommend treating EHS clinically as part of the group of chronic multisystem illnesses (CMI) leading to a functional impairment (EHS), but still recognizing that the underlying cause remains the environment. In the beginning, EHS symptoms often occur only occasionally, but over time they may increase in frequency and severity. Common EHS symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleeping problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue and flu-like symptoms. A comprehensive medical history, which should include all symptoms and their occurrences in spatial and temporal terms and in the context of EMF exposures, is the key to the diagnosis. The EMF exposure can be assessed by asking for typical sources like Wi-Fi access points, routers and clients, cordless and mobile phones and measurements at home and at work. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure, that is, reducing or eliminating all sources of EMF at home and in the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools, hospitals, public transport, and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). If a detrimental EMF exposure is reduced sufficiently, the body has a chance to recover and EHS symptoms will be reduced or even disappear. Many examples have shown that such measures can prove effective. Also the survival rate of children with leukemia depends on ELF magnetic field exposure at home. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment, the broad range of other environmental factors that contribute to the total body burden should also be addressed. Anything that supports a balanced homeostasis will increase a person's resilience against disease and thus against the adverse effects of EMF exposure. There is increasing evidence that EMF exposure has a major impact on the oxidative and nitrosative regulation capacity in affected individuals. This concept also may explain why the level of susceptibility to EMF can change and why the number of symptoms reported in the context of EMF exposures is so large. Based on our current understanding, a treatment approach that minimizes the adverse effects of peroxynitrite - as has been increasingly used in the treatment of multisystem disorders - works best. This EMF Guideline gives an overview of the current knowledge regarding EMF-related health risks and provides concepts for the diagnosis and treatment and accessibility measures of EHS to improve and restore individual health outcomes as well as for the development of strategies for prevention.","['Belyaev, Igor', 'Dean, Amy', 'Eger, Horst', 'Hubmann, Gerhard', 'Jandrisovits, Reinhold', 'Johansson, Olle', 'Kern, Markus', 'Kundi, Michael', 'Lercher, Piero', 'Mosgoller, Wilhelm', 'Moshammer, Hanns', 'Muller, Kurt', 'Oberfeld, Gerd', 'Ohnsorge, Peter', 'Pelzmann, Peter', 'Scheingraber, Claus', 'Thill, Roby']","['Belyaev I', 'Dean A', 'Eger H', 'Hubmann G', 'Jandrisovits R', 'Johansson O', 'Kern M', 'Kundi M', 'Lercher P', 'Mosgoller W', 'Moshammer H', 'Muller K', 'Oberfeld G', 'Ohnsorge P', 'Pelzmann P', 'Scheingraber C', 'Thill R']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",,Germany,Rev Environ Health,Reviews on environmental health,0425754,,,,2015/11/28 06:00,2015/11/28 06:01,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/reveh-2015-0033 [doi]', '/j/reveh.2015.30.issue-4/reveh-2015-0033/reveh-2015-0033.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Rev Environ Health. 2015;30(4):337-71. doi: 10.1515/reveh-2015-0033.,,,,,,,,,,,['Rev Environ Health. doi/10.1515/reveh-2015-0033'],,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow niche is characterised by a low oxygen content resulting in high expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha in leukaemic cells conferring a negative prognosis to patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS AND RESULTS: In the current study, we investigated the impact of hypoxic vs. normoxic conditions on the sensitivity of AML cell lines and primary AML blasts to cytarabine. AML cells cultured under 6% oxygen were significantly more resistant against cytarabine compared to cells cultured under normoxic conditions in proliferation and colony-formation assays. Interestingly upon cultivation under hypoxia, the expression of the cytarabine-activating enzyme deoxycytidine kinase was downregulated in all analysed AML cell lines and primary AML samples representing a possible mechanism for resistance to chemotherapy. Furthermore, the downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase could be associated with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha as treatment with its inhibitor BAY87-2243 hampered the downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase expression under hypoxic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data reveal that hypoxia-induced downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase represents one stroma-cell-independent mechanism of drug resistance to cytarabine in acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Degwert, Nicole', 'Latuske, Emily', 'Vohwinkel, Gabi', 'Stamm, Hauke', 'Klokow, Marianne', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin']","['Degwert N', 'Latuske E', 'Vohwinkel G', 'Stamm H', 'Klokow M', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Fiedler W', 'Wellbrock J']","['Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151228,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2015/11/28 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12711 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Sep;97(3):239-44. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12711.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime treatment costs and health outcomes for TKI sequences for treatment of patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib. Five health states were included, chronic phase 2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses were conducted for key inputs. RESULTS: In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences provide the most survival (DeltaLYs = 0.2-2.0), QALYs (DeltaQALYs = 0.2-1.9), and accrue highest CML-related costs (DeltaCosts = $64,000-$222,000). The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs imatinib-initiating sequences is $100,000 for an imatinib-resistant population. The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs nilotinib-initiating sequences is $170,000 for an imatinib-resistant population, and $160,000 for an imatinib-intolerant population. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that dasatinib is associated with increased survival and quality of life compared to high dose imatinib and to a smaller extent with nilotinib, among patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib, primarily based on higher cytogenetic response rates observed in clinical studies of dasatinib. Head-to-head studies of sequential use of dasatinib and nilotinib are needed to validate the model findings of improved survival (LYs) with better quality-of-life (QALYs) for patients initiating dasatinib in 2nd-line. However, the model findings (in light of higher cytogenetic response rates with dasatinib) are supported by other studies showing improved quality-of-life for responders, and improved survival for patients achieving cytogenetic response.","['Whalen, John', 'Stillman, Ipek', 'Ambavane, Apoorva', 'Felber, Eugene', 'Makenbaeva, Dinara', 'Bolinder, Bjorn']","['Whalen J', 'Stillman I', 'Ambavane A', 'Felber E', 'Makenbaeva D', 'Bolinder B']","['a a Evidera Inc. , London , UK.', 'b b Evidera , Lexington , MA , USA.', 'a a Evidera Inc. , London , UK.', 'c c Bristol-Myers Squibb , Plainsboro , NJ , USA.', 'c c Bristol-Myers Squibb , Plainsboro , NJ , USA.', 'c c Bristol-Myers Squibb , Plainsboro , NJ , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151222,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Health Services/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Econometric', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/11/28 06:00,2017/01/24 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696998.2015.1126285 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2016;19(5):445-61. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2015.1126285.

Much research has been performed on Tualang Honey and it was shown to have therapeutic potential in wound healing, and antimicrobial activity and be antiproliferative against several cancer models such as human osteosarcoma (HOS), human breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines. To date, there was limited study on antileukemic properties of Tualang (Koompassia excelsa) Honey. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antileukemic effect of Tualang Honey on acute and chronic leukemia cell lines. Leukemia cell lines (K562 and MV4-11) and human mononuclear cell isolated from peripheral blood were grown in RPM1 1640 culture medium. The cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Tualang Honey. After incubation, the evaluation of viability and apoptosis was performed. The morphological changes of leukemia cells were the presence of cytoplasmic blebs followed by apoptotic bodies and round shape of cells. IC50 against K562 and MV4-11 was determined. Tualang Honey gave 53.9% and 50.6% apoptosis activity on K562 and MV4-11, respectively, while on human mononuclear cell it was 37.4%.

We demonstrate that the percentages of population-shared and population-specific cis-eQTLs are comparable; while indel cis-eQTLs in the population-specific subsection make more contribution to gene expression variations than those in the population-shared subsection. We found cis-eQTLs, especially the population-shared cis-eQTLs are significantly enriched toward transcription start site. Moreover, the National Human Genome Research Institute cataloged GWAS SNPs are enriched for LCL cis-eQTLs. Specifically, 32.8% GWAS SNPs are LCL cis-eQTLs, among which 12.5% can be tagged by indel cis-eQTLs, suggesting the fundamental contribution of indel cis-eQTLs to GWAS association signals. To search for functional indels and SNPs tagging GWAS SNPs, a pipeline Post-GWAS Explorer for Functional Indels and SNPs (PExFInS) has been developed, integrating LD analysis, functional annotation from public databases, cis-eQTL mapping with our LCL cis-eQTL database and other published cis-eQTL datasets.","['Cheng, Zhongshan', 'Chu, Hin', 'Fan, Yanhui', 'Li, Cun', 'Song, You-Qiang', 'Zhou, Jie', 'Yuen, Kwok-Yung']","['Cheng Z', 'Chu H', 'Fan Y', 'Li C', 'Song YQ', 'Zhou J', 'Yuen KY']","['Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Center for Genomic Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.', 'Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151127,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*INDEL Mutation', 'Leukemia/ethnology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics/pathology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Racial Groups', '*Software', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",2015/11/28 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['srep17302 [pii]', '10.1038/srep17302 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Nov 27;5:17302. doi: 10.1038/srep17302.,,PMC4661514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Global coagulation tests were normal in all patients, as were antithrombin and protein S. Activated protein C resistance caused by the factor V Leiden mutation was found in four patients, one patient had the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene, and one patient had protein C deficiency. The most striking findings were sustained very high levels of factor VIII (>150 %) in 30 patients (68 %), which correlated with high von Willebrand factor. An acute phase response in these patients was ruled out by absence of fever and normal IL-6 and -alpha. Elevated factor VIII is an independent thrombophilic risk factor and may play an etiologic role in thromboembolic complications in patients with malignant lymphoma. Since high von Willebrand factor is most likely caused by endothelial cell injury, an additional, unknown pathophysiological association with malignant lymphoma and acute leukemia is possible.","['Mohren, Martin', 'Jentsch-Ullrich, Kathleen', 'Koenigsmann, Michael', 'Kropf, Siegfried', 'Schalk, Enrico', 'Lutze, Gerd']","['Mohren M', 'Jentsch-Ullrich K', 'Koenigsmann M', 'Kropf S', 'Schalk E', 'Lutze G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Magdeburg University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany. martin.mohren@JKSDL.de.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie/Onkologie, Johanniter-Krankenhaus Stendal, Wendstr. 31, 39576, Stendal, Germany. martin.mohren@JKSDL.de.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Magdeburg University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Magdeburg University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Magdeburg University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Magdeburg University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Magdeburg University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151126,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (factor V Leiden)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)', '9001-26-7 (Prothrombin)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Factor V/genetics', 'Factor VIII/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*blood/complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prothrombin/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*blood/*etiology', 'von Willebrand Factor/*analysis']",2015/11/28 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1913-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1913-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Feb;103(2):189-95. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1913-y.

This anthracycline antibiotic serves as an effective anti-neoplastic drug against both hematological and solid malignancies. Here, we set out to assess the capacity of a novel doxorubicin - transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) to provoke apoptosis in human normal and leukemia cells through free radicals produced via a redox cycle of doxorubicin (DOX) when released from its conjugate. METHODS: After DOX-TRF exposure, we determined the time-course of apoptotic and necrotic events, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as alterations in cytochrome c levels and intracellular calcium concentrations in human leukemia-derived cell lines (CCRF-CEM, K562 and its doxorubicin-resistant derivative K562/DOX) and normal peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: We found that DOX-TRF can induce apoptosis in all leukemia-derived cell lines tested, which was associated with morphological changes and decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential. In comparison to free DOX treated cells, we observed a time-dependency between a higher level of ROS generation and a higher drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, particularly in the doxorubicin-resistant cell line. In addition, we found that the apoptotic cell death induced by DOX-TRF was directly associated with a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and an increase in intracellular calcium level in all human leukemia-derived cell lines tested. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that DOX-TRF is considerably more cytotoxic to human leukemia cells than free DOX. In addition, we show that DOX-TRF can effectively produce free radicals, which are directly involved in apoptosis induction.","['Szwed, Marzena', 'Laroche-Clary, Audrey', 'Robert, Jacques', 'Jozwiak, Zofia']","['Szwed M', 'Laroche-Clary A', 'Robert J', 'Jozwiak Z']","['Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236, Lodz, Poland. szwedmesia@tlen.pl.', 'INSERM U916, Institut Bergonie, Universite de Bordeaux, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U916, Institut Bergonie, Universite de Bordeaux, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (doxorubicin-transferrin conjugate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/28 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13402-015-0256-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-015-0256-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2016 Apr;39(2):107-18. doi: 10.1007/s13402-015-0256-2.

Some of the predictors exhibit time-dependent effects. We present a systematic analysis and description of selected clinical predictors influencing outcome in a time-dependent manner based on an analysis of registry data from the German Registry for Stem Cell Transplantation. A total of 14,951 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoma transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow grafts were included. Multivariate Cox regression models were tested for time-dependent effects within each diagnosis group. Predictors not satisfying the proportional hazards assumption were modeled in a time-dependent manner, extending the Cox regression models. Similar patterns occurred in all diagnosis groups. Patients with a poor Karnofsky performance score (<80) had a high risk for early mortality until day 139 following transplantation (HR 2.42, CI: 2.19-2.68; P<0.001) compared to patients with a good Karnofsky performance score (80-100). Afterwards the risk reduced to HR 1.43, CI: 1.25-1.63; P<0.001. A lower mortality risk was found for patients after conditioning treatment with reduced intensity until day 120 post transplant (HR: 0.81 CI: 0.75-0.88; P<0.001). After this, a slightly higher risk could be shown for these patients. Similarly, patients who had received a PBSC graft exhibited a significantly lower mortality risk until day 388 post transplantation (HR 0.79, CI: 0.73-0.85; P<0.001), reversing to a significantly higher risk afterwards (HR 1.23, CI: 1.08-1.40; P=0.002). Integrating time dependency in regression models allows a more accurate description and quantification of clinical predictors to be made, which may help in risk assessment and patient counseling.","['Fuerst, Daniel', 'Mueller, Carlheinz', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Neuchel, Christine', 'Tsamadou, Chrysanthi', 'Schrezenmeier, Hubert', 'Mytilineos, Joannis']","['Fuerst D', 'Mueller C', 'Beelen DW', 'Neuchel C', 'Tsamadou C', 'Schrezenmeier H', 'Mytilineos J']","['Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden-Wuerttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, Germany Institute of Transfusion Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany d.fuerst@blutspende.de.', 'DRST - German Registry for Stem Cell Transplantation, Ulm Office, Ulm, Germany Zentrales Knochenmarkspender-Register Deutschland (ZKRD), Ulm, Germany.', 'DRST - German Registry for Stem Cell Transplantation, Essen Office, Essen, Germany Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden-Wuerttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, Germany Institute of Transfusion Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden-Wuerttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, Germany Institute of Transfusion Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden-Wuerttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, Germany Institute of Transfusion Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Baden-Wuerttemberg - Hessen, Ulm, Germany Institute of Transfusion Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany DRST - German Registry for Stem Cell Transplantation, Ulm Office, Ulm, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151126,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",2015/11/28 06:00,2017/01/05 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.130401 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.130401 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Feb;101(2):241-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.130401.

However, its in-vivo role during normal human B lymphopoiesis is unknown. Genetic alterations that cause overexpression of its receptor component, cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2), lead to high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia implicating this signaling pathway in leukemogenesis. We show that mouse thymic stromal lymphopoietin does not stimulate the downstream pathways (JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) activated by the human cytokine in primary high-risk leukemia with overexpression of the receptor component. Thus, the utility of classic patient-derived xenografts for in-vivo studies of this pathway is limited. We engineered xenograft mice to produce human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (+T mice) by injection with stromal cells transduced to express the cytokine. Control (-T) mice were produced using stroma transduced with control vector. Normal levels of human thymic stromal lymphopoietin were achieved in sera of +T mice, but were undetectable in -T mice. Patient-derived xenografts generated from +T as compared to -T mice showed a 3-6-fold increase in normal human B-cell precursors that was maintained through later stages of B-cell development. Gene expression profiles in high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia expanded in +T mice indicate increased mTOR pathway activation and are more similar to the original patient sample than those from -T mice. +T/-T xenografts provide a novel pre-clinical model for understanding this pathway in B lymphopoiesis and identifying treatments for high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with overexpression of cytokine-like factor receptor 2.","['Francis, Olivia L', 'Milford, Terry-Ann M', 'Martinez, Shannalee R', 'Baez, Ineavely', 'Coats, Jacqueline S', 'Mayagoitia, Karina', 'Concepcion, Katherine R', 'Ginelli, Elizabeth', 'Beldiman, Cornelia', 'Benitez, Abigail', 'Weldon, Abby J', 'Arogyaswamy, Keshav', 'Shiraz, Parveen', 'Fisher, Ross', 'Morris, Christopher L', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Filippov, Valeri', 'Van Handel, Ben', 'Ge, Zheng', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Su, Ruijun Jeanna', 'Payne, Kimberly J']","['Francis OL', 'Milford TA', 'Martinez SR', 'Baez I', 'Coats JS', 'Mayagoitia K', 'Concepcion KR', 'Ginelli E', 'Beldiman C', 'Benitez A', 'Weldon AJ', 'Arogyaswamy K', 'Shiraz P', 'Fisher R', 'Morris CL', 'Zhang XB', 'Filippov V', 'Van Handel B', 'Ge Z', 'Song C', 'Dovat S', 'Su RJ', 'Payne KJ']","['Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Novogenix Laboratories, LLC, 1425 San Pablo, CA, USA.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Department of Hematology, Nanjing 210029, China Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Department of Pediatrics, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Department of Pediatrics, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Department of Pediatrics, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University, CA, USA kpayne@llu.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heterografts/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2015/11/28 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2015/11/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.125336 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.125336 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Apr;101(4):417-26. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.125336.

Early allogeneic stem cell transplant can confer durable remission. As novel therapeutic agents become available to treat T cell malignancies, it is increasingly important that medical oncologists, hematologists, and hematopathologists recognize and accurately diagnose adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma. There is no uniform standard of treatment of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, and clinical trials remain critical to improving outcomes.

Our nationwide Finnish registry study investigated the purchases of cardiovascular medication from 1993 to 2011 in patients diagnosed with cancer aged below 35 years (N = 8,197) between 1993 and 2004 compared to siblings (N = 29,974) via linkage to the drug purchase registry. The cumulative incidence for purchasing cardiovascular medications was higher in childhood and YA cancer patients compared to siblings with a rising trend over time. After childhood cancer, the highest hazard ratio (HR) was found for purchasing anticoagulants (HR 19.8, 95% CI 8.5-45.9). The HRs for any cardiovascular medication (HR 7.2, 95% CI 5.1-10.1) and cardiac medication (HR 4.8, 95% CI 3.3-6.9) were markedly elevated after childhood cancer as well. Regarding YA cancer patients, the respective HRs were 2.5 (95% CI 2.0-3.2) for anticoagulants, HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.5-1.9) for any cardiovascular medication and HR 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7) for cardiac medication. Among cancer patients, highest HRs for cardiovascular medication were observed after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and bone tumors (HR 10.2, 95% CI 6.8-15.5 and HR 7.4, 95% CI 4.0-13.7) and YA ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (HR 5.1, 95% CI 3.5-7.1 and HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.8-4.0). Our study demonstrated increased HRs for purchasing cardiovascular medication after early-onset cancer compared to siblings reflecting elevated cardiovascular morbidity.

Pro-apoptotic members of this family, known as BH3-only proteins, initiate activation of the effectors Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), which is counteracted by anti-apoptotic family members. How the interactions of Bcl-2 proteins regulate cell death is still not entirely clear. Here, we show that in the absence of extrinsic apoptotic stimuli Bak activates without detectable contribution from BH3-only proteins, and cell survival depends on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules. All anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins were targeted via RNA interference alone or in combinations of two in primary human fibroblasts. Simultaneous targeting of B-cell lymphoma-extra large and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 led to apoptosis in several cell types. Apoptosis depended on Bak whereas Bax was dispensable. Activator BH3-only proteins were not required for apoptosis induction as apoptosis was unaltered in the absence of all BH3-only proteins known to activate Bax or Bak directly, Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death, BH3-interacting domain death agonist and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis. These findings argue for auto-activation of Bak in the absence of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and provide evidence of profound differences in the activation of Bax and Bak.","['Senft, D', 'Weber, A', 'Saathoff, F', 'Berking, C', 'Heppt, M V', 'Kammerbauer, C', 'Rothenfusser, S', 'Kellner, S', 'Kurgyis, Z', 'Besch, R', 'Hacker, G']","['Senft D', 'Weber A', 'Saathoff F', 'Berking C', 'Heppt MV', 'Kammerbauer C', 'Rothenfusser S', 'Kellner S', 'Kurgyis Z', 'Besch R', 'Hacker G']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Center of Integrated Protein Science CIPS-M, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Center of Integrated Protein Science CIPS-M, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Section of Gastroenterology and Endocrinology, Medizinische Klinik Innenstadt, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University of Szeged, 6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, 80337 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RTL10 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/ultrastructure', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*deficiency/metabolism']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/09/15 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2015341 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.341 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Nov 26;6:e1996. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.341.,,PMC4670944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the modulation of nuclear inositides in hematological malignancies can differentially affect erythropoiesis or myelopoiesis. This is particularly important in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), who show both defective erythroid and myeloid differentiation, as well as an increased risk of evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the structure and function of specific nuclear inositide enzymes, whose impairment could be linked with disease pathogenesis and cancer. The authors, stemming from literature and published data, discuss and describe the role of nuclear inositides, focusing on specific enzymes and demonstrating that targeting these molecules could be important to develop innovative therapeutic approaches, with particular reference to MDS treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Demethylating therapy, alone or in combination with other drugs, is the most common and current therapy for MDS patients. Nuclear inositide signaling molecules have been demonstrated to be important in hematopoietic differentiation and are promising new targets for developing a personalized MDS therapy. Indeed, these enzymes can be ideal targets for drug design and their modulation can have several important downstream effects to regulate MDS pathogenesis and prevent MDS progression to AML.","['Mongiorgi, Sara', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Yang, Yong Ryoul', 'Clissa, Cristina', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Suh, Pann-Ghill', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Follo, Matilde Y']","['Mongiorgi S', 'Finelli C', 'Yang YR', 'Clissa C', 'McCubrey JA', 'Billi AM', 'Manzoli L', 'Suh PG', 'Cocco L', 'Follo MY']","['a Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Institute of Human Anatomy, Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy.', 'b Institute of Hematology ""L e A Seragnoli"" , S.

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of MC on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats and to explore its possible mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered MC extract (1.98 g/kg, i.g.) for 14 days and underwent a subsequent open-chest procedure involving 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. The cardioprotective effect of MC was demonstrated by reduced infarct size and marked improvement in the histopathological examination. The increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) as well as the reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) indicated that MC effectively promoted the anti-oxidative defense system. Increased anti-oxidative defense was accompanied by decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). The reduction in TUNEL-positive myocytes demonstrated that MC decreased myocardial apoptosis. The mRNA expression of B cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) was upregulated by MC and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) mRNA expression was increased. MC pretreatment decreased the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The data from this study suggest that MC exerted protective effects on acute myocardial I/R injury via anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities.","['Dan, Hong', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Qin, Xiaolin', 'Peng, Xiaohui', 'Wong, Mingyan', 'Tan, Xuan', 'Yu, Shanggong', 'Fang, Nianbai']","['Dan H', 'Zhang L', 'Qin X', 'Peng X', 'Wong M', 'Tan X', 'Yu S', 'Fang N']","['a Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription (Hubei University of Chinese Medicine), Ministry of Education, 1 Huang-jia-hu, Wuhan, China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription (Hubei University of Chinese Medicine), Ministry of Education, 1 Huang-jia-hu, Wuhan, China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription (Hubei University of Chinese Medicine), Ministry of Education, 1 Huang-jia-hu, Wuhan, China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription (Hubei University of Chinese Medicine), Ministry of Education, 1 Huang-jia-hu, Wuhan, China.', 'a Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription (Hubei University of Chinese Medicine), Ministry of Education, 1 Huang-jia-hu, Wuhan, China.', 'b Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, China.', ""c Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA."", ""c Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA."", 'd Departments of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150807,Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (moutan cortex)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Creatine Kinase/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Paeonia', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1139/cjpp-2015-0168 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 2016 Mar;94(3):245-50. doi: 10.1139/cjpp-2015-0168.

Rituximab is a chimeric therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the protein CD20, allowing it to destroy B cells and to treat lymphoma, leukemia, transplant rejection, and autoimmune disorder. In this work, the binding of rituximab to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of peptide mimotopes of CD20 antigen was systematically characterized. Four peptide mimotopes of CD 20 antigen were selected from the literature and redesigned to allow their SAM immobilizations on gold electrodes through a peptide linker with cysteine. The bindings of these peptides with rituximab and control mAbs (trastuzumab and bevacizumab) were characterized by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Among the four peptide mimotopes initially selected, the peptide designated as CN-14 (CGSGSGSWPRWLEN) was the most selective and sensitive for rituximab binding. The CN-14 SAM was further characterized by ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The thickness of the CN-14 SAM film was approximately 32 A, and the CN-14 SAM is suggested to be stabilized by a salt bridge of Arg-10 and Glu-13 between CN-14 peptides. The CN-14 salt bridge was evaluated by a series of modifications to the CN-14 peptide sequence and characterized by QCM. The CN-14 amide variant produced a better affinity to rituximab than CN-14 without a significant impact on selectivity. As the pKa of the Glu residue of CN-14 increased, the affinity of the SAM to rituximab increased, whereas the selectivity decreased. This was attributed to the weakening of the salt bridge between the CN-14 Arg-10 and Glu-13 at higher pKa values for Glu-13. Our study shows that peptide mimotopes have potential benefits in sensor applications, as the peptide-peptide interactions in the SAMs can be manipulated by the addition of functional groups to the peptide to influence the binding of target proteins.","['Leo, Norman', 'Shang, Yuqin', 'Yu, Jing-jiang', 'Zeng, Xiangqun']","['Leo N', 'Shang Y', 'Yu JJ', 'Zeng X']","['Chemistry Department, Oakland University , Rochester, Michigan 48309, United States.', 'Chemistry Department, Oakland University , Rochester, Michigan 48309, United States.', 'Nanotechnology Measurements Division, Agilent Technologies, Inc. , Chandler, Arizona 85226, United States.', 'Nanotechnology Systems Division, Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc. , Clarksburg, Maryland 20871, United States.', 'Chemistry Department, Oakland University , Rochester, Michigan 48309, United States.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151214,United States,Langmuir,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,9882736,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD20/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Biomimetics', 'Gold/chemistry', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Rituximab/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Surface Properties']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b02605 [doi]'],ppublish,Langmuir. 2015 Dec 29;31(51):13764-72. doi: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b02605.

The aim of this study was to determine these associations using meta-analytical methods. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to examine the associations between XRCC1 Arg399-Gln SNP and leukemia risk. A literature search of PubMed and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to March 10, 2015. The references of the retrieved articles were also screened. All the statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager software. RESULTS: The XRCC1 Arg399Gln SNP was found to be associated with increased childhood risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia among Asians under the dominant (odds ratio [OR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-2.97, P<0.0001), allele contrast (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.33-2.23, P<0.0001), and homozygote contrast (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.25-4.36, P=0.008) models. However, no association was found in Caucasians between the SNP and risk of either chronic myeloid leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia under any contrast model. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current meta-analysis indicate that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln SNP is a risk factor for childhood lymphoblastic leukemia in Asians.","['Wang, Fang', 'Zhao, Qian', 'He, Hai-Rong', 'Zhai, Ya-Jing', 'Lu, Jun', 'Hu, Hai-Bo', 'Zhou, Jin-Song', 'Yang, Yong-Hua', 'Li, Yuan-Jie']","['Wang F', 'Zhao Q', 'He HR', 'Zhai YJ', 'Lu J', 'Hu HB', 'Zhou JS', 'Yang YH', 'Li YJ']","[""Department of Human Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Centre, Xi'an, People's Republic of China ; College of Pharmacy, Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Human Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Centre, Xi'an, People's Republic of China ; College of Pharmacy, Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Research Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Research Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Human Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Centre, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Human Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Centre, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Human Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Centre, Xi'an, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151106,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2015/11/27 06:00,2015/11/27 06:01,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S92752 [doi]', 'ott-8-3277 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2015 Nov 6;8:3277-87. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S92752. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4644162,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'Arg399Gln', 'CLL', 'CML', 'susceptibility']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a characteristic morphology and immunophenotypic profile. It is important to distinguish HCL from other B cell lymphoproliferative disorders due to availability of different chemotherapeutic agents. This study presents clinical, haematological and immunophenotypic profile of patients with HCL seen over a period of four years in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: Twenty one cases of hairy cell leukaemia were analyzed for their clinical details, haemogram, bone marrow examination and immunophenotypic findings. RESULTS: Age of the patients ranged from 28-76 yr with male predominance. Weakness and fever were commonest presentations. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy were seen in decreasing order of frequency. Anaemia was noted in all 21 patients, leukopenia in 15 and thrombocytopenia in 19 cases. Fourteen patients were pancytopenic. Bone marrow examination showed typical hairy cells in all cases. Immunophenotyping showed expression of CD19, CD20, CD103, CD25 and CD11c in all cases, while positivity was seen for CD79b in 93.7 per cent, kappa light chain restriction in 60 per cent and lambda in 40 per cent cases. Notably, 20 per cent showed CD10 and 12 per cent showed CD23 expression.

We assessed the incidence and case-fatality of VZV infection at three institutions in developing countries (Argentina, Mexico, and Nicaragua). Individuals eligible for our study were aged <20 years and actively receiving cancer-directed therapy. We estimated a summary incidence rate (IR) and case-fatality risk with corresponding 95 % confidence limits (CL) of VZV infection across sites using random-effects models. Our study population comprised 511 pediatric cancer patients, of whom 64 % were aged <10 years, 58 % were male, and 58 % were diagnosed with leukemia. We observed a total of 10 infections during 44,401 person-days of follow-up across the 3 sites (IR = 2.3, 95 % CL 1.2, 4.2). The summary case-fatality risk was 10 % (95 % CL 1.4, 47 %) based on one death. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest low incidence and case-fatality of VZV infections among pediatric cancer patients in three developing countries. VZV vaccine recommendations for pediatric cancer patients in developed countries may be generalizable to developing countries. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Current recommendations, based on evidence from pediatric cancer patients in developed countries, contraindicate varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination until completion of cancer-directed therapy and recovery of immune function. * The generalizability of these VZV vaccine recommendations to pediatric cancer patients in developing countries is unknown because of limited information about the incidence and case-fatality of VZV in these settings. What is New: * Our results suggest low incidence and case-fatality of VZV infections among pediatric cancer patients in three developing countries. * VZV vaccine recommendations based on evidence from pediatric cancer patients in developed countries may be generalizable to pediatric cancer patients in developing countries.","['Ojha, Rohit P', 'Stallings-Smith, Sericea', 'Aviles-Robles, Martha J', 'Gomez, Sergio', 'Somarriba, Maria Mercedes', 'Caniza, Miguela A']","['Ojha RP', 'Stallings-Smith S', 'Aviles-Robles MJ', 'Gomez S', 'Somarriba MM', 'Caniza MA']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MS 735, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. rohit.ojha@stjude.org."", 'Department of Public Health, Brooks College of Health, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Ninos Sor Maria Ludovica, La Plata, Argentina.', 'Infection Control Committee, Hospital Infantil Manuel de Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""International Outreach Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Chickenpox/complications/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/complications/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Herpesvirus 3, Human', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Nicaragua/epidemiology', 'Pediatrics', 'Risk Factors']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/12/24 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00431-015-2672-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00431-015-2672-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2016 Apr;175(4):581-5. doi: 10.1007/s00431-015-2672-8.

In approximately 20% of the pediatric AML cases a specific genetic aberration is still unknown. Minimally differentiated myeloid leukemia or FAB-type M0 is a rare morphological subtype of AML. The translocation t(10;17)(p15;q21) is described to be recurrent in minimally differentiated AML, but the involved genes and location of the breakpoints have so far not been identified. In this study, we show that this translocation results in an in-frame translocation fusing exon 12 of the tumor suppressor gene ZMYND11 to exon 3 of the chromatin protein MBTD1, encoding a protein of 1,054 amino acids, while the reciprocal fusion product is predicted to lack a productive start codon. Gene expression profiling of the leukemic cells showed high HOXA expression. ZMYND11, also known as BS69, is a tumor suppressor that specifically recognizes H3K36me3, which is linked to aberrant HOXA expression in leukemogenesis. Aberrant expression of the genes involved in this fusion may thus contribute to the HOXA-phenotype observed with gene expression profiling.","['de Rooij, Jasmijn D E', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Kollen, Wouter J W', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Fornerod, Maarten', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Zwaan, C Michel']","['de Rooij JD', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Kollen WJ', 'Sonneveld E', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Beverloo HB', 'Fornerod M', 'Pieters R', 'Zwaan CM']","[""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Immunology, Hemato-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, the Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Genetics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Working Group on Hemato-Oncologic Genome Diagnostics, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MBTD1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (ZMYND11 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22326 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2016 Mar;55(3):237-41. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22326.

AML cells are not susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs because of their multidrug resistance (MDR). Antitubulin agents are currently employed in cancer treatments; however, drug resistance results in treatment failures because of MDR1 expressing cancer cells. We previously synthesized a new tubulin inhibitor, 2-dimethylamino-N-[1-(4-methoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-7-yl]-aceta mide (MPT0B169), which inhibits AML cell proliferation by arresting cell cycle at the G2/M phase. In this study, we explored the effect of MPT0B169 on apoptosis in AML HL60 and NB4 cells and MDR1-mediated taxol-resistant HL60/TaxR cells and the underlying mechanism. MPT0B169 induced concentration- and time-dependent apoptosis in these cancer cells, as observed through annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and flow cytometry. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation analysis confirmed MPT0B169-induced apoptosis. MPT0B169 induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, cleavage and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and consequently cleavage of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase. Western blot analysis showed that MPT0B169 markedly reduced Mcl-1 (an antiapoptotic protein) levels; however, it caused no changes in Bcl-2 or BAX (a proapoptotic protein). Knockdown of Mcl-1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) slightly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in the HL60 and HL60/TaxR cells. Further investigation revealed that Mcl-1 siRNA enhanced the sensitivity of HL60 and HL60/TaxR cells to MPT0B169-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Together, these results demonstrated that MPT0B169-induced apoptosis in nonresistant and MDR1-mediated taxol-resistant AML cells through Mcl-1 downregulation and a mitochondria-mediated pathway. MPT0B169 can overcome MDR1-mediated drug resistance in AML cells.","['Wang, Che-Chuan', 'Liu, Hsinjin Eugene', 'Lee, Yueh-Lun', 'Huang, Yu-Wen', 'Chen, Yi-Ju', 'Liou, Jing-Ping', 'Huang, Huei-Mei']","['Wang CC', 'Liu HE', 'Lee YL', 'Huang YW', 'Chen YJ', 'Liou JP', 'Huang HM']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Chi-Mei Medical Center, No. 901, Zhonghua Rd., Tainan, 710, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wuxing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wuxing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wuxing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wuxing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wuxing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan. jpl@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wuxing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan. cmbhhm@tmu.edu.tw.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151125,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0', '(2-dimethylamino-N-(1-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-7-yl)acetam', 'ide)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Z711V88R5F (Sarcosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Sarcosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology']",2015/11/27 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4380-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4380-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 May;37(5):6065-72. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4380-4.

Despite the antiviral activity, several nuclear replicating DNA viruses use the domains as deposition sites for the incoming viral genomes and/or as sites for viral DNA replication, suggesting that PML-NBs are functionally relevant during early viral infection to establish productive replication. Although PML-NBs and their components have also been implicated in the adenoviral life cycle, it remains unclear whether incoming adenoviral genome complexes target PML-NBs. Here we show using immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging analyses that incoming adenovirus genome complexes neither localize at nor recruit components of PML-NBs during early phases of infection. We further show that the viral DNA binding protein (DBP), an early expressed viral gene and essential DNA replication factor, independently targets PML-NBs. We show that DBP oligomerization is required to selectively recruit the PML-NB components Sp100 and USP7. Depletion experiments suggest that the absence of one PML-NB component might not affect the recruitment of other components toward DBP oligomers. Thus, our findings suggest a model in which an adenoviral DNA replication factor, but not incoming viral genome complexes, targets and modulates PML-NBs to support a conducive state for viral DNA replication and argue against a generalized concept that PML-NBs target incoming viral genomes. IMPORTANCE: The immediate fate upon nuclear delivery of genomes of incoming DNA viruses is largely unclear. Early reports suggested that incoming genomes of herpesviruses are targeted and repressed by PML-NBs immediately upon nuclear import. Genome localization and/or viral DNA replication has also been observed at PML-NBs for other DNA viruses. Thus, it was suggested that PML-NBs may immediately sense and target nuclear viral genomes and hence serve as sites for deposition of incoming viral genomes and/or subsequent viral DNA replication. Here we performed a detailed analyses of the spatiotemporal distribution of incoming adenoviral genome complexes and found, in contrast to the expectation, that an adenoviral DNA replication factor, but not incoming genomes, targets PML-NBs. Thus, our findings may explain why adenoviral genomes could be observed at PML-NBs in earlier reports but argue against a generalized role for PML-NBs in targeting invading viral genomes.","['Komatsu, Tetsuro', 'Nagata, Kyosuke', 'Wodrich, Harald']","['Komatsu T', 'Nagata K', 'Wodrich H']","['Microbiologie Fondamentale et Pathogenicite, MFP CNRS UMR 5234, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Microbiologie Fondamentale et Pathogenicite, MFP CNRS UMR 5234, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France harald.wodrich@u-bordeaux.fr.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DBP protein, Adenovirus)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*physiology', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Macromolecular Substances/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Optical Imaging', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02545-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02545-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2015 Nov 25;90(3):1657-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02545-15.

The apelin receptor has previously been shown to function as a coreceptor for HIV-1, and thus, adaptation of the viral vector to this receptor is of significant interest. Here, we report the molecular evolution of the SL3-AP envelope protein when the virus is cultured in cells harboring either the Xpr1 or the hAPJ receptor. Interestingly, the dual receptor affinity is maintained even after 10 passages in these cells. At the same time, the chimeric viral envelope protein evolves in a distinct pattern in the apelin cassette when passaged on D17 cells expressing hAPJ in three separate molecular evolution studies. This pattern reflects selection for reduced ligand-receptor interaction and is compatible with a model in which SL3-AP has evolved not to activate hAPJ receptor internalization. IMPORTANCE: Few successful examples of engineered retargeting of a retroviral vector exist. The engineered SL3-AP envelope is capable of utilizing either the murine Xpr1 or the human APJ receptor for entry. In addition, SL3-AP is the first example of an engineered retrovirus retaining its dual tropism after several rounds of passaging on cells expressing only one of its receptors. We demonstrate that the virus evolves toward reduced ligand-receptor affinity, which sheds new light on virus adaptation. We provide indirect evidence that such reduced affinity leads to reduced receptor internalization and propose a novel model in which too rapid receptor internalization may decrease virus entry.","['Friis, Kristina Pagh', 'Iturrioz, Xavier', 'Thomsen, Jonas', 'Alvear-Perez, Rodrigo', 'Bahrami, Shervin', 'Llorens-Cortes, Catherine', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Friis KP', 'Iturrioz X', 'Thomsen J', 'Alvear-Perez R', 'Bahrami S', 'Llorens-Cortes C', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark Laboratory of Central Neuropeptides in the Regulation of Body Fluid Homeostasis and Cardiovascular Functions, INSERM U1050, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Central Neuropeptides in the Regulation of Body Fluid Homeostasis and Cardiovascular Functions, INSERM U1050, Paris, France Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, Paris, France CNRS, UMR 7241, Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Laboratory of Central Neuropeptides in the Regulation of Body Fluid Homeostasis and Cardiovascular Functions, INSERM U1050, Paris, France Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, Paris, France CNRS, UMR 7241, Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark SKAUvaccines, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Laboratory of Central Neuropeptides in the Regulation of Body Fluid Homeostasis and Cardiovascular Functions, INSERM U1050, Paris, France Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB), College de France, Paris, France CNRS, UMR 7241, Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark fsp@mb.au.dk.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (APLNR protein, human)', '0 (Apelin Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apelin Receptors', 'Cell Line', '*Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*physiology', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Viral Tropism', '*Virus Internalization', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02013-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02013-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2015 Nov 25;90(3):1647-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02013-15.

All three monocyte subsets sorted from HTLV-1-infected individuals were positive for viral DNA, and the frequency of classical monocytes was lower in the blood of HTLV-1-infected individuals than in that of uninfected individuals, while the expression levels of the chemokine receptors CCR5, CXCR3, and CX3CR1 in classical monocytes were higher in HTLV-1-infected individuals than uninfected individuals; the percentage of intermediate monocytes and their levels of chemokine receptor expression did not differ between HTLV-1-infected and uninfected individuals. However, the capacity of intermediate monocytes to migrate to CCL5, the ligand for CCR5, was higher, and a higher proportion of nonclassical monocytes expressed CCR1, CXCR3, and CX3CR1. The level of viral DNA in the monocyte subsets correlated with the capacity to migrate to CCL2, CCL5, and CX3CL1 for classical monocytes, with lower levels of phagocytosis for intermediate monocytes, and with the level of viral DNA in CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells for nonclassical monocytes. These data suggest a model whereby HTLV-1 infection augments the number of classical monocytes that migrate to tissues and become infected and the number of infected nonclassical monocytes that transmit virus to CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These results, together with prior findings in a macaque model of HTLV-1 infection, support the notion that infection of monocytes by HTLV-1 is likely a requisite for viral persistence in humans. IMPORTANCE: Monocytes have been implicated in immune regulation and disease progression in patients with HTLV-1-associated inflammatory diseases. We detected HTLV-1 DNA in all three monocyte subsets and found that infection impacts surface receptor expression, migratory function, and subset frequency. The frequency of nonclassical patrolling monocytes is increased in HTLV-1-infected individuals, and they have increased expression of CCR1, CXCR3, and CX3CR1. The viral DNA level in nonclassical monocytes correlated with the viral DNA level in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Altogether, these data suggest an increased recruitment of classical monocytes to inflammation sites that may result in virus acquisition and, in turn, facilitate virus dissemination and viral persistence. Our findings thus provide new insight into the importance of monocyte infection in viral spread and suggest targeting of monocytes for therapeutic intervention.","['de Castro-Amarante, Maria Fernanda', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'McKinnon, Katherine', 'Washington Parks, Robyn', 'Galli, Veronica', 'Omsland, Maria', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Massoud, Raya', 'Brunetto, Giovanna', 'Caruso, Breanna', 'Venzon, David', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['de Castro-Amarante MF', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'McKinnon K', 'Washington Parks R', 'Galli V', 'Omsland M', 'Andresen V', 'Massoud R', 'Brunetto G', 'Caruso B', 'Venzon D', 'Jacobson S', 'Franchini G']","['Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA masisonc@mail.nih.gov franchig@mail.nih.gov.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, Translational Hemato-Oncology Group, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, Translational Hemato-Oncology Group, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Data Management Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA masisonc@mail.nih.gov franchig@mail.nih.gov.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20151125,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, CCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/isolation & purification', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/chemistry/*virology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptors, CCR/analysis', 'Receptors, CXCR/analysis', '*Viral Load']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/06/22 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02735-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02735-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2015 Nov 25;90(5):2195-207. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02735-15.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4810698,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression could affect normal hematopoiesis, leading to the development of hematological malignancies. Hematologic cancers, which are caused by malignant transformation of cells of the bone marrow and the lymphatic system, are usually divided into three major groups: leukemias, lymphomas, and monoclonal gammopathies. Hematologic malignancies are highly aggressive diseases with high morbidity and mortality. For these reasons, early and easily obtainable markers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and follow-up are essential for improvement of outcome and survival of these patients. Recent studies have provided new insights about the diagnostic value of expression patterns of miRNAs in serum/plasma in these diseases. While the use of circulating miRNAs is only at the experimental level, it appears to have a great potential. This chapter deals with the use of circulating miRNAs as minimally invasive biomarkers in hematologic malignancies.","['Stankova, Monika', 'Kubaczkova, Veronika', 'Sedlarikova, Lenka', 'Sevcikova, Sabina']","['Stankova M', 'Kubaczkova V', 'Sedlarikova L', 'Sevcikova S']","['Babak Myeloma Group, Department of Pathological Physiology, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Babak Myeloma Group, Department of Pathological Physiology, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Babak Myeloma Group, Department of Pathological Physiology, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic.', 'Babak Myeloma Group, Department of Pathological Physiology, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, Brno, 625 00, Czech Republic. sevcik@med.muni.cz.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Exp Suppl,Experientia supplementum (2012),101738007,,IM,,2015/11/27 06:00,2015/11/27 06:01,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-0348-0955-9_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Suppl. 2015;106:123-138. doi: 10.1007/978-3-0348-0955-9_5.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Circulating microRNA', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'MDS', 'Multiple myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identify ROBO1 and ROBO2 as novel progression-related somatic mutations using whole-exome and targeted sequencing in 6 of 16 (37.5%) paired MDS patients with disease progression. Further deep sequencing detects 20 (10.4%) patients with ROBO mutations in a cohort of 193 MDS patients. In addition, copy number loss and loss of heterogeneity (LOH) of ROBO1 and ROBO2 are frequently observed in patients with progression or carrying ROBO mutations. In in vitro experiments, overexpression of ROBO1 or ROBO2 produces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in leukaemia cells. However, this effect was lost in ROBO mutants and ROBO-SLIT2 signalling is impaired. Multivariate analysis shows that ROBO mutations are independent factors for predicting poor survival. These findings demonstrate a novel contribution of ROBO mutations to the pathogenesis of MDS and highlight a key role for ROBO-SLIT2 signalling in MDS disease progression.","['Xu, Feng', 'Wu, Ling-Yun', 'Chang, Chun-Kang', 'He, Qi', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Liu, Li', 'Shi, Wen-Hui', 'Guo, Juan', 'Zhu, Yang', 'Zhao, You-Shan', 'Gu, Shu-Cheng', 'Fei, Cheng-Ming', 'Wu, Dong', 'Zhou, Li-Yu', 'Su, Ji-Ying', 'Song, Lu-Xi', 'Xiao, Chao', 'Li, Xiao']","['Xu F', 'Wu LY', 'Chang CK', 'He Q', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu L', 'Shi WH', 'Guo J', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhao YS', 'Gu SC', 'Fei CM', 'Wu D', 'Zhou LY', 'Su JY', 'Song LX', 'Xiao C', 'Li X']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai 200233, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (ROBO2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (roundabout protein)', 'R6FXH13RRC (Slit homolog 2 protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms9806 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms9806 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2015 Nov 26;6:8806. doi: 10.1038/ncomms9806.,,PMC4674765,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GEO/GSE73005', 'SRA/SRP062250']",,,,,,

Cancer cells efficiently use limited energy sources, and drugs targeting cellular metabolism improve the efficacy of therapy. In this study, we characterized the effects of novel anti-cancer fatty-acid derivative AIC-47 and imatinib, focusing on cancer-specific energy metabolism in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. AIC-47 and imatinib in combination exhibited a significant synergic cytotoxicity. Imatinib inhibited only the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL; whereas AIC-47 suppressed the expression of the protein itself. Both AIC-47 and imatinib modulated the expression of pyruvate kinase M (PKM) isoforms from PKM2 to PKM1 through the down-regulation of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1). PTBP1 functions as alternative splicing repressor of PKM1, resulting in expression of PKM2, which is an inactive form of pyruvate kinase for the last step of glycolysis. Although inactivation of BCR-ABL by imatinib strongly suppressed glycolysis, compensatory fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) activation supported glucose-independent cell survival by up-regulating CPT1C, the rate-limiting FAO enzyme. In contrast, AIC-47 inhibited the expression of CPT1C and directly fatty-acid metabolism. These findings were also observed in the CD34(+) fraction of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. These results suggest that AIC-47 in combination with imatinib strengthened the attack on cancer energy metabolism, in terms of both glycolysis and compensatory activation of FAO.","['Shinohara, Haruka', 'Kumazaki, Minami', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Ito, Yuko', 'Sugito, Nobuhiko', 'Kuranaga, Yuki', 'Taniguchi, Kohei', 'Yamada, Nami', 'Otsuki, Yoshinori', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Shinohara H', 'Kumazaki M', 'Minami Y', 'Ito Y', 'Sugito N', 'Kuranaga Y', 'Taniguchi K', 'Yamada N', 'Otsuki Y', 'Naoe T', 'Akao Y']","['United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.

Phenotypic and transcriptional profiling shows aberrant differentiation of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, impaired erythroid and lymphoid differentiation and strong skewing to the myeloid lineage, with only a mild relation to changes in DNA modification. We also observe progressive accumulation of phospho-H2AX and strong impairment of DNA damage repair pathways, suggesting a key role for TET proteins in maintaining genome integrity.","['An, Jungeun', 'Gonzalez-Avalos, Edahi', 'Chawla, Ashu', 'Jeong, Mira', 'Lopez-Moyado, Isaac F', 'Li, Wei', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Chavez, Lukas', 'Ko, Myunggon', 'Rao, Anjana']","['An J', 'Gonzalez-Avalos E', 'Chawla A', 'Jeong M', 'Lopez-Moyado IF', 'Li W', 'Goodell MA', 'Chavez L', 'Ko M', 'Rao A']","['Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Department of Pediatrics and Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.', 'Dan L.

As aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterning has been shown to play a role in leukaemogenesis, we studied the promoter methylation, expression profiles and molecular functions of PTPRD in paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: Bone marrow specimens were obtained from 32 Chinese patients with a mean age of 7.2 years (range 1.1-16.5). PTPRD and methylation status were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation-specific PCR. Western blot and flow cytometry techniques were also used. RESULTS: PTPRD expression was decreased by promoter region methylation in six AML cells and methylated in 21 (65.6%) of the 32 samples. In addition, PTPRD expression could be induced by the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, functional studies showed that overexpression of PTPRD in AML cells inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity as well as inducing apoptosis. However, PTPRD knockdown increased cell proliferation. These effects were associated with downregulation of cyclin D1, c-myc and upregulation of Bax. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that PTPRD was a potential tumour suppressor gene inactivated by DNA methylation in paediatric AML.","['Song, Lei', 'Jiang, Wen', 'Liu, Wei', 'Ji, Ju-Hua', 'Shi, Tai-Feng', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Xia, Chun-Qiu']","['Song L', 'Jiang W', 'Liu W', 'Ji JH', 'Shi TF', 'Zhang J', 'Xia CQ']","['Department of Paediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, Nantong Third People's Hospital, Nantong, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, Nantong Third People's Hospital, Nantong, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, Nantong Third People's Hospital, Nantong, Jiangsu, China."", 'School of Medicine, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160108,Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRD protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/apa.13284 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2016 Mar;105(3):e132-41. doi: 10.1111/apa.13284.

Previously, we found that in addition to acting through androgen receptor to directly regulate gene expression (classical testosterone signaling pathway), testosterone acts through a nonclassical pathway via the androgen receptor to rapidly activate kinases that are known to regulate spermatogenesis. In this study, we provide the first evidence that nonclassical testosterone signaling occurs in vivo as the MAP kinase cascade is rapidly activated in Sertoli cells within the testis by increasing testosterone levels in the rat. We find that either classical or nonclassical signaling regulates testosterone-mediated Rhox5 gene expression in Sertoli cells within testis explants. The selective activation of classical or nonclassical signaling pathways in Sertoli cells within testis explants also resulted in the differential activation of the Zbtb16 and c-Kit genes in adjacent spermatogonia germ cells. Delivery of an inhibitor of either pathway to Sertoli cells of mouse testes disrupted the blood-testis barrier that is essential for spermatogenesis. Furthermore, an inhibitor of nonclassical testosterone signaling blocked meiosis in pubertal mice and caused the loss of meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells in adult mouse testes. An inhibitor of the classical pathway caused the premature release of immature germ cells. Collectively, these observations indicate that classical and nonclassical testosterone signaling regulate overlapping and distinct functions that are required for the maintenance of spermatogenesis and male fertility.","['Toocheck, Corey', 'Clister, Terri', 'Shupe, John', 'Crum, Chelsea', 'Ravindranathan, Preethi', 'Lee, Tae-Kyung', 'Ahn, Jung-Mo', 'Raj, Ganesh V', 'Sukhwani, Meena', 'Orwig, Kyle E', 'Walker, William H']","['Toocheck C', 'Clister T', 'Shupe J', 'Crum C', 'Ravindranathan P', 'Lee TK', 'Ahn JM', 'Raj GV', 'Sukhwani M', 'Orwig KE', 'Walker WH']","['Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Urology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, Texas.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, Texas.', 'Department of Urology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas.', 'Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Research in Reproductive Physiology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Magee Womens Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania walkerw@pitt.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151125,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Rhox5 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB16 protein, rat)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fertility/drug effects/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Androgen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sertoli Cells/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Testis/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Testosterone/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/10/16 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.115.132068 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.115.132068 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2016 Jan;94(1):11. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.115.132068.

However, little is known about markers and targets expressed by LSCs. The aim of this project was to identify novel relevant markers of CML LSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CML LSCs were examined by flow cytometry, qPCR, and various bioassays. In addition, we examined the multipotent CD25(+)CML cell line KU812. RESULTS: In contrast to normal hematopoietic stem cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-)CML LSCs expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, IL-2RA (CD25). STAT5 was found to induce expression of CD25 in Lin(-)/Sca-1(+)/Kit(+)stem cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Correspondingly, shRNA-induced STAT5 depletion resulted in decreased CD25 expression in KU812 cells. Moreover, the BCR/ABL1 inhibitors nilotinib and ponatinib were found to decrease STAT5 activity and CD25 expression in KU812 cells and primary CML LSCs. A CD25-targeting shRNA was found to augment proliferation of KU812 cellsin vitroand their engraftmentin vivoin NOD/SCID-IL-2Rgamma(-/-)mice. In drug-screening experiments, the PI3K/mTOR blocker BEZ235 promoted the expression of STAT5 and CD25 in CML cells. Finally, we found that BEZ235 produces synergistic antineoplastic effects on CML cells when applied in combination with nilotinib or ponatinib. CONCLUSIONS: CD25 is a novel STAT5-dependent marker of CML LSCs and may be useful for LSC detection and LSC isolation in clinical practice and basic science. Moreover, CD25 serves as a growth regulator of CML LSCs, which may have biologic and clinical implications and may pave the way for the development of new more effective LSC-eradicating treatment strategies in CML.","['Sadovnik, Irina', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic, Andrea', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Berger, Daniela', 'Bilban, Martin', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Streubel, Berthold', 'Mannhalter, Christine', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Sexl, Veronika', 'Valent, Peter']","['Sadovnik I', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic A', 'Herrmann H', 'Eisenwort G', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Warsch W', 'Hoermann G', 'Greiner G', 'Blatt K', 'Peter B', 'Stefanzl G', 'Berger D', 'Bilban M', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Sill H', 'Sperr WR', 'Streubel B', 'Mannhalter C', 'Holyoake TL', 'Sexl V', 'Valent P']","['Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

Although cohesins are involved in chromosome separation and DNA damage repair, cohesin complex functions during hematopoiesis and leukemic development are unclear. Here, we show that mutant cohesin proteins block differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro and in vivo and enforce stem cell programs. These effects are restricted to immature HSPC populations, where cohesin mutants show increased chromatin accessibility and likelihood of transcription factor binding site occupancy by HSPC regulators including ERG, GATA2, and RUNX1, as measured by ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq.

A bla IMI-carrying Enterobacter cloacae, which was also resistant to colistin, is reported here. FINDINGS: E. cloacae strain WCHECl-1060 was recovered from a blood sample of a leukemia patient, who was not previously exposed to colistin. Strain WCHECl-1060 belongs to a new sequence type, ST410, and was resistant to carbapenems and colistin but was susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. A new allelic variant of bla IMI-1, which has two silent mutations compared to the original bla IMI-1 variant, was found in strain WCHECl-1060. Conjugation and transformation experiments failed to transfer bla IMI-1, suggesting a likely chromosome origin. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an IMI-1 carbapenemase-producing colistin-resistant E. cloacae in China. Microbiological laboratories should be aware of the unusual carbapenem-resistant but third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible profiles of these IMI-producing isolates.

The mutational status of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGVH) genes in CLL is a feature that is widely recognized for dividing patients into groups that are related to their prognoses. However, the regulatory programs associated with the IGVH statuses are poorly understood, and markers that can precisely predict survival outcomes have yet to be identified. METHODS: In this study, (i) we reconstructed gene regulatory networks in CLL by applying an information-theoretic approach to the expression profiles of 5 cohorts. (ii) We applied master regulator analysis (MRA) to these networks to identify transcription factors (TFs) that regulate an IGVH mutational status signature. The IGVH mutational status signature was developed by searching for differentially expressed genes between the IGVH mutational statuses in numerous CLL cohorts. (iii) To evaluate the biological implication of the inferred regulators, prognostic values were determined using time to treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in two different cohorts. RESULTS: A robust IGVH expression signature was obtained, and various TFs emerged as regulators of the signature in most of the reconstructed networks. The TF targets expression profiles exhibited significant differences with respect to survival, which allowed the definition of a reduced profile with a high value for OS. TCF7 and its targets stood out for their roles in progression. CONCLUSION: TFs and their targets, which were obtained merely from inferred regulatory associations, have prognostic implications and reflect a regulatory context for prognosis.","['Yepes, Sally', 'Torres, Maria Mercedes', 'Lopez-Kleine, Liliana']","['Yepes S', 'Torres MM', 'Lopez-Kleine L']","['Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota D.C., Colombia. sl.yepes233@uniandes.edu.co.', 'Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota D.C., Colombia. maritorr@uniandes.edu.co.', 'Departamento de Estadistica, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C., Colombia. llopezk@unal.edu.co.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/27 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/11/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-015-2189-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-015-2189-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2015 Nov 25;16:1002. doi: 10.1186/s12864-015-2189-6.,,PMC4659237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress has been implicated in CDK inhibition in CLL. Here we conducted a pre-clinical study of a novel orally active kinase inhibitor P1446A in CLL B-cells. P1446A inhibited CDKs at nanomolar concentrations and induced rapid apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro, irrespective of chromosomal abnormalities or IGHV mutational status. Apoptosis preceded inactivation of RNA polymerase, and was accompanied by phosphorylation of stress kinases JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Pharmacologic inhibitors of JNK/p38 MAPK conferred protection from P1446A-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with P1446A led to a dramatic induction of NOXA in a JNK-dependent manner, and sensitized CLL cells to ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic. We observed concurrent activation of apoptosis stress-inducing kinase 1 (ASK1) and its interaction with inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in CLL cells treated with P1446A, providing insights into upstream regulation of JNK in this setting. Consistent with previous reports on limited functionality of ER stress mechanism in CLL cells, treatment with P1446A failed to induce an extensive unfolded protein response. This study provides rationale for additional investigations of P1446A in CLL.","['Paiva, Cody', 'Godbersen, J Claire', 'Soderquist, Ryan S', 'Rowland, Taylor', 'Kilmarx, Sumner', 'Spurgeon, Stephen E', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Srinivasa, Sreesha P', 'Danilov, Alexey V']","['Paiva C', 'Godbersen JC', 'Soderquist RS', 'Rowland T', 'Kilmarx S', 'Spurgeon SE', 'Brown JR', 'Srinivasa SP', 'Danilov AV']","['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States of America.', 'Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, United States of America.', 'Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States of America.', 'Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, United States of America.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States of America.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Piramal Healthcare Ltd., Mumbai, India.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0143685 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-22871 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 25;10(11):e0143685. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143685. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4659573,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several evidences have shown that mitochondrial disruption, caspase activation, MAPK signaling and p53 are the pathways for arsenic induced apoptosis. Arsenic trioxide is an effective and potent antitumor agent used in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and produces dramatic remissions.

METHODS: A multicenter case-control survey was performed to identify predictors of lymphoma. Cases were patients who developed lymphoma after diagnosis of primary SS and were mainly recruited through the Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation network. For each case, 2 controls (matched for disease duration and age) were randomly selected among patients with primary SS and without lymphoma. Cases and controls were compared using univariate analysis and then using multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of lymphoma. RESULTS: One hundred one patients with primary SS and lymphoma were included. Eighty-seven patients were women (86.1%), and the mean +/- SD age at lymphoma diagnosis was 57.4 +/- 12.6 years. The most frequent histologic type was B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in 99 of 101 patients, with marginal-zone lymphoma in 76 of the 99 patients (76.8%) including 58 (58.6%) with lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type. Lymphomas were most frequently located in the salivary glands (43 patients). A specific treatment was initiated at diagnosis in 87 patients with B cell NHL, and 61 patients (61.6%) achieved complete sustained remission after the first line of treatment. In the multivariate analysis, salivary gland enlargement, the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), low C4, cryoglobulinemia, lymphopenia, and disease activity according to the European League Against Rheumatism Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (excluding the lymphoma domain) were found to be predictors of lymphoma. No previous treatment for primary SS was associated with any effect on lymphoma occurrence. CONCLUSION: In addition to previously known factors predictive of lymphoma occurrence, the independent roles of RF and disease activity were demonstrated in this case-control study of primary SS-associated lymphoma. Our findings highlight the roles of chronic antigenic stimulation and disease activity in the development of this severe complication.","['Nocturne, G', 'Virone, A', 'Ng, Wan-Fai', 'Le Guern, V', 'Hachulla, E', 'Cornec, D', 'Daien, C', 'Vittecoq, O', 'Bienvenu, B', 'Marcelli, C', 'Wendling, D', 'Amoura, Z', 'Dhote, R', 'Lavigne, C', 'Fior, R', 'Gottenberg, J E', 'Seror, R', 'Mariette, X']","['Nocturne G', 'Virone A', 'Ng WF', 'Le Guern V', 'Hachulla E', 'Cornec D', 'Daien C', 'Vittecoq O', 'Bienvenu B', 'Marcelli C', 'Wendling D', 'Amoura Z', 'Dhote R', 'Lavigne C', 'Fior R', 'Gottenberg JE', 'Seror R', 'Mariette X']","['Universite Paris-Sud, INSERM U1184, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Universite Paris Descartes and AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Universite Lille 2, Lille, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire (CHRU) de Brest, Hopital de la Cavale Blanche and EA 2216, INSERM ESPRI, ERI29, Universite de Brest, Brest, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Montpellier and URM5535 CNRS, Montpellier, France.', 'CHU de Rouen, INSERM U905, and Universite de Rouen, Rouen, France.', 'CHU de Caen, Hopital de la Cote de Nacre, Caen, France.', 'CHU de Caen, Hopital de la Cote de Nacre, Caen, France.', 'CHRU Besancon, and EA 4266, Universite de Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie and AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'CHU Avicenne, Bobigny, France.', 'CHU Angers, Angers, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Beclere, Clamart, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1109, CHRU Strasbourg, and Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, INSERM U1184, and AP-HP, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, INSERM U1184, and AP-HP, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arthritis Rheumatol,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",101623795,"['0 (Complement C4)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Complement C4/*immunology', 'Cryoglobulinemia/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Lymphopenia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mycosis Fungoides/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatoid Factor/*immunology', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/*epidemiology/immunology"", 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.39518 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016 Apr;68(4):977-85. doi: 10.1002/art.39518.,['G0800629/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,"['(c) 2016, American College of Rheumatology.']",,,,,,,,,"['Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016 May;68(5):1319-20.

Merging without direct patient identifiers would provide additional patient privacy protections. We sought to develop and validate a matching algorithm that uses only indirect patient identifiers. METHODS: We merged the data from two Phase III Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials for de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS). We developed a stepwise matching algorithm that used indirect identifiers including treatment site, gender, birth year, birth month, enrollment year and enrollment month. Results from the stepwise algorithm were compared against the direct merge method that used date of birth, treatment site, and gender. The indirect merge algorithm was developed on AAML0531 and validated on AAML1031. RESULTS: Of 415 patients enrolled on the AAML0531 trial at PHIS centers, we successfully matched 378 (91.1%) patients using the indirect stepwise algorithm. Comparison to the direct merge result suggested that 362 (95.7%) matches identified by the indirect merge algorithm were concordant with the direct merge result. When validating the indirect stepwise algorithm using the AAML1031 trial, we successfully matched 157 out of 165 patients (95.2%) and 150 (95.5%) of the indirectly merged matches were concordant with the directly merged matches. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that patients enrolled on COG clinical trials can be successfully merged with PHIS administrative data using a stepwise algorithm based on indirect patient identifiers. The merged data sets can be used as a platform for comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness studies.","['Li, Yimei', 'Hall, Matt', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Getz, Kelly D', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Li Y', 'Hall M', 'Fisher BT', 'Seif AE', 'Huang YS', 'Bagatell R', 'Getz KD', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Sung L', 'Adamson PC', 'Gamis A', 'Aplenc R']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Children's Hospital Association, Overland Park, Kansas, United States of America."", ""Division of Infectious Disease, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, United States of America."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, United States of America."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, United States of America."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri, United States of America."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151125,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', '*Databases, Factual', 'Humans', '*Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Medical Oncology', '*Pediatrics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0143480 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-11682 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 25;10(11):e0143480. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143480. eCollection 2015.,"['1R01 CA16527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA016527/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA165277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4659568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a proof-of-concept, murine bone marrow (BM) cells were transduced with a retroviral cDNA library encoding well-characterized oncogenes and homeobox genes, and the virus-transduced cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice. The proto-oncogenes responsible for leukemia initiation were identified by PCR amplification of cDNA inserts from genomic DNA isolated from leukemic cells. In an initial screen of ten leukemic mice, the MYC proto-oncogene was detected in all the leukemic mice. Of ten leukemic mice, 3 (30%) had MYC as the only transgene, and seven mice (70%) had additional proto-oncogene inserts. We repeated the same experiment after removing MYC-related genes from the library to characterize additional leukemia-inducing gene combinations. Our second screen using the MYC-deleted proto-oncogene library confirmed MEIS1and the HOX family as cooperating oncogenes in leukemia pathogenesis. The model system we introduced in this study will be valuable in functionally screening novel combinations of genes for leukemogenic potential in vivo, and the system will help in the discovery of new targets for leukemia therapy.","['Jang, Su Hwa', 'Lee, Sohyun', 'Chung, Hee Yong']","['Jang SH', 'Lee S', 'Chung HY']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0143240 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-21573 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 25;10(11):e0143240. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143240. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4659616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as in the case of most targeted anti-cancer therapies, the emergence of drug resistance is a serious concern. Several drug-resistant mutations affecting the catalytic domain of Abl and other tyrosine kinases are now known. But, despite their importance and the adverse effect that they have on the prognosis of the cancer patients harboring them, the molecular mechanism of these mutations is still debated. Here by using long molecular dynamics simulations and large-scale free energy calculations complemented by in vitro mutagenesis and microcalorimetry experiments, we model the effect of several widespread drug-resistant mutations of Abl. By comparing the conformational free energy landscape of the mutants with those of the wild-type tyrosine kinases we clarify their mode of action. It involves significant and complex changes in the inactive-to-active dynamics and entropy/enthalpy balance of two functional elements: the activation-loop and the conserved DFG motif. What is more the T315I gatekeeper mutant has a significant impact on the binding mechanism itself and on the binding kinetics.","['Lovera, Silvia', 'Morando, Maria', 'Pucheta-Martinez, Encarna', 'Martinez-Torrecuadrada, Jorge L', 'Saladino, Giorgio', 'Gervasio, Francesco L']","['Lovera S', 'Morando M', 'Pucheta-Martinez E', 'Martinez-Torrecuadrada JL', 'Saladino G', 'Gervasio FL']","['Department of Chemistry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Center of Technological Development in Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Proteomics Core Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Chemistry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Computational Biology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Thermodynamics']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004578 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-15-00577 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2015 Nov 25;11(11):e1004578. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004578. eCollection 2015 Nov.,,PMC4659586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here report on the development of ADCs with specificity for the B-cell lineage specific (surface) antigen CD22 being expressed in the majority of hematological malignancies. As targeting moiety a previously generated humanized anti-CD22 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derivative from the monoclonal antibody RFB4 was reengineered into a humanized IgG1 antibody format (huRFB4). Onconase (ranpirnase), a clinically active pancreatic-type ribonuclease, was employed as cytotoxic payload moiety. Chemical conjugation via thiol-cleavable disulfide linkage retained full enzymatic activity and full binding affinity of the ADC. Development of sophisticated purification procedures using size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography allowed the separation of immunoconjugate species with stoichiometrically defined number of Onconase cargos. A minimum of two Onconase molecules per IgG was required for achieving significant in vitro cytotoxicity towards lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Antibody-drug conjugates with an Onconase to antibody ratio of 3 : 1 exhibited an IC50 of 0.08 nM, corresponding to more than 18,400-fold increased cytotoxicity of the ADC when compared with unconjugated Onconase. These results justify further development of this ADC as a promising first-in-class compound for the treatment of CD22-positive malignancies.","['Weber, Tobias', 'Mavratzas, Athanasios', 'Kiesgen, Stefan', 'Haase, Stephanie', 'Botticher, Benedikt', 'Exner, Evelyn', 'Mier, Walter', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Jager, Dirk', 'Arndt, Michaela A E', 'Krauss, Jurgen']","['Weber T', 'Mavratzas A', 'Kiesgen S', 'Haase S', 'Botticher B', 'Exner E', 'Mier W', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Jager D', 'Arndt MA', 'Krauss J']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany ; Immunotherapy Program, National Center for Tumor Diseases, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151028,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Ribonucleases/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/561814 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol Res. 2015;2015:561814. doi: 10.1155/2015/561814.

Most of the time, hematologists are interested in evaluation of white blood cells only. Digital image processing techniques can help them in their analysis and diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main objective of this paper is to detect leukocytes from a blood smear microscopic image and segment them into their two dominant elements, nucleus and cytoplasm. The segmentation is conducted using two stages of applying K-means clustering. First, the nuclei are segmented using K-means clustering. Then, a proposed method based on region growing is applied to separate the connected nuclei. Next, the nuclei are subtracted from the original image. Finally, the cytoplasm is segmented using the second stage of K-means clustering. RESULTS: The results indicate that the proposed method is able to extract the nucleus and cytoplasm regions accurately and works well even though there is no significant contrast between the components in the image. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, a method based on K-means clustering and region growing is proposed in order to detect leukocytes from a blood smear microscopic image and segment its components, the nucleus and the cytoplasm. As region growing step of the algorithm relies on the information of edges, it will not able to separate the connected nuclei more accurately in poor edges and it requires at least a weak edge to exist between the nuclei. The nucleus and cytoplasm segments of a leukocyte can be used for feature extraction and classification which leads to automated leukemia detection.","['Sarrafzadeh, Omid', 'Dehnavi, Alireza Mehri']","['Sarrafzadeh O', 'Dehnavi AM']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Advanced Medical Technology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Advanced Medical Technology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150831,India,Adv Biomed Res,Advanced biomedical research,101586897,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2013/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2277-9175.163998 [doi]', 'ABR-4-174 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Biomed Res. 2015 Aug 31;4:174. doi: 10.4103/2277-9175.163998. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4617159,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood smear microscopic image', 'K-means clustering', 'leukocyte (WBC) segmentation', 'region growing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infant leukaemia is a rare disease that affects children in their first year of life. It has been estimated that approximately one third of infants with acute myeloid leukaemia harbour the t(7;12)(q36;p13) rearrangement in their leukaemic blasts. However, the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukaemia does not yet include the t(7;12) as a separate entity among the different genetic subtypes, although the presence of this chromosomal abnormality has been associated with an extremely poor clinical outcome. Currently, there is no consensus treatment for t(7;12) leukaemia patients. However, with the inferior outcome with the standard induction therapy, stem cell transplantation may offer a better chance for disease control. A better insight into the chromosome biology of this entity might shed some light into the pathogenic mechanisms arising from this chromosomal translocation, that at present are not fully understood. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of this disorder. This will hopefully open some grounds for possible tailored treatment for this subset of very young patients with inferior disease outcome. This review aims at highlighting the cytogenetic features that characterise the t(7;12) leukaemias for a better detection of the abnormality in the diagnostic setting. We also review treatment and clinical outcome in the cases reported to date.","['Tosi, Sabrina', 'Mostafa Kamel, Yasser', 'Owoka, Temitayo', 'Federico, Concetta', 'Truong, Tony H', 'Saccone, Salvatore']","['Tosi S', 'Mostafa Kamel Y', 'Owoka T', 'Federico C', 'Truong TH', 'Saccone S']","['Leukaemia and Chromosome Research Laboratory, Division of Biosciences, Brunel University London, Middlesex, UB8 3PH UK.', 'Leukaemia and Chromosome Research Laboratory, Division of Biosciences, Brunel University London, Middlesex, UB8 3PH UK.', 'Leukaemia and Chromosome Research Laboratory, Division of Biosciences, Brunel University London, Middlesex, UB8 3PH UK.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Sezione di Biologia Animale, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplant, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada."", 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Sezione di Biologia Animale, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151005,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-015-0041-4 [doi]', '41 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2015 Oct 5;3:21. doi: 10.1186/s40364-015-0041-4. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4657620,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'Chromosomal abnormalities', 'Clinical outcome', 'HLXB9 gene', 'Paediatric leukaemia', 't(7;12) translocation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the combined extract of these medicinal herbs (SL) has not been reported for its anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of SL on the creation of several proinflammatory mediators in RAW 264.7 cell mouse macrophages induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SL inhibited significantly the increase of NO, the release of intracellular calcium, the increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and MIP-2), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell at the concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mug/mL, and SL inhibited significantly the increase of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) at the concentrations of 25 and 50 mug/mL, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) at the concentration of 25 mug/mL. These results implicate that SL has anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the production of various inflammatory mediators in macrophages. But SL did not inhibit significantly the increase of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and Regulated on Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES); therefore, further study is demanded for the follow-up research to find out the possibility of SL as a preventive and therapeutic medicine for various inflammatory diseases.","['So, Mi-Hye', 'Choi, You-Kyung']","['So MH', 'Choi YK']","['Department of Korean International Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnamdaero Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Korean International Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnamdaero Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151029,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/203965 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015;2015:203965. doi: 10.1155/2015/203965.

The European Union pediatric legislation was introduced to improve pharmaceutical treatment of children, but some question whether the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approach is helping children with leukemia. Some have even suggested that the decisions of EMA pediatric committee (PDCO) are counterproductive. This study was designed to investigate the impact of PDCO-issued pediatric investigation plans (PIPs) for leukemia drugs. METHODS: All PIPs listed under ""oncology"" were downloaded from the EMA website. Non-leukemia decisions including misclassifications, waivers (no PIP), and solid tumors were discarded. The leukemia decisions were analyzed, compared to pediatric leukemia trials in the database http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, and discussed in the light of current literature. RESULTS: The PDCO leukemia decisions demand clinical trials in pediatric leukemia for all new adult drugs without prioritization. However, because leukemia in children is different and much rarer than in adults, these decisions have resulted in proposed studies that are scientifically and ethically questionable. They are also unnecessary, since once promising new compounds are approved for adults, more appropriate, prioritized pediatric leukemia trials are initiated worldwide without PDCO involvement. CONCLUSION: EMA/PDCO leukemia PIPs do little to advance the treatment of childhood leukemia. The unintended negative effects of the flawed EMA/PDCO's standardized requesting of non-prioritized testing of every new adult leukemia drug in children with relapsed or refractory disease expose these children to questionable trials, and could undermine public trust in pediatric clinical research. Institutions, investigators, and ethics committees/institutional review boards need to be skeptical of trials triggered by PDCO. New, better ways to facilitate drug development for pediatric leukemia are needed.","['Rose, Klaus', 'Walson, Philip D']","['Rose K', 'Walson PD']","['klausrose Consulting, Pediatric Drug Development and More, Riehen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Medical School, Goettingen, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151105,England,Risk Manag Healthc Policy,Risk management and healthcare policy,101566264,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/RMHP.S63029 [doi]', 'rmhp-8-185 [pii]']",epublish,Risk Manag Healthc Policy. 2015 Nov 5;8:185-205. doi: 10.2147/RMHP.S63029. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4640230,,,['NOTNLM'],"['better medicines for children', 'childhood leukemia', 'ghost studies', 'pediatric drug development', 'pediatric investigation plan', 'therapeutic hostages', 'therapeutic orphans']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In preclinical studies, clinically achievable concentrations of the third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI ponatinib inhibit T315I and all other single BCR-ABL1 mutants except T315M, which generates a single amino acid exchange, but requires 2 sequential nucleotide exchanges. In addition, certain compound mutants (containing >/=2 mutations in cis) confer resistance. Initial analyses based largely on conventional Sanger sequencing (SS) have suggested that the preclinical relationship between BCR-ABL1 mutation status and ponatinib efficacy is generally recapitulated in patients receiving therapy. Thus far, however, such analyses have been limited by the inability of SS to definitively identify compound mutations or mutations representing less than ~20% of total alleles (referred to as ""low-level mutations""), as well as limited patient follow-up. Here we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to define the baseline BCR-ABL1 mutation status of 267 heavily pretreated chronic phase (CP)-CML patients from the PACE trial, and used SS to identify clonally dominant mutants that may have developed on ponatinib therapy (30.1 months median follow-up). Durable cytogenetic and molecular responses were observed irrespective of baseline mutation status and included patients with compound mutations. No single or compound mutation was identified that consistently conferred primary and/or secondary resistance to ponatinib in CP-CML patients. Ponatinib is effective in CP-CML irrespective of baseline mutation status.","['Deininger, Michael W', 'Hodgson, J Graeme', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Li, Jin', 'Parker, Wendy T', 'Lustgarten, Stephanie', 'Clackson, Tim', 'Haluska, Frank G', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Rivera, Victor M', 'Branford, Susan']","['Deininger MW', 'Hodgson JG', 'Shah NP', 'Cortes JE', 'Kim DW', 'Nicolini FE', 'Talpaz M', 'Baccarani M', 'Muller MC', 'Li J', 'Parker WT', 'Lustgarten S', 'Clackson T', 'Haluska FG', 'Guilhot F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Soverini S', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hughes TP', 'Rivera VM', 'Branford S']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA;', 'University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea;"", 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, & INSERM U1052, Lyon, France;', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology ""L. and A.

CLL involves an accumulation of abnormal B cells which result in dysregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis rates. The calcyclin-binding protein/Siah-1-interacting protein (CacyBP/SIP) plays a pivotal role in tumorigenicity and cell apoptosis. Here, we investigated the function of CacyBP/SIP in CLL cell proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: CacyBP/SIP expression levels were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 23 Chinese CLL patients and three healthy donors by western blotting. Correlation analysis was performed to assess associations between CacyBP/SIP expression and clinical stage, chromosome abnormalities and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) expression. We silenced CacyBP/SIP expression in MEC-1 cells using a lentivirus system and analyzed cell vitality, cell cycle and tumorigenicity. Apoptosis was also analyzed following the upregulation of CacyBP/SIP expression in MEC-1 cells. RESULTS: Downregulation of CacyBP/SIP expression in CLL patients was negatively correlated with CLL clinical stage, but not with patient sex, age, del(13q14) or del(17q-) presence, or ZAP-70 expression. CacyBP/SIP silencing significantly enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. CacyBP/SIP silencing promoted accumulation of cells in S phase by upregulation of beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and downregulation of p21. Moreover, CacyBP/SIP overexpression facilitated CLL apoptosis through the activation of pro-caspase-3. CONCLUSION: CacyBP/SIP is a useful indicator of CLL disease processes and plays an important role in sustaining the balance of cell proliferation and apoptosis.","['Fu, Chunling', 'Wan, Yan', 'Shi, Hengliang', 'Gong, Yanqing', 'Wu, Qingyun', 'Yao, Yao', 'Niu, Mingshan', 'Li, Zhenyu', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Fu C', 'Wan Y', 'Shi H', 'Gong Y', 'Wu Q', 'Yao Y', 'Niu M', 'Li Z', 'Xu K']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.

Thirty-six 8-week-old female Kunming mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 12) and administered daily raloxifene (22 mg/kg), clomiphene citrate (18 mg/kg), and normal saline (1 mL), respectively, by gavage. Two days later, mice were injected with 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin and mated. Successfully mated female animals were identified with vaginal plugs designated gestation day 1. At day 4.5, pregnant donor mice were euthanized, and uterus samples were collected for immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Homeobox gene 10, integrin beta3, and LIF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were significantly higher in the raloxifene-treated animals compared with the clomiphene citrate group (all P < .05) but not significantly different from saline group values, except for LIF and integrin beta3 mRNA levels (P < .05). Pinopodes were abundant and well developed in the raloxifene and saline groups; however, in the clomiphene citrate-treated mice, fewer and poorly developed pinopodes were obtained. In mice, raloxifene had no effect on HOXA10, integrin beta3, and LIF expression as well as pinopode production, suggesting it has no adverse effects on endometrial receptivity. Raloxifene may provide a viable alternative oral ovulation induction agent to clomiphene citrate.","['Chen, Cairong', 'Yan, Qiuxia', 'Liu, Kunping', 'Zhou, Xiuqin', 'Xian, Yingjie', 'Liang, Dali', 'Zhao, Xiaoying', 'Guo, Xiaoyan', 'Quan, Song']","['Chen C', 'Yan Q', 'Liu K', 'Zhou X', 'Xian Y', 'Liang D', 'Zhao X', 'Guo X', 'Quan S']","[""Reproductive Medicine Center, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China Reproductive Medicine Center, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Department of Pathology, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Department of Laboratory, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", ""Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, People's Hospital of Qingyuan, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan, China."", 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China quansong@smu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151123,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', '1HRS458QU2 (Clomiphene)', '4F86W47BR6 (Raloxifene Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/administration & dosage', 'Clomiphene/*administration & dosage', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*administration & dosage', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Integrin beta Chains/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Raloxifene Hydrochloride/*administration & dosage']",2015/11/26 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719115616496 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719115616496 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2016 Jun;23(6):748-55. doi: 10.1177/1933719115616496.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of cyclin E1 suppression on sorafenib-induced apoptosis were tested in both sorafenib-sensitive (Huh-7 and HepG2, IC50 5-6 mumol/L) and sorafenib-resistant (Huh-7R and HepG2R, IC50 14-15 mumol/L) hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The activity of pertinent signaling pathways and the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins were measured using Western blotting. Efficacy of sorafenib combined with the pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol was tested both in vitro and in xenograft experiments. The pertinent downstream mediators of antitumor efficacy were tested in transient transfection and RNA interference experiments. RESULTS: Cyclin E1 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed after sorafenib treatment in sorafenib-sensitive but not in sorafenib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Changes in cyclin E2 or D1 were not correlated with sorafenib sensitivity. The knockdown of cyclin E1 expression reversed the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib in terms of cell growth and apoptosis induction, whereas the overexpression of cyclin E1 increased the resistance to sorafenib. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib were enhanced by flavopiridol, and Mcl-1 suppression was determined to play a critical role in mediating this enhancing effect. CONCLUSIONS: The cyclin E1 suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for predicting sorafenib efficacy. The combination of sorafenib and CDK inhibitors may improve the efficacy of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2555-64.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy was utilized to interrogate the pyruvate metabolism of the bone marrow in the murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model. Nanostring technology was used to evaluate a gene set defining a hypoxia signature in leukemic blasts and normal donors. The efficacy of the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 was examined in the in vitro and in vivo leukemia models. RESULTS: Metabolic imaging has demonstrated increased glycolysis in the femur of leukemic mice compared with healthy control mice, suggesting metabolic reprogramming of hypoxic bone marrow niches. Primary leukemic blasts in samples from AML patients overexpressed genes defining a ""hypoxia index"" compared with samples from normal donors. TH-302 depleted hypoxic cells, prolonged survival of xenograft leukemia models, and reduced the leukemia stem cell pool in vivo In the aggressive FLT3/ITD MOLM-13 model, combination of TH-302 with tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib had greater antileukemia effects than either drug alone. Importantly, residual leukemic bone marrow cells in a syngeneic AML model remain hypoxic after chemotherapy. In turn, administration of TH-302 following chemotherapy treatment to mice with residual disease prolonged survival, suggesting that this approach may be suitable for eliminating chemotherapy-resistant leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate a pathogenic role of hypoxia in leukemia maintenance and chemoresistance and demonstrate the feasibility of targeting hypoxic cells by hypoxia cytotoxins.","['Benito, Juliana', 'Ramirez, Marc S', 'Millward, Niki Zacharias', 'Velez, Juliana', 'Harutyunyan, Karine G', 'Lu, Hongbo', 'Shi, Yue-Xi', 'Matre, Polina', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo', 'Ma, Helen', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Volgin, Andrei', 'Protopopova, Marina', 'Mu, Hong', 'Lee, Jaehyuk', 'Bhattacharya, Pratip K', 'Marszalek, Joseph R', 'Davis, R Eric', 'Bankson, James A', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Hart, Charles P', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Benito J', 'Ramirez MS', 'Millward NZ', 'Velez J', 'Harutyunyan KG', 'Lu H', 'Shi YX', 'Matre P', 'Jacamo R', 'Ma H', 'Konoplev S', 'McQueen T', 'Volgin A', 'Protopopova M', 'Mu H', 'Lee J', 'Bhattacharya PK', 'Marszalek JR', 'Davis RE', 'Bankson JA', 'Cortes JE', 'Hart CP', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Imaging Physics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Diagnostic Imaging, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Imaging Physics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Cancer Systems Imaging, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Imaging Physics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. mkonople@mdanderson.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151124,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitroimidazoles)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (TH 302)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Nitroimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/*pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-3378 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-3378 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Apr 1;22(7):1687-98. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-3378.

This study assessed the prevalence of comorbid conditions relevant to TKI treatment choice among CML patients in the US real-world setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had CML and initiated TKI treatment were identified from the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2013). Demographics and prevalence of comorbid conditions relevant to TKI treatment choice per NCCN guidelines (heart disease, arrhythmia, diabetes, pancreatitis, pleural effusion, lung disease) were assessed among the overall study population and among subgroups. RESULTS: The median age of the CML study population newly initiated on TKI treatment (ie, imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib; n = 2296) was 56 years. Approximately 41% of the CML study population had at least 1 comorbid condition that may influence the choice of TKI treatment as recommended by NCCN guidelines. The most prevalent comorbid condition was heart disease (23%), followed by diabetes (18%) and lung disease (13%). The prevalence of comorbid conditions relevant to TKI treatment choice varied among patients of different age groups, gender, and US regions. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis provide real-world evidence that the prevalence of relevant comorbid conditions is substantial among CML patients in the US managed care setting and therefore needs to be considered throughout various health care decision-making processes related to CML.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Makenbaeva, Dinara', 'Lingohr-Smith, Melissa', 'Lin, Jay']","['Jabbour E', 'Makenbaeva D', 'Lingohr-Smith M', 'Lin J']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

However, bulk transplants are still performed when assessing the HSC potential of early embryonic hematopoietic tissues such as the aorta-gonad mesonephros (AGM) due to very low HSC activity content early in development. Intra-bone marrow transplantation (IBMT) has emerged as a superior administration route over intravenous (IV) transplantation for assessing the reconstituting ability of human HSCs in the xenotransplant setting since it bypasses the requirement for homing to the BM. In this study, we compared the ability of IBMT and IV administration of embryonic day 11.5 AGM-derived cells to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of myeloablated recipients. IBMT resulted in higher levels of AGM HSC long-term multilineage engraftment in the peripheral blood, BM, spleen, and thymus of primary and secondary recipients, and in limiting dilution experiments. The administration route did not skew the multilineage contribution pattern, but IBMT conferred higher Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-kit(+) long-term engraftment, in line with the superior IBMT reconstitution. Therefore, IBMT represents a superior administration route to detect HSC activity from developmentally early sources with limited HSC activity content, such as the AGM.","['Sanjuan-Pla, Alejandra', 'Romero-Moya, Damia', 'Prieto, Cristina', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Bigas, Anna', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Sanjuan-Pla A', 'Romero-Moya D', 'Prieto C', 'Bueno C', 'Bigas A', 'Menendez P']","['1 Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Barcelona , Barcelona, Spain .', '1 Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Barcelona , Barcelona, Spain .', '1 Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Barcelona , Barcelona, Spain .', '1 Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Barcelona , Barcelona, Spain .', ""2 Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM) , Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain ."", '1 Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Barcelona , Barcelona, Spain .', '3 Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA) , Barcelona, Spain .']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160107,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology/embryology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/transplantation', 'Gonads/cytology/embryology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Mesonephros/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/10/21 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2015.0309 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2016 Feb 1;25(3):259-65. doi: 10.1089/scd.2015.0309.

The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical course of children and adolescents with LBL treated at a tertiary center. METHODS: this is a retrospective cohort study of 27 patients aged 16 years or younger with LBL admitted between January 1981 and December 2013. Patients were treated according to the therapy protocol used for acute lymphoblastic leucemia. Diagnosis was based on biopsy of tumor and/or cytological examination of pleural effusions. The overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: the median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years (interquartile range, 4.6- 13.8). LBL had T-cell origin in 16 patients (59%). The most common primary manifestation in T-cell LBL was mediastinal involvement, in 9 patients (56%). Intra-abdominal tumor was the major site of involvement in patients with precursor B-LBL. Most patients had advanced disease (18 patients - 67%) at diagnosis. Twenty-four patients (89%) achieved complete clinical remission. After a median follow-up of 43 months (interquartile range, 6.4-95), 22 patients (81%) were alive in first complete remission. Five children (18.5%) died, three of them soon after admission and two after relapsing. The probability of survival at five years for 20 patients with de novo LBL was 78% (SD 9.4).

Using a cloud-based health care database, we identified patients with malignancies that often require cardiotoxic treatments (leukemia/lymphoma and lung, breast, colon, renal, and head and neck cancers). We report the prevalence of CVDs (coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure) in those populations. Overall, CVD prevalences were 33% for hematologic, 43% for lung, 17% for breast, 26% for colon, 35% for renal, and 26% for head and neck cancers. Generally, patients with lung and hematologic malignancies had the highest prevalence of all types of CVDs. Of those with CVD, only half were referred to cardiologists and received guideline-directed medical therapy. The prevalence of CVDs is unexpectedly high and suboptimally managed in patients with cancer.

The present mixed-methods study aimed to enlighten allo-HSCT effects on patients' and close relatives' quality of life (QOL) and their relationships. METHODS: Patients who received allo-HSCT between 2007 and 2010 (N = 58) and their close relatives (parents, partners and/or adult children) were asked to respond to an anonymous questionnaire including socio-demographic data, Likert-scale of the impact of HSCT on sexual, couple, family, professional and social life, as well as on perceived support. QOL of patients and close relatives was evaluated (by the FACT-BMT and by WHO-QOL-bref) as were the adjustments of the couples (patients/partners by the DAS). In-depth interviews were performed with patients and partners who consented to this proposition. RESULTS: Patients (N = 28) and close relatives (N = 48) reported fatigue, sleep and sexual problems, emotional distress and relationship difficulties. Patients were mainly concerned with << being a burden >> to their close relatives. Close relatives' main concerns were changes in marital and family dynamics, disruptions in daily routine tasks and the responsibility for being the main provider of physical and emotional care. These difficulties increased after HSCT - notably when patients have to face the long-term consequences of the procedure. CONCLUSION: HSCT has a negative impact on patients' partners and other close relatives' QOL. Data on this topic is still scarce and this study might pave the way for future research in this field and notably guide psychosocial interventions.","['Polomeni, A', 'Lapusan, S', 'Bompoint, C', 'Rubio, M T', 'Mohty, M']","['Polomeni A', 'Lapusan S', 'Bompoint C', 'Rubio MT', 'Mohty M']","[""Departement d'Hematologie clinique et therapie cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 184 rue du Fbg Saint Antoine, 75012 Paris, France.

We hypothesized that PLZF-deficient ILC2s have functional defects in the innate allergic response and represent a tool for studying innate immunity in a mouse with a functional adaptive immune response. OBJECTIVE: We determined the consequences of PLZF deficiency on ILC2 function in response to innate and adaptive immune stimuli by using PLZF(-/-) mice and mixed wild-type:PLZF(-/-) bone marrow chimeras. METHODS: PLZF(-/-) mice, wild-type littermates, or mixed bone marrow chimeras were treated with the protease allergen papain or the cytokines IL-25 and IL-33 or infected with the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis to induce innate type 2 allergic responses. Mice were sensitized with intraperitoneal ovalbumin-alum, followed by intranasal challenge with ovalbumin alone, to induce adaptive TH2 responses. Lungs were analyzed for immune cell subsets, and alveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for ILC2-derived cytokines. In addition, ILC2s were stimulated ex vivo for their capacity to release type 2 cytokines. RESULTS: PLZF-deficient lung ILC2s exhibit a cell-intrinsic defect in the secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 in response to innate stimuli, resulting in defective recruitment of eosinophils and goblet cell hyperplasia. In contrast, the adaptive allergic inflammatory response to ovalbumin and alum was unimpaired. CONCLUSIONS: PLZF expression at the innate lymphoid cell precursor stage has a long-range effect on the functional properties of mature ILC2s and highlights the importance of these cells for innate allergic responses in otherwise immunocompetent mice.","['Verhoef, Philip A', 'Constantinides, Michael G', 'McDonald, Benjamin D', 'Urban, Joseph F Jr', 'Sperling, Anne I', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Verhoef PA', 'Constantinides MG', 'McDonald BD', 'Urban JF Jr', 'Sperling AI', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill; Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Critical Care, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.', 'Diet, Genomics, and Immunology Laboratory, Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Md.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill; Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill; Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.

Differentiation of HSCs is characterised by decreased expression of genes associated with self-renewal accompanied by a stepwise activation of genes promoting differentiation. Lineage branching is further directed by groups of cooperating and counteracting genes forming complex networks of lineage-specific transcription factors. Imbalances in such networks can result in blockage of differentiation, lineage reprogramming and malignant transformation. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) was originally identified 30 years ago as a transcription factor that binds both promoter and enhancer regions. Most of the early work focused on the role of C/EBPalpha in regulating transcriptional processes as well as on its functions in key differentiation processes during liver, adipogenic and haematopoietic development. Specifically, C/EBPalpha was shown to control differentiation by its ability to coordinate transcriptional output with cell cycle progression. Later, its role as an important tumour suppressor, mainly in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), was recognised and has been the focus of intense studies by a number of investigators. More recent work has revisited the role of C/EBPalpha in normal haematopoiesis, especially its function in HSCs, and also started to provide more mechanistic insights into its role in normal and malignant haematopoiesis. In particular, the differential actions of C/EBPalpha isoforms, as well as its importance in chromatin remodelling and cellular reprogramming, are beginning to be elucidated. Finally, recent work has also shed light on the dichotomous function of C/EBPalpha in AML by demonstrating its ability to act as both a tumour suppressor and promoter. In the present review, we will summarise the current knowledge on the functions of C/EBPalpha during normal and malignant haematopoiesis with special emphasis on the recent work.","['Ohlsson, E', 'Schuster, M B', 'Hasemann, M', 'Porse, B T']","['Ohlsson E', 'Schuster MB', 'Hasemann M', 'Porse BT']","['The Finsen Laboratory/Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory/Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory/Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Finsen Laboratory/Rigshospitalet, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Stem Cell Centre (DanStem), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015324 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.324 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Apr;30(4):767-75. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.324.

IFN-alpha was shown to induce clinical, hematological, molecular and histopathological responses in small clinical studies. Such combined efficacy has never been achieved with any other drug to date in such a significant proportion of patients. However, toxicity remains a limitation to its broader use despite the development of pegylated forms with better tolerance. Several on going phase 3 studies of peg- IFN-alpha versus hydroxyurea will help to define its exact place in MPN management. IFN-alpha efficacy is likely the consequence of a broad range of biological properties, including enhancement of immune response, direct effects on malignant cells and ability to cycle dormant malignant stem cells. However, comprehensive elucidation of its mechanism of action is still lacking. Sustained clinical, molecular and morphological responses after IFN-alpha discontinuation raised the hope that this drug could eradicate MPN. There is now consistent evidence showing that IFN-alpha is able to eliminate malignant clones harboring JAK2V617F or Calreticulin mutations. However, the molecular complexity of these diseases could hamper IFN-alpha efficacy, as the presence of additional non-driver mutations, like in the TET2 gene, could be associated with resistance to IFN-alpha. Therefore, combined therapy with another targeted agent could be required to eradicate MPN, and the best IFN-alpha companion for achieving this challenge remains to be determined.","['Kiladjian, J-J', 'Giraudier, S', 'Cassinat, B']","['Kiladjian JJ', 'Giraudier S', 'Cassinat B']","[""Centre d'Investigations Cliniques, Hopital Saint-Louis, APHP, Paris, France."", ""INSERM UMR-S 1131, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", ""INSERM UMR-S 1131, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", ""Hopital Henri Mondor, APHP, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Creteil, France."", 'UPEC, Faculte de Medicine, Creteil, France.', ""INSERM UMR-S 1131, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", 'Hopital Saint-Louis, APHP, Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015326 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.326 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Apr;30(4):776-81. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.326.

Addressing the contribution of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to AML-induced hematopoietic failure we show that MSC from AML patients (n=64) exhibit significant growth deficiency and impaired osteogenic differentiation capacity. This was molecularly reflected by a specific methylation signature affecting pathways involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and skeletal development. In addition, we found distinct alterations of hematopoiesis-regulating factors such as Kit-ligand and Jagged1 accompanied by a significantly diminished ability to support CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) assays. This deficient osteogenic differentiation and insufficient stromal support was reversible and correlated with disease status as indicated by Osteocalcin serum levels and LTC-IC frequencies returning to normal values at remission. In line with this, cultivation of healthy MSC in conditioned medium from four AML cell lines resulted in decreased proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, AML-derived MSC are molecularly and functionally altered and contribute to hematopoietic insufficiency. Inverse correlation with disease status and adoption of an AML-like phenotype after exposure to leukemic conditions suggests an instructive role of leukemic cells on bone marrow microenvironment.","['Geyh, S', 'Rodriguez-Paredes, M', 'Jager, P', 'Khandanpour, C', 'Cadeddu, R-P', 'Gutekunst, J', 'Wilk, C M', 'Fenk, R', 'Zilkens, C', 'Hermsen, D', 'Germing, U', 'Kobbe, G', 'Lyko, F', 'Haas, R', 'Schroeder, T']","['Geyh S', 'Rodriguez-Paredes M', 'Jager P', 'Khandanpour C', 'Cadeddu RP', 'Gutekunst J', 'Wilk CM', 'Fenk R', 'Zilkens C', 'Hermsen D', 'Germing U', 'Kobbe G', 'Lyko F', 'Haas R', 'Schroeder T']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'University Tumor Center Duesseldorf, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'University Tumor Center Duesseldorf, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteocalcin/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/26 06:00'],"['2015/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015325 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.325 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):683-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.325.

However, studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been impeded in part by the lack of continuous human cell lines. CLL cells have a high spontaneous apoptosis rate in vitro and exhibit minimal proliferation in xenograft models. Therefore, there is a need for development of primary CLL cell lines and we describe the isolation of such a line from the bone marrow of a CLL patient (17p deletion and TP53 mutation) which has been in long term culture for more than 12 months with continuous proliferation. The CLL cell line (termed MDA-BM5) which was generated in vitro with continuous co-culture on autologous stromal cells is CD19+CD5+ and shows an identical pattern of somatic hypermutation as determined in the patient's bone marrow (BM), confirming the origin of the cells from the original CLL clone. MDA-BM5 cells were readily transplantable in NOD/SCID gamma null mice (NSG) with disease developing in the BM, liver and spleen. BM cells from quaternary serial transplantation in NSG mice demonstrated the presence of CD19+CD5+ cells with Ig restricted to lambda which is consistent with the original patient cells. These studies describe a new CLL cell line from a patient with del(17p) that provides a unique model for in vitro and in vivo studies.","['Kellner, Joshua', 'Wierda, William', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Keating, Michael', 'McNiece, Ian']","['Kellner J', 'Wierda W', 'Shpall E', 'Keating M', 'McNiece I']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX, United States.

Although cis-element polymorphisms and mutations are instructive, deciphering function remains challenging. Mutation of an intronic GATA motif (+9.5) in GATA2, encoding a master regulator of hematopoiesis, underlies an immunodeficiency associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whereas an inversion relocalizes another GATA2 cis-element (-77) to the proto-oncogene EVI1, inducing EVI1 expression and AML, whether this reflects ectopic or physiological activity is unknown. We describe a mouse strain that decouples -77 function from proto-oncogene deregulation. The -77(-/-) mice exhibited a novel phenotypic constellation including late embryonic lethality and anemia. The -77 established a vital sector of the myeloid progenitor transcriptome, conferring multipotentiality. Unlike the +9.5(-/-) embryos, hematopoietic stem cell genesis was unaffected in -77(-/-) embryos. These results illustrate a paradigm in which cis-elements in a locus differentially control stem and progenitor cell transitions, and therefore the individual cis-element alterations cause unique and overlapping disease phenotypes.","['Johnson, Kirby D', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Gao, Xin', 'Chang, Yuan-I', 'Hewitt, Kyle J', 'Sanalkumar, Rajendran', 'Prathibha, Rajalekshmi', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Dewey, Colin N', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Johnson KD', 'Kong G', 'Gao X', 'Chang YI', 'Hewitt KJ', 'Sanalkumar R', 'Prathibha R', 'Ranheim EA', 'Dewey CN', 'Zhang J', 'Bresnick EH']","['Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ; University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI 53705, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150904,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1126/sciadv.1500503 [doi]', '1500503 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2015 Sep 4;1(8):e1500503. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1500503. eCollection 2015 Sep.,"['R01 HL113066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HG007019/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4643771,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GATA factor', 'GATA-2', 'cis-element', 'differentiation', 'hematopoiesis', 'myeloid', 'progenitor', 'stem cell', 'transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the cytotoxic effects of various nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for HIV-1 on ATL cells and found that abacavir potently and selectively kills ATL cells. Although NRTIs have minimal genotoxicities on host cells, the therapeutic concentration of abacavir induced numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the chromosomal DNA of ATL cells. DSBs persisted over time in ATL cells but not in other cell lines, suggesting impaired DNA repair. We found that the reduced expression of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), a repair enzyme, is attributable to the cytotoxic effect of abacavir on ATL cells. We also showed that TDP1 removes abacavir from DNA ends in vitro. These results suggest a model in which ATL cells with reduced TDP1 expression are unable to excise abacavir incorporated into genomic DNA, leading to irreparable DSBs. On the basis of the above mechanism, we propose abacavir as a promising chemotherapeutic agent for ATL.","['Tada, Kohei', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki', 'Takiuchi, Yoko', 'Iwai, Fumie', 'Sakamoto, Takashi', 'Nagata, Kayoko', 'Shinohara, Masanobu', 'Io, Katsuhiro', 'Shirakawa, Kotaro', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Shindo, Keisuke', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu', 'Hirota, Kouji', 'Yamamoto, Junpei', 'Iwai, Shigenori', 'Sasanuma, Hiroyuki', 'Takeda, Shunichi', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Tada K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Takiuchi Y', 'Iwai F', 'Sakamoto T', 'Nagata K', 'Shinohara M', 'Io K', 'Shirakawa K', 'Hishizawa M', 'Shindo K', 'Kadowaki N', 'Hirota K', 'Yamamoto J', 'Iwai S', 'Sasanuma H', 'Takeda S', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 1-1 Minami-Osawa, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan.', 'Division of Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, 1-3 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-8531, Japan.', 'Division of Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, 1-3 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-8531, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150424,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1126/sciadv.1400203 [doi]', '1400203 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2015 Apr 24;1(3):e1400203. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1400203. eCollection 2015 Apr.,,PMC4640626,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Abacavir', 'Adult T-cell leukemia', 'DNA repair', 'nucleoside-analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor', 'tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we have developed a new technology for detection of leukemia cells up to 300 cells/ml using a compact fiber HC-PCF, which offers a novel alternative to existing clinical standards.

This illness can manifest as meningitis, or as a micotic aneurism, stroke or abscess. The infection affects the CNS either primarily or, more often, secondarily via blood dissemination from a distant focus, and has a poor prognosis. We present a patient with IA primarily affecting the cervical bones, with later spread into the brain. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year old male was receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia when he developed pneumonitis secondary to methotrexate and was started on corticosteroids. He subsequently developed cervicalgia, prompting a needle biopsy of the fourth vertebrae, after which a diagnosis of osteomyelitis was made. Even though the biopsy culture was negative, empirical antibiotics were initiated. A parietal lobe lesion was treated surgically months later after the patient presented with three episodes of transient aphasia. After A. fumigatus grew in culture, the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to treat the specific agent with a good response. CONCLUSION: IA must be considered a possibility whenever an immunocompromised patient presents with a new brain lesion. These lesions require surgical evacuation, a procedure that allows for diagnostic confirmation and enhances prognosis. Appropriate anti-fungal therapy must be started as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. In addition, the patient's neurological exam must be repeated and images obtained periodically to monitor treatment and detect possible recurrences.","['Vergara, Guillermo Enrique', 'Roura, Natalia', 'Del Castillo, Marcelo', 'Mora, Andrea', 'Alcorta, Santiago Condomi', 'Mormandi, Ruben', 'Cervio, Andres', 'Salvat, Jorge']","['Vergara GE', 'Roura N', 'Del Castillo M', 'Mora A', 'Alcorta SC', 'Mormandi R', 'Cervio A', 'Salvat J']","['Neurocirujanos del Departamento de Neurocirugia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Traumatologos (Neurortopedistas) del Departamento de Neurocirugia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Infectologos del Departamento de Infectologia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Infectologos del Departamento de Infectologia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Neurocirujanos del Departamento de Neurocirugia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Neurocirujanos del Departamento de Neurocirugia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Neurocirujanos del Departamento de Neurocirugia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Neurocirujanos del Departamento de Neurocirugia de FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",,['spa'],['Case Reports'],20151012,United States,Surg Neurol Int,Surgical neurology international,101535836,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2152-7806.167203 [doi]', 'SNI-6-524 [pii]']",epublish,Surg Neurol Int. 2015 Oct 12;6(Suppl 20):S524-9. doi: 10.4103/2152-7806.167203. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4623611,,,,,,,,,,Aspergilosis cervical con diseminacion al sistema nervioso central.

The RCSD1 gene is located at 1q23 and ABL1 is located at 9q34, so that the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion typically arises through a rare reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q23;q34). Only a small number of RCSD1-ABL1 positive cases of B-ALL have been described in the literature, and the full spectrum of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and molecular features associated with this genetic abnormality has not been defined. We describe extensive genetic characterization of a case of B-ALL with RCSD1-ABL1 fusion, by using conventional cytogenetic analysis, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) studies, and Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA). The use of CMA resulted in detection of an approximately 70 kb deletion at 7p12.2, which caused a disruption of the IKZF1 gene. Deletions and mutations of IKZF1 are recurring abnormalities in B-ALL and are associated with a poor prognosis. Our findings highlight the association of the deletion of IKZF1 gene with the t(1;9)(q24;q34) and illustrate the importance of comprehensive cytogenetic and molecular evaluation for accurate prediction of prognosis in patients with B-cell ALL.","['Kamran, Shawana', 'Raca, Gordana', 'Nazir, Kamran']","['Kamran S', 'Raca G', 'Nazir K']","['Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Combined Military Hospital, Kharian 50090, Pakistan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151027,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/353247 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2015;2015:353247. doi: 10.1155/2015/353247.

The main function of this proteoglycan is the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis; however, more recently described roles for fibromodulin have expanded to include regulation of angiogenesis, reprogramming of human fibroblasts into pluripotent cells, modulation of TGF-beta activity, inflammatory processes and association with metastatic phenotypes. Additionally, fibromodulin has been identified as a novel tumor-associated antigen in leukemia, lymphoma, and leiomyoma. Knowledge about its expression in the prostate is limited. METHODS: Fibromodulin expression was analyzed in two different malignant and one non-tumorigenic prostatic cell lines in culture, and in benign and malignant human prostate tissue. Expression was analyzed by real time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. DNA sequencing was performed on a PCR fragment amplified with primers specific for the FMOD gene from cDNA obtained from the cultured cell lines. RESULTS: Both immunostaining and real time PCR analysis of cell lines indicated that fibromodulin was differentially expressed in the cancerous cell lines compared to the non-tumorigenic cell line. Likewise, cancerous tissue expressed significantly higher levels of intracellular fibromodulin compared to matched, benign tissue from the same patients, as well as compared to tissue from patients with only benign disease. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of fibromodulin was higher in prostatic cancer cells (cell-lines and human tissue) than in normal/benign prostatic cells. Additional studies are required to determine the biological and clinical significance and whether this proteoglycan has a role in carcinogenesis of the prostate or in prostate cancer related inflammatory processes.","['Reyes, Niradiz', 'Benedetti, Ines', 'Bettin, Alfonso', 'Rebollo, Juan', 'Geliebter, Jan']","['Reyes N', 'Benedetti I', 'Bettin A', 'Rebollo J', 'Geliebter J']","['School of Medicine, University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia.', 'Research Group of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Colombia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia.', 'Research Group of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Colombia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia.', 'Research Group of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Colombia.', 'New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '126468-95-9 (Fibromodulin)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fibromodulin', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Essential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Prostate/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['CBM555 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-150555 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2016;16(1):191-202. doi: 10.3233/CBM-150555.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fibromodulin', 'corpora amylacea', 'extracellular matrix', 'immunohistochemistry', 'inflammation', 'prostate cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survivin is a member of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family, it prevents apoptosis by blocking caspase activity and play a role in cell proliferation. While, cyclin E2 is one of the cyclins proteins family that controls progression of cell cycle by activation of cyclin dependant-kinase. OBJECTIVE: Was to assess survivin and cyclin E2 genes expression in acute leukemia (AL) patients, and to define their role in the susceptibility of AL, and their correlation with the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, as well as treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 60 de novo AL patients and 40 control subjects to study the expression of survivin and cyclin E2 genes using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Survivin and cyclin E2 genes expression was significantly higher in leukemic patients compared with control subjects (P< 0.001), both genes separately were associated with increased risk of leukemia development and treatment failure (P< 0.01). Moreover, when combining the 2 genes expression, a significant elevation of the risk of leukemia and treatment failure was found (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Survivin and cyclin E2 genes expression may have clinical relevance and can be considered as molecular risk factors for AL. Also they may be useful as predictive markers for treatment outcome in leukemic patients.","['Makhlouf, Manal Mohamed']",['Makhlouf MM'],,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CCNE2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survivin', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['CBM554 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-150554 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2016;16(1):181-9. doi: 10.3233/CBM-150554.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['RT-PCR', 'Survivin', 'acute leukemia', 'cyclin E2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate characteristic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (including diffusion weighted imaging and susceptibility weighted imaging) of myeloid sarcoma involving the brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred nine patients with pathologically proven myeloid sarcoma underwent pretreatment CT and MRI, which were retrospectively reviewed. Computed tomography and MRI characteristics reviewed include lesion location, shape, size, architecture, margins, +/- multiplicity, +/- bone destruction, pattern and degree of enhancement, +/- restricted diffusion, and +/- susceptibility artifact. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (14 men, 11 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 9-80 years) met the inclusion criteria. Acute myeloid leukemia with subtypes M3 (44.4%) and M5 (22.2%) were the most common. On unenhanced CT, mean lesion size was 1.9 +/- 0.4 cm; 60% were intra-axial hyperdense masses, 8% were intraventricular hyperdense masses, 12% were isodense intra-axial masses, and 20% of cases were extra-axial hyperdense nodular masses. There was no observable intralesional or perilesional calcium. On MRI, mean lesion size was 2.1 +/- 0.6 cm. The lesions were isointense (80%) or hypointense (20%) on T1-weighted images with homogeneous (88%) or heterogeneous (12%) enhancement. On fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted images, lesions were hyperintense (96%) or isointense (4%) with mild vasogenic edema. Majority (96%) of cases demonstrated restricted diffusion, whereas only a few (16%) demonstrated susceptibility artifact. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with history of leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder, identification of homogenous mass hyperdense on unenhanced CT, T1 isointense, and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense with restricted diffusion and homogenous postcontrast enhancement without significant susceptibility artifact is suggestive of myeloid sarcoma.","['Chaudhry, Ammar A', 'Gul, Maryam', 'Chaudhry, Abbas A', 'Dunkin, Jared']","['Chaudhry AA', 'Gul M', 'Chaudhry AA', 'Dunkin J']","['From the *Department of Radiology, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook; and daggerDepartment of Internal Medicine, Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, NY.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Comput Assist Tomogr,Journal of computer assisted tomography,7703942,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Child', '*Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/RCT.0000000000000337 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2016 Jan-Feb;40(1):61-6. doi: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane Hsp70 (mHsp70) is rapidly internalized into tumor cells and thus targeting of mHsp70 might provide a promising strategy for theranostics. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are contrast negative agents that are used for the detection of tumors with MRI. Herein, we conjugated the Hsp70-specific antibody (cmHsp70.1) which is known to recognize mHsp70 to superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles to assess tumor-specific targeting before and after ionizing irradiation. In vitro experiments demonstrated the selectivity of SPION-cmHsp70.1 conjugates to free and mHsp70 in different tumor cell types (C6 glioblastoma, K562 leukemia, HeLa cervix carcinoma) in a dose-dependent manner. High-resolution MRI (11 T) on T(2)-weighted images showed the retention of the conjugates in the C6 glioma model. Accumulation of SPION-cmHsp70.1 nanoparticles in the glioma resulted in a nearly 2-fold drop of T*(2) values in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Biodistribution analysis using NLR-M(2) measurements showed a 7-fold increase in the tumor-to-background (normal brain) uptake ratio of SPION-cmHsp70.1 conjugates in glioma-bearing rats in comparison to SPIONs. This accumulation within Hsp70-positive glioma was further enhanced after a single dose (10 Gy) of ionizing radiation. Elevated accumulation of the magnetic conjugates in the tumor due to radiosensitization proves the combination of radiotherapy and application of Hsp70-targeted agents in brain tumors.","['Shevtsov, Maxim A', 'Nikolaev, Boris P', 'Ryzhov, Vyacheslav A', 'Yakovleva, Ludmila Y', 'Marchenko, Yaroslav Y', 'Parr, Marina A', 'Rolich, Valerij I', 'Mikhrina, Anastasiya L', 'Dobrodumov, Anatolii V', 'Pitkin, Emil', 'Multhoff, Gabriele']","['Shevtsov MA', 'Nikolaev BP', 'Ryzhov VA', 'Yakovleva LY', 'Marchenko YY', 'Parr MA', 'Rolich VI', 'Mikhrina AL', 'Dobrodumov AV', 'Pitkin E', 'Multhoff G']","['Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), Tikhoretsky ave., 4, St. Petersburg, 194064, Russia. shevtsov-max@mail.ru.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151124,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Chemoradiotherapy/*methods', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Gamma Rays/*therapeutic use', 'Glioma/*therapy', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/10/11 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5nr06521f [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2015 Dec 28;7(48):20652-64. doi: 10.1039/c5nr06521f.

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) leaves have been widely used in traditional medicine and is currently used as a dietary supplement because of their high nutrient content. We previously reported the cytotoxic activity of alfalfa leaf extracts against several sensitive and multidrug resistant tumor cell lines. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to determine whether medicarpin and millepurpan, two isoflavonoids isolated from alfalfa leaves, may have pro-apoptotic effects against drug-sensitive (P388) and multidrug resistant P388 leukemia cells (P388/DOX). STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Cells were incubated with medicarpin or millepurpan for the appropriate time. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell cycle analysis was realized by flow cytometry technics. Caspases 3 and 9 activities were measured using Promega caspACE assay kits. Proteins and genes expression were visualized respectively by western-blot using specific antibodies and RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: P-glycoprotein-expressing P388/DOX cells did not show resistance to medicarpin (IC50 approximately 90 microM for P388 and P388/DOX cells) and millepurpan (IC50 = 54 microM and 69 microM for P388 and P388/DOX cells, respectively). Treatment with medicarpin or millepurpan triggered apoptosis in sensitive as well as multidrug resistant P388 cells. These effects were mediated through the mitochondrial pathway by modifying the balance pro/anti-apoptotic proteins. While 3 microM doxorubicin alone could not induce cell death in P388/DOX cells, concomitant treatment with doxorubicin and subtoxic concentration of medicarpin or millepurpan restored the pro-apoptotic cascade. Each compound increased sensitivity of P388/DOX cells to doxorubicin whereas they had no effect in sensitive P388 cells. Vinblastine cytotoxicity was also enhanced in P388/DOX cells (IC50 = 210 nM to 23 and 25 nM with medicarpin and millepurpan, respectively). This improved sensitivity was mediated by an increased uptake of doxorubicin in P388/DOX cells expressing P-gp. P-gp expression was not altered by exposure to medicarpin and millepurpan. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that medicarpin and millepurpan possess pro-apoptotic properties and potentiate the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs in multidrug resistant P388 leukemia cells by modulating P-gp-mediated efflux of drugs. These flavonoids may be used as chemopreventive agents or as sensitizer to enhance cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs in multidrug resistant cancer cells.","['Gatouillat, Gregory', 'Magid, Abdulmagid Alabdul', 'Bertin, Eric', 'El btaouri, Hassan', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Lavaud, Catherine', 'Madoulet, Claudie']","['Gatouillat G', 'Magid AA', 'Bertin E', 'El btaouri H', 'Morjani H', 'Lavaud C', 'Madoulet C']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire, Faculte de Pharmacie, URCA, Reims, France.', 'Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie, Faculte de Pharmacie, SFR Cap Sante, ICMR-CNRS UMR 7312, Reims, France.', ""Service d'endocrinologie, de diabetologie et de nutrition, CHU Robert-Debre, Reims, France."", 'MEDyC UMR CNRS/URCA no. 7369, Faculte des Sciences, SFR Cap Sante, URCA, Reims, France.', 'MEDyC UMR CNRS/URCA no. 7369, Faculte de Pharmacie, SFR Cap Sante, URCA, Reims, France.', 'Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie, Faculte de Pharmacie, SFR Cap Sante, ICMR-CNRS UMR 7312, Reims, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire, Faculte de Pharmacie, URCA, Reims, France.

Among the most highly enriched proteins in this set are those in the glycolysis pathway, including the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, hexokinase-1. Detailed biochemical and metabolomics analyses of the highly homologous hexokinase-2 (HK2), which is overexpressed in many cancers, revealed significant inhibition by arsenic.

Here we use a suspended microchannel resonator to monitor the volume and density of single cells in suspension with a precision of 1% and 0.03%, respectively. We find that for transformed murine lymphocytic leukemia and mouse pro-B cell lymphoid cell lines, mitotic cells reversibly increase their volume by more than 10% and decrease their density by 0.4% over a 20-min period. This response is correlated with the mitotic cell cycle but is not coupled to nuclear osmolytes released by nuclear envelope breakdown, chromatin condensation, or cytokinesis and does not result from endocytosis of the surrounding fluid. Inhibiting Na-H exchange eliminates the response. Although mitotic rounding of adherent cells is necessary for proper cell division, our observations that suspended cells undergo reversible swelling during mitosis suggest that regulation of intracellular water may be a more general component of mitosis than previously appreciated.","['Son, Sungmin', 'Kang, Joon Ho', 'Oh, Seungeun', 'Kirschner, Marc W', 'Mitchison, T J', 'Manalis, Scott']","['Son S', 'Kang JH', 'Oh S', 'Kirschner MW', 'Mitchison TJ', 'Manalis S']","['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142 Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139 srm@mit.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Size', 'Endocytosis', 'Mice', '*Mitosis', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jcb.201505058 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.201505058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2015 Nov 23;211(4):757-63. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201505058.,"['P30 CA014051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM039565/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA143874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4657169,,['(c) 2015 Son et al.'],,,,,,,,,['J Cell Biol. 2015 Nov 23;211(4):733-5.

Enforced expression of LMO2 causes leukemia by inducing hematopoietic stem cell-like features in T-cell progenitor cells, but the biochemical mechanisms of LMO2 function have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we systematically dissected the LMO2/LDB1-binding interface to investigate the role of this interaction in T-cell leukemia. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the LIM interaction domain of LDB1 revealed a discrete motif, R(320)LITR, required for LMO2 binding. Most strikingly, coexpression of full-length, wild-type LDB1 increased LMO2 steady-state abundance, whereas coexpression of mutant proteins deficient in LMO2 binding compromised LMO2 stability. These mutant LDB1 proteins also exerted dominant negative effects on growth and transcription in diverse leukemic cell lines. Mass spectrometric analysis of LDB1 binding partners in leukemic lines supports the notion that LMO2/LDB1 function in leukemia occurs in the context of multisubunit complexes, which also protect the LMO2 oncoprotein from degradation. Collectively, these data suggest that the assembly of LMO2 into complexes, via direct LDB1 interaction, is a potential molecular target that could be exploited in LMO2-driven leukemias resistant to existing chemotherapy regimens.","['Layer, Justin H', 'Alford, Catherine E', 'McDonald, W Hayes', 'Dave, Utpal P']","['Layer JH', 'Alford CE', 'McDonald WH', 'Dave UP']","['Departments of Medicine and Cancer Biology, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Mass Spectrometry Research Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Cancer Biology, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA utpal.dave@vanderbilt.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151123,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'LIM Domain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00901-15 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00901-15 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2015 Nov 23;36(3):488-506. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00901-15.

Forced Sp5 expression can reproduce partial effects of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling but mimics most features of LIF-Stat3 signaling to maintain undifferentiated mESCs. Moreover, Sp5 is able to convert mouse epiblast stem cells into a naive pluripotent state. Thus, Sp5 is an important component of the regulatory network governing mESC naive pluripotency.","['Ye, Shoudong', 'Zhang, Dongming', 'Cheng, Fei', 'Wilson, Daniel', 'Mackay, Jeffrey', 'He, Kan', 'Ban, Qian', 'Lv, Feng', 'Huang, Saifei', 'Liu, Dahai', 'Ying, Qi-Long']","['Ye S', 'Zhang D', 'Cheng F', 'Wilson D', 'Mackay J', 'He K', 'Ban Q', 'Lv F', 'Huang S', 'Liu D', 'Ying QL']","[""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA."", ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China."", 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.', ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, People's Republic of China seansean2015@ahu.edu.cn qying@med.usc.edu."", 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA seansean2015@ahu.edu.cn qying@med.usc.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151123,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.177675 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.177675 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2016 Jan 15;129(2):269-76. doi: 10.1242/jcs.177675.

These syndromes might be confounders because they are associated with an increased cancer risk and may increase the likelihood of CT scans performed in children. METHODS: We identify CSS predisposing to leukemia and brain tumors through a systematic literature search and summarize prevalence and risk estimates. Because there is virtually no empirical evidence in published literature on patterns of CT use for most types of CSS, we estimate confounding bias of relative risks (RR) for categories of radiation exposure based on expert opinion about the current and previous patterns of CT scans among CSS patients. RESULTS: We estimate that radiation-related RRs for leukemia are not meaningfully confounded by Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or other CSS. In contrast, RRs for brain tumors may be overestimated due to confounding by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) while von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, or other CSS do not meaningfully confound. Empirical data on the use of CT scans among CSS patients are urgently needed. CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment indicates that associations with leukemia reported in previous studies are unlikely to be substantially confounded by unmeasured CSS, whereas brain tumor risks might have been overestimated due to confounding by TSC. IMPACT: Future studies should identify TSC patients in order to avoid overestimation of brain tumor risks due to radiation exposure from CT scans.","['Meulepas, Johanna M', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'Merks, Johannes', 'Weijerman, Michel E', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Hauptmann, Michael']","['Meulepas JM', 'Ronckers CM', 'Merks J', 'Weijerman ME', 'Lubin JH', 'Hauptmann M']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Department of Paediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. m.hauptmann@nki.nl.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20151123,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Child', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Syndrome', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/10/26 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-15-0636 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0636 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2016 Jan;25(1):114-26. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0636.

This study aimed to systematically review the evidence regarding dexrazoxane in children. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and abstracts for RCTs and nonrandomized studies (NRSs) that compared dexrazoxane to no cardioprotection among children. We combined findings using random-effects models. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Eleven eligible publications reported results from five RCTs (1254 patients), and 15 publications reported results from 12 NRSs (3385 patients). Dexrazoxane did not impact clinical cardiotoxicity in RCTs because of a low cardiotoxic event rate (three events among all patients) but was associated with a reduction in subclinical cardiotoxicity. Among NRSs, dexrazoxane was associated with a reduction in clinical cardiotoxicity (relative risk (RR) = 0.29, P = .001) and clinical+subclinical cardiotoxicity (RR = 0.43, P < .001). Among RCTs, 17 of 635 (2.7%) patients treated with dexrazoxane developed an SMN compared with seven of 619 (1.1%) who did not receive dexrazoxane (RR = 2.37, P = .06). Two RCTs that used concurrent etoposide reported an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia, while one that used cranial radiation reported an increased risk of brain tumors. Event-free survival did not differ (P = .91). CONCLUSION: Dexrazoxane is associated with a statistically significant risk reduction for most cardiotoxic outcomes. Dexrazoxane is associated with a statistically borderline increase in SMNs, possibly because of an interaction with concurrent cancer therapies.

We demonstrated that the antihypertensive drug rilmenidine, a selective imidazoline I1 receptor agonist, modulates proliferation and stimulates the proapoptotic protein Bax thus inducing the perturbation of the mitochondrial pathway and apoptosis in human leukemic K562 cells. Rilmenidine acts through a mechanism which involves deactivation of Ras/MAP kinases ERK, p38 and JNK. Moreover, rilmenidine renders K562 cells, which are particularly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, susceptible to the DNA damaging drug doxorubicin. The rilmenidine co-treatment with doxorubicin reverses G2/M arrest and triggers apoptotic response to DNA damage. Our data offer new insights into the pathways associated with imidazoline I1 receptor activation in K562 cells suggesting rilmenidine as a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of imidazoline I1 receptor signaling in hematologic malignancies and to search for medicinally active agents.","['Srdic-Rajic, Tatjana', 'Nikolic, Katarina', 'Cavic, Milena', 'Djokic, Ivana', 'Gemovic, Branislava', 'Perovic, Vladimir', 'Veljkovic, Nevena']","['Srdic-Rajic T', 'Nikolic K', 'Cavic M', 'Djokic I', 'Gemovic B', 'Perovic V', 'Veljkovic N']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Pasterova 14, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 450, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Pasterova 14, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Center for Multidisciplinary Research, Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca, University of Belgrade, Mihaila Petrovica Alasa 14, 11001, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Center for Multidisciplinary Research, Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca, University of Belgrade, Mihaila Petrovica Alasa 14, 11001, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Center for Multidisciplinary Research, Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca, University of Belgrade, Mihaila Petrovica Alasa 14, 11001, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Center for Multidisciplinary Research, Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca, University of Belgrade, Mihaila Petrovica Alasa 14, 11001, Belgrade, Serbia.

We analysed the prognostic impact of MRD level at complete remision after induction therapy using multiparameter flow cytometry in 306 non-APL AML patients. First, we validated the prognostic value of MRD-thresholds we have previously proposed (>/= 0.1%; >/= 0.01-0.1%; and <0.01), with a 5-year RFS of 38%, 50% and 71%, respectively (p=0.002). Cytogenetics is the most relevant prognosis factor in AML, however intermediate risk cytogenetics represent a grey zone that require other biomarkers for risk stratification, and we show that MRD evaluation discriminate three prognostic subgroups (p=0.03). Also, MRD assessments yielded relevant information on favourable and adverse cytogenetics, since patients with favourable cytogenetics and high MRD levels have poor prognosis and patients with adverse cytogenetics but undetectable MRD overcomes the adverse prognosis. Interestingly, in patients with intermediate or high MRD levels, intensification with transplant improved the outcome as compared with chemotherapy, while the type of intensification therapy did not influenced the outcome of patients with low MRD levels. Multivariate analysis revealed age, MRD and cytogenetics as independent variables. Moreover, a scoring system, easy in clinical practice, was generated based on MRD level and cytogenetics.","['Vidriales, Maria-Belen', 'Perez-Lopez, Estefania', 'Pegenaute, Carlota', 'Castellanos, Marta', 'Perez, Jose-Juan', 'Chandia, Mauricio', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, Joaquin', 'Rayon, Consuelo', 'de Las Heras, Natalia', 'Fernandez-Abellan, Pascual', 'Cabezudo, Miguel', 'de Coca, Alfonso Garcia', 'Alonso, Jose M', 'Olivier, Carmen', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Fernandez, Rosa', 'Garcia-Suarez, Julio', 'Garcia, Magdalena', 'Sayas, Maria-Jose', 'Paiva, Bruno', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'San Miguel, Jesus F']","['Vidriales MB', 'Perez-Lopez E', 'Pegenaute C', 'Castellanos M', 'Perez JJ', 'Chandia M', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Rayon C', 'de Las Heras N', 'Fernandez-Abellan P', 'Cabezudo M', 'de Coca AG', 'Alonso JM', 'Olivier C', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Montesinos P', 'Fernandez R', 'Garcia-Suarez J', 'Garcia M', 'Sayas MJ', 'Paiva B', 'Gonzalez M', 'Orfao A', 'San Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Spain; Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer (CIC-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Spain.

Preexisting gene expression programs in LSCs can be used to assess their transcriptional similarity to hematopoietic cell types. While this relationship has previously been examined on a small scale, an analysis that systematically investigates this relationship throughout the hematopoietic hierarchy has yet to be implemented. We developed an integrative approach to assess the similarity between AML patient tumor profiles and a collection of 232 murine hematopoietic gene expression profiles compiled by the Immunological Genome Project. The resulting lineage similarity scores (LSS) were correlated with patient survival to assess the relationship between hematopoietic similarity and patient prognosis. This analysis demonstrated that patient tumor similarity to immature hematopoietic cell types correlated with poor survival. As a proof of concept, we highlighted one cell type identified by our analysis, the short-term reconstituting stem cell, whose LSSs were significantly correlated with patient prognosis across multiple datasets, and showed distinct patterns in patients stratified by traditional clinical variables. Finally, we validated our use of murine profiles by demonstrating similar results when applying our method to human profiles.","['Varn, Frederick S', 'Andrews, Erik H', 'Cheng, Chao']","['Varn FS', 'Andrews EH', 'Cheng C']","['Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, 1 Rope Ferry Road, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, 1 Rope Ferry Road, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, 1 Rope Ferry Road, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.', 'Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Sciences, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03766, USA.', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, One Medical Center Drive Lebanon, New Hampshire 03766, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151124,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Transcriptome']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['srep16987 [pii]', '10.1038/srep16987 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Nov 24;5:16987. doi: 10.1038/srep16987.,"['P20 GM103534/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR001086/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001086/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008704/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR001088/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4657053,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous study has shown that there is a strong correlation between the secreted matricellular protein osteopontin (OPN) level and disease severity in ATL patients. Here, we investigated the role of OPN in ATL pathogenesis and the possible application of anti-OPN monoclonal antibody (mAb) for ATL immunotherapy in NOD/Shi-scid,IL-2Rg (null) (NOG) mice. RESULTS: Subcutaneous inoculation of ATL cell lines into NOG mice increased the plasma level of OPN, which significantly correlated with metastasis of the inoculated cells and survival time. Administration of an SVVYGLR motif-recognizing anti-OPN mAb resulted in inhibition not only of tumor growth but also of tumor invasion and metastasis. The number of fibroblast activating protein-positive fibroblasts was also reduced by this mAb. We then co-inoculated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild-type (WT) or OPN knockout mice together with ATL-derived TL-OmI cells into the NOG mice. The mice co-inoculated with WT MEFs displayed a significant decrease in survival relative to those injected with TL-OmI cells alone and the absence of OPN in MEFs markedly improved the survival rate of TL-OmI-inoculated mice. In addition, tumor volume and metastasis were also reduced in the absence of OPN. CONCLUSION: We showed that the xenograft NOG mice model can be a useful system for assessment of the physiological role of OPN in ATL pathogenesis. Using this xenograft model, we found that fibroblast-derived OPN was involved in tumor growth and metastasis, and that this tumor growth and metastasis was significantly suppressed by administration of the anti-OPN mAbs. Our findings will lead to a novel mAb-mediated immunotherapeutic strategy targeting against the interaction of OPN with integrins on the tumor of ATL patients.","['Maeda, Naoyoshi', 'Ohashi, Takashi', 'Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile', 'Hattori, Toshio', 'Takahashi, Yayoi', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Maenaka, Katsumi', 'Uede, Toshimitsu']","['Maeda N', 'Ohashi T', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Hattori T', 'Takahashi Y', 'Harigae H', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Fujii M', 'Maenaka K', 'Uede T']","['Division of Molecular Immunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0815, Japan. nmaeda@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Research Center for Infection-associated Cancer, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0815, Japan. nmaeda@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Center for Research and Education on Drug Discovery, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-6, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan. nmaeda@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Division of Molecular Virology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0815, Japan. ohashi-t@igm.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Disaster-Related Infectious Diseases, International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan. haorile@irides.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Disaster-Related Infectious Diseases, International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan. toshatto@med.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan. ytakahashi@patholo2.med.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan. harigae@med.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8102, Japan. hhase@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8102, Japan. y-yamada@sanwa.or.jp.', 'Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan. fujiimas@med.niigata-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Biomolecular Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-6, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan. maenaka@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Center for Research and Education on Drug Discovery, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-6, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan. maenaka@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Division of Molecular Immunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0815, Japan. uedetoshimitsu@icloud.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151124,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Integrins)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunotherapy', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/virology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Osteopontin/blood/deficiency/*immunology/*metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-015-0225-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-015-0225-x [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2015 Nov 24;12:99. doi: 10.1186/s12977-015-0225-x.,,PMC4657376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that a gene expression profile associated with WT1 expression levels might be a good surrogate marker. We identified high WT1 gene sets by comparing the gene expression profiles in the highest and lowest quartiles of WT1 expression in two large AML studies. Two high WT1 gene sets were found to be highly correlated in terms of the altered genes and expression profiles. We identified a 17-probe set signature of the high WT1 set as the optimal prognostic predictor in the first AML set, and showed that it was able to predict prognosis in the second AML series after adjustment for European LeukaemiaNet genetic groups. The gene signature also proved to be of prognostic value in a third AML series of 163 samples assessed by RNA sequencing, demonstrating its cross-platform consistency. This led us to derive a 4-gene expression score, which faithfully predicted adverse outcome. In conclusion, a short gene signature associated with high WT1 expression levels and the resultant 4-gene expression score were found to be predictive of adverse prognosis in AML. This study provides new clues to the molecular pathways underlying high WT1 states in leukaemia.","['Niavarani, Ahmadreza', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Reyal, Yasmin', 'Sauerland, Maria C', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Niavarani A', 'Herold T', 'Reyal Y', 'Sauerland MC', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Valk PJ', 'Bonnet D']","['Digestive Oncology Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute (DDRI), Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Haematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Centre Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151124,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'WT1 Proteins/*blood/genetics']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13836 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Feb;172(3):401-11. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13836.

This study describes the purification and characterization of glutaminase free asparaginase from Pseudomonas otitidis. The purified enzyme exhibited molecular mass of approximately 205+/-3 kDa on native-PAGE and 34+/-1 kDa on SDS-PAGE, revealing that the enzyme is homohexamer. The isoelectric point of enzyme was 5.5, calculated by 2D-PAGE. Optimum activity of asparaginase was achieved at 40 degrees C and pH 7.5, which is close to the internal environment of the human body. Monovalent cations (Na(+) and K(+)) and reducing agents (2-mercaptoethanol and glutathione) has enhanced asparaginase activity. Whereas, divalent (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Zn(2+) and Mn(2+)), trivalent (Fe(3+)) cations and thiol group blocking agent (iodoacetamide) inhibited the enzyme activity significantly. In vitro serum and trypsin half life of asparaginase is almost 2 and 1.5 fold respectively, which is higher than commercial asparaginase. MTT assay results showed that the anticancer activity of purified asparaginase was comparable or higher than commercial E. coli asparaginase.

A Deoxycytidine Analog With Excellent Anticancer Activity.",3881-96,,"Thiarabine has demonstrated exceptional antitumor activity against numerous human tumor xenografts in mice, being superior to gemcitabine, clofarabine, or cytarabine. Unlike cytarabine, thiarabine demonstrated excellent activity against solid tumor xenografts, suggesting that this agent has the kind of robust activity in animal models that leads to clinical utility. Thiarabine is effective orally (bioavailability of approximately 16%) and with once per day dosing: Two characteristics that distinguish it from cytarabine. Although both the structure and basic mechanism of action of thiarabine are similar to that of cytarabine, there are many quantitative differences in the biochemical pharmacology of these two agents that can explain the superior antitumor activity of thiarabine. Two important attributes are the long retention time of the 5'-triphosphate of thiarabine in tumor cells and its potent inhibition of DNA synthesis. The biochemical pharmacology of thiarabine is also different from that of gemcitabine. Thiarabine has been evaluated in three phase I clinical trials, where it has demonstrated some activity in heavily pretreated patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Because of its impressive activity against numerous human tumor xenografts in mice, its unique biochemical activity, and encouraging clinical results in phase I clinical trials, we believe thiarabine should continue to be evaluated in the clinic for treatment of hematologic and/or solid tumors. The preclinical results to date (superior in vivo antitumor activity, oral bioavailability, and once per day dosing), suggest that thiarabine could replace cytarabine in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Parker, W B', 'Waud, W R', 'Secrist, J A 3rd']","['Parker WB', 'Waud WR', 'Secrist JA 3rd']","['PNP Therapeutics, 15 Richard Arrington Jr. Blvd North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, USA. bparker@pnptherapeutics.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Nucleosides)', ""YCO2764D5Z (4'-thio-arabinofuranosylcytosine)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/08 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC-EPUB-71954 [pii]', '10.2174/092986732234151119153534 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2015;22(34):3881-96. doi: 10.2174/092986732234151119153534.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now analyzed 206 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (88 % of 233 patients randomized in the EORTC/GMDSSG phase III trial 06011, 61 of them with RAEBt, i.e. AML by WHO) with cytogenetics informative for MK status.. Endpoints are the following: complete/partial (CR/PR) and overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cytogenetic subgroups are the following: 63 cytogenetically normal (CN) patients, 143 with cytogenetic abnormalities, 73 of them MK-negative (MK-), and 70 MK-positive (MK+). These MK+ patients could be divided into 17 with a single autosomal monosomy (MK1) and 53 with at least two monosomies (MK2+). ORR with DAC in CN patients: 36.1 %, in MK- patients: 16.7 %, in MK+ patients: 43.6 % (MK1: 44.4 %, MK2+ 43.3 %). PFS was prolonged by DAC compared to best supportive care (BSC) in the CN (hazard ratio (HR) 0.55, 99 % confidence interval (CI), 0.26; 1.15, p = 0.03) and MK2+ (HR 0.50; 99 % CI, 0.23; 1.06, p = 0.016) but not in the MK-, MK+, and MK1 subgroups. OS was not improved by DAC in any subgroup. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time in a randomized phase III trial that high-risk MDS patients with complex karyotypes harboring two or more autosomal monosomies attain encouraging responses and have improved PFS with DAC treatment compared to BSC.","['Lubbert, Michael', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Ruter, Bjorn', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Labar, Boris', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Muus, Petra', 'Pfluger, Karl-Heinz', 'Schaefer, Hans-Eckart', 'Bogatyreva, Lioudmila', 'Aul, Carlo', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Huls, Gerwin', 'van der Helm, Lieke', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Wijermans, Pierre W']","['Lubbert M', 'Suciu S', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Ruter B', 'Platzbecker U', 'Giagounidis A', 'Selleslag D', 'Labar B', 'Germing U', 'Salih HR', 'Muus P', 'Pfluger KH', 'Schaefer HE', 'Bogatyreva L', 'Aul C', 'de Witte T', 'Ganser A', 'Becker H', 'Huls G', 'van der Helm L', 'Vellenga E', 'Baron F', 'Marie JP', 'Wijermans PW']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Marienhospital, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, AZ Sint-Jan Brugge-Oostende, Brugge, Belgium.', 'University Hospital Center Rebro, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine II, DIAKO Bremen, Bremen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Biometry and Medical Informatics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, St Johannes Hospital, Duisburg, Germany.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'C.H.U.

PPP genes have been reported to be primarily or secondarily upregulated in many cancers. We aimed to study the general alteration of PPP in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We performed data mining and analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML dataset for genetic alteration of the PPP gene set. In vitro studies including proliferation, migration, and invasion assays, together with metabolite consumption and oxidation assays, were performed. PPP genes were upregulated in 61 % of patients with AML. The majority of altered cases were expression changes measured by RNA sequencing. Expressions of critical PPP genes such as G6PD, PFKL, PFKP, and PGLS were consistently upregulated in all altered cases. Altered PPP is not associated with survival or disease relapse. PPP inhibition using 6-aminonicotinamide (6AN) increases glucose oxidative metabolism in AML. 6AN decreased the glucose oxidation and increased fatty acid oxidation. Here, we showed that PPP inhibition increased glucose oxidative metabolism in AML. PPP inhibition suppressed growth, migration, and invasion of AML, but not colony formation. PPP plays an important role in AML.

ALV infection has become endemic in China and has a significant negative effect on the poultry industry. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a specific, sensitive and rapid method for diagnosis and eradication of ALV. Therefore, we developed a simple and rapid real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction for the timely detection of the common ALV subgroups, whereby the amplification can be obtained in 35 min under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C, ability to specific, sensitive and rapid detect all the common ALV subgroups. METHODS: A set of four specific primers was designed to target the sequences of the pol gene of ALV, and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay were developed and compared with PCR and virus isolation methods. RESULTS: The results from specificity of the LAMP assay showed that only target ALVs DNA was amplified. The LAMP assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 20 copies/reaction of ALV DNA, which was 10 times higher than the conventional PCR measurement. To further evaluate the reliability of the method, the assay was evaluated with ALV DNA from a panel of 81 clinical samples suspected of ALV infection. The results verify that the LAMP method was more sensitive than the conventional PCR and virus isolation method. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the developed LAMP assay was a simple, inexpensive, sensitive method for the rapid detection of the most common subgroups of ALV, and it provided a useful and practical tool in the eradication program for ALV in the poultry industry.","['Peng, Hao', 'Qin, Lili', 'Bi, Yuyu', 'Wang, Peikun', 'Zou, Guangzhen', 'Li, Jun', 'Yang, Yongli', 'Zhong, Xingfu', 'Wei, Ping']","['Peng H', 'Qin L', 'Bi Y', 'Wang P', 'Zou G', 'Li J', 'Yang Y', 'Zhong X', 'Wei P']","['Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. hpeng2006@163.com.', 'Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Vaccines and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai Bei Road, Nanning, 530001, China. hpeng2006@163.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. 544864700@qq.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. 452028926@qq.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. 976921735@qq.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. 1085847864@qq.com.', 'Guangxi Key Laboratory of Animal Vaccines and Diagnostics, Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute, 51 Youai Bei Road, Nanning, 530001, China. jlee9981@163.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. 1184397684@qq.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. 396263342@qq.com.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China. pingwei8@126.com.']",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151124,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*diagnosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*genetics', 'Chickens', 'China', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Veterinary Medicine/methods']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/30 06:00,['2015/11/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-015-0430-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-015-0430-1 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2015 Nov 24;12:195. doi: 10.1186/s12985-015-0430-1.,,PMC4657318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some cases of sudden hearing loss in CML may be improved or even cured by leukapheresis and intrathecal chemotherapy. The proposed pathogenesis for deafness in leukemia is due to hyperleukocytosis, hyperviscosity syndrome, leukemic infiltration and the inner ear hemorrhage. In treatment, clinicians should quickly reduce the number of white blood cells to lighten the tumor burden.

Contrary to the prevailing view, we found by conditional deletion of the key ILC3 genes Stat3, Il22, Tbx21 and Mcl1 that NCR(+) ILC3 cells were redundant for the control of mouse colonic infection with Citrobacter rodentium in the presence of T cells.

While loss-of-function mutations in DNMT3A are highly recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNMT3A mutations are almost never found in AML patients with translocations that create oncogenic fusion genes such as PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and MLL-AF9. Here, we explored how DNMT3A is involved in the function of these fusion genes. We used retroviral vectors to express PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, or MLL-AF9 in bone marrow cells derived from WT or DNMT3A-deficient mice. Additionally, we examined the phenotypes of hematopoietic cells from Ctsg-PML-RARA mice, which express PML-RARA in early hematopoietic progenitors and myeloid precursors, with or without DNMT3A. We determined that the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, is required for aberrant PML-RARA-driven self-renewal ex vivo and that DNMT3A is dispensable for RUNX1-RUNX1T1- and MLL-AF9-driven self-renewal. Furthermore, both the PML-RARA-driven competitive transplantation advantage and development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) required DNMT3A. Together, these findings suggest that PML-RARA requires DNMT3A to initiate APL in mice.","['Cole, Christopher B', 'Verdoni, Angela M', 'Ketkar, Shamika', 'Leight, Elizabeth R', 'Russler-Germain, David A', 'Lamprecht, Tamara L', 'Demeter, Ryan T', 'Magrini, Vincent', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Cole CB', 'Verdoni AM', 'Ketkar S', 'Leight ER', 'Russler-Germain DA', 'Lamprecht TL', 'Demeter RT', 'Magrini V', 'Ley TJ']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151123,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/physiology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['82897 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI82897 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Jan;126(1):85-98. doi: 10.1172/JCI82897.

Exposure to rubratoxin B for 24h induced secretion of each CCR5 chemokine, although the effect on CCL5 secretion was modest, and it enhanced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CXCL8, and CCL2. Concomitant treatment with radicicol abolished the rubratoxin-induced secretion of all cytokines investigated. Geldanamycin antagonized the rubratoxin B-induced effects on CCL3 and CCL5, but not CCL4; the effects of geldanamycin were less than that of radicicol.

The aim of this study is to explore the within- and between-country variability of cancer incidence to motivate high-quality ecologic studies. We extracted age-standardized incidence rate estimates (world standard population) from 135 regions for the ten most frequent invasive cancers in Europe for non-Hispanic white populations from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, Volume X. We fitted weighted multilevel Poisson regression models with random country effects for each cancer and sex. We estimated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A high ICC indicates a low within- and a high between-country variability of rates. The two cancer sites with the highest ICC among men were prostate cancer (0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99) and skin melanoma (0.78, 0.64-0.93). Among women, high ICCs were observed for lung cancer (0.84, 0.73-0.95) and breast cancer (0.80, 0.69-0.91). The two most prominent sex differences for ICC occurred for cancers of the head and neck (men: 0.70, 0.55-0.85, women: 0.19, 0.08-0.30) and breast cancer (men: 0.04, 0.01-0.07, women: 0.80, 0.69-0.91). ICCs were relatively low for pancreatic cancer (men: 0.23, 0.10-0.35; women: 0.13, 0.04-0.21) and leukemia (men: 0.12, 0.04-0.21; women: 0.08, 0.02-0.14).

In vitro studies of oogenesis are limited primarily because of the paucity of their source, first trimester fetal gonads, and the small number of germ lineage precursor cells present within these tissues. In order to understand this obscure but vitally important process, the present study was designed to direct differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into germ lineage cells. For this purpose, buffalo ES cells were differentiated, as embryoid bodies (EBs) and monolayer adherent cultures, in the presence of different concentrations of cumulus-conditioned medium (CCM; 10%, 20% and 40%) for different periods of culture (4, 8 and 14 days) to identify the optimum differentiation-inducing concentration and time. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that 20%-40% CCM induced the highest expression of primordial germ cell-specific (deleted in Azoospermia- like (Dazl), dead (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 4 (Vasa also known as DDX4) and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (Plzf)); meiotic (synaptonemal complex protein 3 (Sycp3), mutl homolog I (Mlh1), transition protein 1/2 (Tnp1/2) and protamine 2 (Prm2); spermatocyte-specific boule-like RNA binding protein (Boule) and tektin 1 (Tekt1)) and oocyte-specific growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9) and zona pellucida 2 /3 (Zp2/3)) genes over 8-14 days in culture. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed expression of primordial germ cell (c-KIT, DAZL and VASA), meiotic (SYCP3, MLH1 and PROTAMINE 1), spermatocyte (ACROSIN and HAPRIN) and oocyte (GDF9 and ZP4) markers in both EBs and monolayer differentiation cultures. Western blotting revealed germ lineage-specific protein expression in Day 14 EBs. The significantly lower (P<0.05) concentration of 5-methyl-2-deoxycytidine in differentiated EBs compared to undifferentiated EBs suggests that methylation erasure may have occurred.

However, the mechanism underlying these improved therapeutic effects has not yet been elucidated. It has previously been shown that PC-SOD localizes on the plasma membrane and in the lysosomes of cells. In this study, we evaluated the superoxide anion-scavenging activity of PC-SOD in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Compared to SOD, PC-SOD had only 17% scavenging activity in cell-free systems. Nevertheless, by analyzing enzyme activities in cell suspensions containing PC-SOD or SOD, PC-SOD and SOD showed almost equal activity for scavenging extracellular superoxide anions produced by HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the activity for scavenging extracellular superoxide anions increased with increased amount of PC-SOD on the plasma membrane. Moreover, PC-SOD exhibited no obvious inhibitory effect on the scavenging of intracellular superoxide anions. These results suggested that the association of PC-SOD with the plasma membrane plays a key role in its beneficial therapeutic effects. Thus, this finding may provide a rationale for selecting target diseases for PC-SOD treatment.","['Ishihara, Tsutomu', 'Shibui, Misaki', 'Hoshi, Takaya', 'Mizushima, Tohru']","['Ishihara T', 'Shibui M', 'Hoshi T', 'Mizushima T']","['Department of Chemical Biology and Applied Chemistry, College of Engineering, Nihon University, 1 Nakagawara, Tokusada, Tamuramachi, Koriyama, Fukushima 963-8642, Japan. ishihara@chem.ce.nihon-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Chemical Biology and Applied Chemistry, College of Engineering, Nihon University, 1 Nakagawara, Tokusada, Tamuramachi, Koriyama, Fukushima 963-8642, Japan. ishihara@chem.ce.nihon-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Chemical Biology and Applied Chemistry, College of Engineering, Nihon University, 1 Nakagawara, Tokusada, Tamuramachi, Koriyama, Fukushima 963-8642, Japan. ishihara@chem.ce.nihon-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Biosyst,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (lecithinized superoxide dismutase)']",IM,"['Anions/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5mb00631g [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biosyst. 2016 Jan;12(1):274-82. doi: 10.1039/c5mb00631g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that AML driven by repressive transcription factors, including AML1-ETO (encoded by the fusion oncogene RUNX1-RUNX1T1) and PML-RARalpha fusion oncoproteins (encoded by PML-RARA) are extremely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition, in part owing to their suppressed expression of key homologous recombination (HR)-associated genes and their compromised DNA-damage response (DDR). In contrast, leukemia driven by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, encoded by KMT2A) fusions with dominant transactivation ability is proficient in DDR and insensitive to PARP inhibition. Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of an MLL downstream target, HOXA9, which activates expression of various HR-associated genes, impairs DDR and sensitizes MLL leukemia to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Conversely, HOXA9 overexpression confers PARPi resistance to AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha transformed cells. Together, these studies describe a potential utility of PARPi-induced synthetic lethality for leukemia treatment and reveal a novel molecular mechanism governing PARPi sensitivity in AML.","['Esposito, Maria Teresa', 'Zhao, Lu', 'Fung, Tsz Kan', 'Rane, Jayant K', 'Wilson, Amanda', 'Martin, Nadine', 'Gil, Jesus', 'Leung, Anskar Y', 'Ashworth, Alan', 'So, Chi Wai Eric']","['Esposito MT', 'Zhao L', 'Fung TK', 'Rane JK', 'Wilson A', 'Martin N', 'Gil J', 'Leung AY', 'Ashworth A', 'So CW']","[""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Cell Proliferation Group, Medical Research Council Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Cell Proliferation Group, Medical Research Council Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, California, USA.', ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151123,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'WOH1JD9AR8 (olaparib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Phthalazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.3993 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.3993 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2015 Dec;21(12):1481-90. doi: 10.1038/nm.3993.

This fermented food product is made from vegetables, fruits, seaweeds and mushrooms, using 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. OM-X(R) is also known to have beneficial health properties, and some of its components show effects on antigen (Ag)-stimulated degranulation activity, indicating that OM-X(R) may be useful in the treatment of allergy responses and symptoms. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of OM-X(R) on Ag-stimulated degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, clarified the underlying mechanisms, and determined the active compounds in OM-X(R) for suppression of degranulation. Treatment with OM-X(R) gradually suppressed Ag-stimulated degranulation throughout the maturation period. OM-X(R) also gradually produced melanoidins by lactic acid bacterial fermentation during the maturation process. There was a high correlation between the suppression levels of Ag-stimulated degranulation and the browning of OM-X(R). Furthermore, the inhibition of Ag-stimulated degranulation by OM-X(R) was found to be partially due to the direct inactivation of NADPH oxidase.

GLO I catalyzes the reaction to transform hemimercaptal, a compound formed from methylglyoxal (MG) and reduced glutathione, into S-D-lactoylglutathione, which is then converted to D-lactic acid by glyoxalase II. GLO I inhibitors are expected to be useful for inhibiting tumorigenesis through the accumulation of apoptosis-inducible MG in tumor cells. Here, we investigated the anti-proliferative activity of eight kinds of isoflavone isolated from Erythrina poeppigiana against the growth of HL-60 human leukemia cells from the viewpoint of GLO I inhibition. Of the compounds tested, the diprenyl isoflavone, isolupalbigenin, was shown to exhibit the highest anti-proliferative activity against HL-60 cells. Upon the treatment of HL-60 cells with isolupalbigenin, MG was significantly accumulated in the culture medium, and the caspase 3 activity of the cell lysate was elevated in a time-dependent manner. Thus, it is suggested that isolupalbigenin inhibits the enzyme GLO I, resulting in MG accumulation in the medium, and leading to cell apoptosis. Isolupalbigenin, with two prenyl groups in its A- and B-rings, might be expected to become a potent leading compound for the development of anticancer agents.","['Hikita, Kiyomi', 'Yamada, Saori', 'Shibata, Rina', 'Katoh, Miyako', 'Murata, Tomiyasu', 'Kato, Kuniki', 'Tanaka, Hitoshi', 'Kaneda, Norio']","['Hikita K', 'Yamada S', 'Shibata R', 'Katoh M', 'Murata T', 'Kato K', 'Tanaka H', 'Kaneda N']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Nat Prod Commun,Natural product communications,101477873,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (GLO1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Erythrina/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nat Prod Commun. 2015 Sep;10(9):1581-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What are the late effects of childhood cancer therapy? A systematic review by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) provides useful information based on European and North American data. Cancer treatments can have many long-term consequences that depend on the drugs and doses used, radiation therapy protocols and irradiated organs, and age at the time of treatment. Cytotoxic drugs and radiation can both cause infertility. Abdominopelvic radiation therapy in girls has been linked to an increased risk of premature delivery and other complications of pregnancy. No increase in birth defects has been reported among children born to childhood cancer survivors. Anthracyclines and radiation therapy can cause cardiomyopathy. Neck irradiation can lead to thyroid disorders, and cranial irradiation to growth retardation. Chemotherapy can cause osteonecrosis and loss of bone density, but without an increased risk of fracture. The risk of cognitive impairment and structural abnormalities of the brain is higher when the child is younger or receives a high cumulative dose of cranial irradiation or total irradiation dosage. Some cytotoxic drugs can damage the kidneys. Cranial radiation therapy can cause long-term neuroendocrine disorders and growth disorders, especially when the dose exceeds 18 Gy. Cytotoxic drugs (alkylating agents, etoposide, etc.) and radiation therapy can cause second cancers of a different histological type. One analysis of second cancers showed a median time to onset of 7 years for solid tumours and 2.5 years for lymphoma and leukaemia. Better knowledge of the late effects of childhood cancer therapy can help orient the choice of treatment towards less harmful options or, if necessary, implement measures aimed at preventing late adverse effects. Childhood cancer survivors must be monitored into adulthood in order to detect such effects.",,,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Prescrire Int,Prescrire international,9439295,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cardiomyopathies/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Endocrine System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fertility/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/01/08 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Prescrire Int. 2015 Oct;24(164):236-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is of great interest to explore novel therapeutic strategies to obtain long-term remission. Immune effector cells, and especially natural killer (NK) cells, play a crucial role in the control of hematological malignancies. In this regard, the efficiency of allogeneic stem cell transplantation clearly depends on the immune-mediated graft versus leukemia effect without the risk of inducing graft versus host disease. Alloreactive donor NK cells generated following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ameliorate the outcome of leukemia patients; in addition, in vivo transfer of in vitro expanded NK cells represents a crucial tool for leukemia treatment. To improve NK cell effector functions against resistant leukemia cells, novel immunotherapeutic strategies are oriented to the identification, isolation, expansion, and administration of particular NK cell subsets endowed with multifunctional anti-tumor potential and tropism toward tumor sites. Moreover, the relationship between the emergence and persistence of distinct NK cell subsets during post-graft reconstitution and the maintenance of a remission state is still rather unclear.","['Gismondi, Angela', 'Stabile, Helena', 'Nisti, Paolo', 'Santoni, Angela']","['Gismondi A', 'Stabile H', 'Nisti P', 'Santoni A']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy ; Eleonora Lorillard Spencer Cenci Foundation , Rome , Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy ; Italian Institute of Technology , Rome , Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151105,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2015/11/26 06:00,2015/11/26 06:01,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2015.00567 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2015 Nov 5;6:567. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00567. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4633523,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HSCT', 'NK cell subsets', 'NK cell therapy', 'NK cells', 'hematological malignancies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvement of knowledge regarding the biology of natural killer (NK) cells and technical advances leads to the generation of high dimensional dataset. High dimensional flow cytometry requires tools adapted to complex dataset analyses. This study presents an example of NK cell maturation analysis in Healthy Volunteers (HV) and patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with an automated procedure using the FLOCK algorithm. This procedure enabled to automatically identify NK cell subsets according to maturation profiles, with 2D mapping of a four-dimensional dataset. Differences were highlighted in AML patients compared to HV, with an overall increase of NK maturation. Among patients, a strong heterogeneity in NK cell maturation defined three distinct profiles. Overall, automatic gating with FLOCK algorithm is a recent procedure, which enables fast and reliable identification of cell populations from high-dimensional cytometry data. Such tools are necessary for immune subset characterization and standardization of data analyses. This tool is adapted to new immune cell subsets discovery, and may lead to a better knowledge of NK cell defects in cancer patients.

We and others showed that the well-known BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia, induced an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and conferred therapeutic drug resistance by suppression of apoptotic signaling, prolonged G2/M arrest and stimulation of several pathways of DNA repair. However, to protect from apoptosis, cancer cells may tolerate some DNA lesions, which may increase genomic instability. Moreover, BCR/ABL1-stimulated DNA repair might be faulty, especially non-homologous end joining in its alternative forms. Normal DNA repair can remove DNA damage and prevent mutations, reducing genome instability, but on the other hand, due to its imprecise nature, it may increase genomic instability by increasing the ratio of mutagenic DNA lesions. The example of BCR-ABL1-expressing cells shows that DNA repair can both increase and decrease genomic instability of cancer cells and understanding the mechanism of the regulation of these opposite effects would be helpful in anticancer strategies.","['Pawlowska, Elzbieta', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Pawlowska E', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Orthodontics, Medical University of Lodz, 92-216 Lodz, Poland. elzbieta.pawlowska@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, 90-236 Lodz, Poland. jblasiak@biol.uni.lodz.pl.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151118,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms161126049 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms161126049 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2015 Nov 18;16(11):27535-49. doi: 10.3390/ijms161126049.,,PMC4661907,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'DNA repair', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'genomic instability']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One key pathway that counteracts replication stress and promotes faithful DNA replication consists of the Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins. However, how these proteins limit replication stress remains largely elusive. Here we show that conflicts between replication and transcription activate the FA pathway. Inhibition of transcription or enzymatic degradation of transcription-associated R-loops (DNA:RNA hybrids) suppresses replication fork arrest and DNA damage occurring in the absence of a functional FA pathway. Furthermore, we show that simple aldehydes, known to cause leukemia in FA-deficient mice, induce DNA:RNA hybrids in FA-depleted cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the molecular mechanism by which the FA pathway limits R-loop accumulation requires FANCM translocase activity. Failure to activate a response to physiologically occurring DNA:RNA hybrids may critically contribute to the heightened cancer predisposition and bone marrow failure of individuals with mutated FA proteins.","['Schwab, Rebekka A', 'Nieminuszczy, Jadwiga', 'Shah, Fenil', 'Langton, Jamie', 'Lopez Martinez, David', 'Liang, Chih-Chao', 'Cohn, Martin A', 'Gibbons, Richard J', 'Deans, Andrew J', 'Niedzwiedz, Wojciech']","['Schwab RA', 'Nieminuszczy J', 'Shah F', 'Langton J', 'Lopez Martinez D', 'Liang CC', 'Cohn MA', 'Gibbons RJ', 'Deans AJ', 'Niedzwiedz W']","['Department of Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', ""Genome Stability Unit, St. Vincent's Institute, Fitzroy, VIC 3065, Australia."", 'Department of Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', ""Genome Stability Unit, St. Vincent's Institute, Fitzroy, VIC 3065, Australia."", 'Department of Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.

In most cases, MLL fuses with a gene encoding a component of the AEP (AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb) coactivator complex. MLL-AEP fusion proteins constitutively activate their target genes to immortalize haematopoietic progenitors. Here we show that AEP and MLL-AEP fusion proteins activate transcription through selectivity factor 1 (SL1), a core component of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) of RNA polymerase I (RNAP1). The pSER domain of AF4 family proteins associates with SL1 on chromatin and loads TATA-binding protein (TBP) onto the promoter to initiate RNA polymerase II (RNAP2)-dependent transcription. These results reveal a previously unknown transcription initiation mechanism involving AEP and a role for SL1 as a TBP-loading factor in RNAP2-dependent gene activation.","['Okuda, Hiroshi', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Ito, Shinji', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko']","['Okuda H', 'Kanai A', 'Ito S', 'Matsui H', 'Yokoyama A']","['Laboratory for Malignancy Control Research, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Medical Research Support Center, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Yoshidakonoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Malignancy Control Research, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151123,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (TAF1B protein, human)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase I/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/06/29 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms9869 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms9869 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2015 Nov 23;6:8869. doi: 10.1038/ncomms9869.,,PMC4673504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small molecule compound DAP (2,2-dichloroacetophenone) is a potent inhibitor of PDK1. Whether targeting PDK1 with DAP can inhibit acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and how it works remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of inhibition of PDK1 with DAP on cell growth, apoptosis and survival in AML cells and identified the underlying mechanisms. We found that treatment with DAP significantly inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis induction and suppressed autophagy in AML cells in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in an AML mouse model in vivo. We also showed that inhibition of PDK1 with DAP increased the cleavage of pro-apoptotic proteins (PARP and Caspase 3) and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-xL and BCL-2) and autophagy regulators (ULK1, Beclin-1 and Atg). In addition, we found that DAP inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDK1 interacted with ULK1, BCL-xL and E3 ligase CBL-b in AML cells, and DPA treatment could inhibit the interactions. Collectively, our results indicated that targeting PDK1 with DAP inhibited AML cell growth via multiple signaling pathways and suggest that targeting PDK1 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AMLs.","['Qin, Lijun', 'Tian, Yun', 'Yu, Zhenlong', 'Shi, Dingbo', 'Wang, Jingshu', 'Zhang, Changlin', 'Peng, Ruoyu', 'Chen, Xuezhen', 'Liu, Congcong', 'Chen, Yiming', 'Huang, Wenlin', 'Deng, Wuguo']","['Qin L', 'Tian Y', 'Yu Z', 'Shi D', 'Wang J', 'Zhang C', 'Peng R', 'Chen X', 'Liu C', 'Chen Y', 'Huang W', 'Deng W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", 'Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', ""Guangdong Provincial No. 2 People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Targeted Drug for Tumors of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Double Bioproduct Inc., Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Targeted Drug for Tumors of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Double Bioproduct Inc., Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (PDK1 protein, human)', '0 (Pdk1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', '3VJ32JJ8LH (2,2-dichloroacetophenone)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice, Hairless', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['6366 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6366 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jan 12;7(2):1395-407. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6366.,,PMC4811468,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BCL-xl', 'PDK1', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a limited efficacy of bortezomib alone has been reported. A terminal pro-apoptotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) is one of the several mechanisms of bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Recently, it has been documented that UPR disruption could be considered a selective anti-leukemia therapy. CX-4945, a potent casein kinase (CK) 2 inhibitor, has been found to induce apoptotic cell death in T-ALL preclinical models, via perturbation of ER/UPR pathway. In this study, we analyzed in T- and B-ALL preclinical settings, the molecular mechanisms of synergistic apoptotic effects observed after bortezomib/CX-4945 combined treatment. We demonstrated that, adding CX-4945 after bortezomib treatment, prevented leukemic cells from engaging a functional UPR in order to buffer the bortezomib-mediated proteotoxic stress in ER lumen. We documented that the combined treatment decreased pro-survival ER chaperon BIP/Grp78 expression, via reduction of chaperoning activity of Hsp90. Bortezomib/CX-4945 treatment inhibited NF-kappaB signaling in T-ALL cell lines and primary cells from T-ALL patients, but, intriguingly, in B-ALL cells the drug combination activated NF-kappaB p65 pro-apoptotic functions. In fact in B-cells, the combined treatment induced p65-HDAC1 association with consequent repression of the anti-apoptotic target genes, Bcl-xL and XIAP. Exposure to NEMO (IKKgamma)-binding domain inhibitor peptide reduced the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib/CX-4945 treatment. Overall, our findings demonstrated that CK2 inhibition could be useful in combination with bortezomib as a novel therapeutic strategy in both T- and B-ALL.","['Buontempo, Francesca', 'Orsini, Ester', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Bertacchini, Jessika', 'Neri, Luca Maria', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria']","['Buontempo F', 'Orsini E', 'Lonetti A', 'Cappellini A', 'Chiarini F', 'Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Melchionda F', 'Pession A', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'Bertacchini J', 'Neri LM', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit ""Lalla Seragnoli"", S.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of apoptosis induced by epigarcinol and isogarcinol isolated from the root of Garcinia ovalifolia (Clusiaceae) on human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60 cells). METHODS: Epigarcinol and isogarcinol were isolated from the root of G. ovalifolia by using column chromatography method. The antiproliferative property of these molecules and fractions were assessed with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The light fluorescence microscope was utilized to observe the morphological changes of HL-60 cells after 24 h treatment. Early apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by using flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The results showed that epigarcinol and isogarcinol inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 and PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 varying between 4 and 76 microg/mL depending on the cell line and the molecule. The apoptosis rate and the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased with the augmentation of the concentration of the molecules. The results of flow cytometry (FCM) indicated that epigarcinol and isogarcinol induced significant G2/S arrest of HL-60 cells, the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that epigarcinol and isogarcinol demonstrated in vitro antiproliferative properties and induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells which is related to the G2/S arrest, and it exerts its apoptotic effect through the loosing of mitochondrial membrane potential.","['Pieme, Constant Anatole', 'Ambassa, Pathaleon', 'Yankep, Emmanuel', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar']","['Pieme CA', 'Ambassa P', 'Yankep E', 'Saxena AK']","['Department of Physiological Sciences and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde I, PO Box 1364, Yaounde, Cameroon. apieme@yahoo.fr.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, 180001, Canal Road, Jammu, India. apieme@yahoo.fr.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, 180001, Canal Road, Jammu, India. ambassapantaleon@yahoo.fr.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Yaounde I, PO Box 812, Yaounde, Cameroon. ambassapantaleon@yahoo.fr.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Yaounde I, PO Box 812, Yaounde, Cameroon. conanpieme@gmail.com.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, 180001, Canal Road, Jammu, India. aksaxena@iiim.ac.in.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151123,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Terpenes)', 'TR1VR1V71B (garcinol)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Garcinia', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', '*Plant Roots', 'Terpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-015-1596-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-015-1596-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2015 Nov 23;8:700. doi: 10.1186/s13104-015-1596-8.,,PMC4656183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of ACBPs on human colorectal cancer and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Cell growth and apoptosis of human colorectal tumor cell line HCT116 were measured using cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of PARP, p53 and Mcl1A were assessed with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. For evaluation of the in vivo antitumor activity of ACBPs, HCT116 xenograft nude mice were treated with ACBPs (35 mug/mL, ip) for 10 days. RESULTS: Treatment of HCT116 cells with ACBPs (35 mug/mL) for 4-6 days significantly inhibited the cell growth. Furthermore, treatment of HCT116 cells with ACBPs (35 mug/mL) for 6-12 h significantly enhanced UV-induced apoptosis, increased the expression of PARP and p53, and decreased the expression of Mcl-1. Administration of ACBPs did not change the body weight of HCT116 xenograft nude mice, but decreased the tumor growth by approximately 43%, and increased the expression of PARP and p53, and decreased the expression of Mcl-1 in xenograft mouse tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Administration of ACBPs inhibits human colorectal tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo through modulating the PARP-p53-Mcl-1 signaling pathway.","['Su, Li-ya', 'Shi, Ying-xu', 'Yan, Mei-rong', 'Xi, Yaguang', 'Su, Xiu-lan']","['Su LY', 'Shi YX', 'Yan MR', 'Xi Y', 'Su XL']","['Clinical Medicine Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010050, China.', 'Clinical Medicine Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010050, China.', 'Clinical Medicine Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010050, China.', 'University of South Alabama Mitchell Cancer Institute, Mobile, AL 36604, USA.', 'Clinical Medicine Research Center of the Affiliated Hospital, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010050, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151123,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colon/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Peptides/*therapeutic use', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Rectum/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/08/19 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201580 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2015.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2015 Dec;36(12):1514-9. doi: 10.1038/aps.2015.80.

Therefore, regulation of AML cell trafficking and adhesion to the bone marrow is of significant interest. In this study, we demonstrate that differential expression of the membrane scaffold CD82 modulates the bone marrow homing of AML cells. By combining mutational analysis and super-resolution imaging, we identify membrane protein clustering by CD82 as a regulator of AML cell adhesion and bone marrow homing. Cluster analysis of super-resolution data indicates that N-linked glycosylation and palmitoylation of CD82 are both critical modifications that control the microdomain organization of CD82 as well as the nanoscale clustering of associated adhesion protein, N-cadherin. We demonstrate that the inhibition of CD82 glycosylation increases the molecular packing of N-cadherin and promotes the bone marrow homing of AML cells. In contrast, we find that the inhibition of CD82 palmitoylation disrupts the formation and organization of N-cadherin clusters and significantly diminishes bone marrow trafficking of AML. Taken together, these data establish a mechanism where the membrane organization of CD82, through specific posttranslational modifications, regulates N-cadherin clustering and membrane density, which impacts the in vivo trafficking of AML cells. As such, these observations provide an alternative model for targeting AML where modulation of protein organization within the membrane may be an effective treatment therapy to disrupt the bone marrow homing potential of AML cells.","['Marjon, K D', 'Termini, C M', 'Karlen, K L', 'Saito-Reis, C', 'Soria, C E', 'Lidke, K A', 'Gillette, J M']","['Marjon KD', 'Termini CM', 'Karlen KL', 'Saito-Reis C', 'Soria CE', 'Lidke KA', 'Gillette JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151123,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (CDH2 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cadherins/*chemistry', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Kangai-1 Protein/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipoylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, CXCR4/physiology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2015449 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.449 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Aug 4;35(31):4132-40. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.449.

In certain situations like septic shock, hip surgery, coronary disease or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a restrictive transfusion strategy is associated with a reduction of infection and death. A transfusion strategy using a single PRBC unit has been retrospectively investigated and showed a safe reduction of PRBC consumption and costs. We therefore designed a study to prospectively demonstrate that the transfusion of a single PRBC unit is safe and not inferior to standard care. METHODS: The 1versus2 trial is a randomized trial which will determine if a single-unit transfusion policy is not inferior to a double-unit transfusion policy. The primary endpoint is the incidence of severe complication (grade >/= 3) defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, elevated troponin level, intensive care unit transfer, death, new pulmonary infiltrates, and transfusion-related infections during hospital stays. The secondary endpoint is the number of PRBC units transfused per patient per hospital stay. Two hundred and thirty patients will be randomized to receive a single unit or double unit every time the hemoglobin level is less than 8 g/dL. All patients admitted for induction remission chemotherapy, auto-HSCT or allo-HSCT in hematology intensive care units will be eligible for inclusion. Sample size calculation has determined that a patient population of 230 will be required to prove that the 1-unit PRBC strategy is non-inferior to the 2-unit PRBC strategy. Hemoglobin threshold for transfusion is below 8 g/dL. Estimated percentage of complication-free hospital stays is 93 %. In a non-inferiority hypothesis, the number of patients to include is 230 with a power of 90 % and an alpha risk of 5 %.

The induction of spontaneous apoptosis observed in multiple EZH2-silenced leukemic cell lines was assessed by flow cytometry, and levels of Wnt/beta-catenin-related expression were determined by western blot analysis. In comparison with AML control cells, EZH2-knockdown cells exhibited increased apoptosis and significant downregulation of beta-catenin expression, as well as decreases in GSK-3beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin activation (p < 0.05 for all measurements). Additionally, EZH2 knockdown sensitized AML cells to induced cell death following administration of chemotherapeutic ATO. Our results suggested that EZH2 in leukemic cell lines might inhibit ATO-induced apoptosis and that EZH2 may be a potential therapeutic target in AML patients undergoing ATO treatment. Our findings provide new insights into the role of ATO and EZH2 in regulating AML progression.","['Zhang, Hao', 'Gu, Huizi', 'Li, Limei', 'Ren, Yuan', 'Zhang, Lijun']","['Zhang H', 'Gu H', 'Li L', 'Ren Y', 'Zhang L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, 110001.', 'Breast Disease and Reconstruction Center, Breast Cancer Key Lab of Dalian, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China, 116027.', 'Department of Neurology, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China, 116027.', ""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China, 110016."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, 110001.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, 110001. 13514201170@126.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151123,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects']",2015/11/26 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4463-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4463-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 May;37(5):5919-23. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4463-2.

In this study, the transcriptomic responses of B. pseudomallei infection of a human macrophage cell model were investigated using whole-genome microarrays. Gene expression profiles were compared between infected THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells with or without treatment with Daboia russelli russelli daboiatoxin (DRRDbTx) or ceftazidime (antibiotic control). Microarray analyses of infected and treated cells revealed differential upregulation of various inflammatory genes such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 4 (CXCL4), transcription factor p65 (NF-kB); and several genes involved in immune and stress responses, cell cycle, and lipid metabolism. Moreover, following DRR-DbTx treatment of infected cells, there was enhanced expression of the tolllike receptor 2 (TLR-2) mediated signaling pathway involved in recognition and initiation of acute inflammatory responses. Importantly, we observed that highly inflammatory cytokine gene responses were similar in infected cells exposed to DRR-DbTx or ceftazidime after 24 h. Additionally, there were increased transcripts associated with cell death by caspase activation that can promote host tissue injury. In summary, the transcriptional responses during B. pseudomallei infection of macrophages highlight a broad range of innate immune mechanisms that are activated within 24 h post-infection. These data provide insights into the transcriptomic kinetics following DRR-DbTx treatment of human macrophages infected with B. pseudomallei.","['Perumal Samy, R', 'Manikandan, J', 'Pachiappan, A', 'Ooi, E E', 'Aw, L T', 'Stiles, B G', 'Franco, O L', 'Kandasamy, M', 'Mathi, K M', 'Rane, G', 'Siveen, K S', 'Arunachalam, C', 'Zayed, M E', 'Alharbi, S A', 'Kumar, A P', 'Sethi, G', 'Lim, L H K', 'Chow, V T']","['Perumal Samy R', 'Manikandan J', 'Pachiappan A', 'Ooi EE', 'Aw LT', 'Stiles BG', 'Franco OL', 'Kandasamy M', 'Mathi KM', 'Rane G', 'Siveen KS', 'Arunachalam C', 'Zayed ME', 'Alharbi SA', 'Kumar AP', 'Sethi G', 'Lim LH', 'Chow VT']","['Department of Physiology, NUS Immunology Programme, Centre for Life Sciences, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, 117456, Singapore. phsrp@nus.edu.sg.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Viper Venoms)', '0 (daboiatoxin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkholderia pseudomallei/*drug effects/growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Ceftazidime/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Microarray Analysis', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Platelet Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism', 'Viper Venoms/*chemistry', 'Viperidae']",2015/11/26 06:00,2016/09/09 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['CMM-EPUB-72044 [pii]', '10.2174/1566524016666151123114123 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2015;15(10):961-74. doi: 10.2174/1566524016666151123114123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its functional molecular mechanism remained unclear. In this experiment, the authors conducted a systematic study on the effect of CPT on the imatinib sensitivity and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in CML cells by using CML cells K562 and imatinib persister K562-R. The MTT assays were performed to determine CPT's impact on the inhibitory effect of imatinib. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining analysis was used to detect the changes in the cell apoptosis rate. The active changes in apoptosis regulatory proteins Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and PARP were determined by Western blot. After the cells were pretreated with the gradient concentration of CPT, the expression of P-gp was analyzed by Western blot and flow cytometry. The changes in intracellular concentrations of imatinib were determined by HPLC analysis. The results indicated that the pretreatment with CPT significantly increased the proliferation inhibiting and apoptosis inducing effects of imatinib on K562 and K562-R cells as well as the degradation product expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and PARP, with a significant difference with the control group (P < 0.01). However, CPT showed no impact on the P-gp expression in CML cells and the intracellular concentrations of imatinib. In summary, the findings suggested that CPT enhanced the sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib. Its mechanism is not dependent on the inhibition in P-gp expression and the increase in intracellular drug concentration.","['Ge, Yu-qing', 'Cheng, Ru-bin', 'Yang, Bo', 'Huang, Zhen', 'Chen, Zhe']","['Ge YQ', 'Cheng RB', 'Yang B', 'Huang Z', 'Chen Z']",,,['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '5E9SXT166N (cryptotanshinone)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology']",2015/11/26 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/11/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2015 Jun;40(12):2389-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that RUNX1, a transcription factor that regulates normal hematopoiesis, is up-regulated in patients with FLT3/ITD(+) AML. While RUNX1 can function as a tumor suppressor, recent data have shown that RUNX1 is required for AML cell survival. In the present study, we investigated the functional role of RUNX1 in FLT3/ITD signaling. FLT3/ITD induced growth factor-independent proliferation and impaired G-CSF mediated myeloid differentiation in 32D hematopoietic cells, coincident with up-regulation of RUNX1 expression. Silencing of RUNX1 expression significantly decreased proliferation and secondary colony formation, and partially abrogated the impaired myeloid differentiation of FLT3/ITD(+) 32D cells. Although the number of FLT3/ITD(+) 32D cells declined after incubation with the FLT3/ITD inhibitor AC220, the cells became refractory to AC220, concomitant with up-regulation of RUNX1. Silencing of RUNX1 abrogated the emergence and proliferation of AC220-resistant FLT3/ITD(+) 32D cells in the presence of AC220. Our data indicate that FLT3/ITD deregulates cell proliferation and differentiation and confers resistance to AC220 by up-regulating RUNX1 expression. These findings suggest an oncogenic role for RUNX1 in FLT3/ITD(+) cells and that inhibition of RUNX1 function represents a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with refractory FLT3/ITD(+) AML.","['Hirade, Tomohiro', 'Abe, Mariko', 'Onishi, Chie', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Yamaguchi, Seiji', 'Fukuda, Seiji']","['Hirade T', 'Abe M', 'Onishi C', 'Taketani T', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Fukuda S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enya-cho, Izumo, Shimane, 693-8501, Japan. hirade25@med.shimane-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enya-cho, Izumo, Shimane, 693-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enya-cho, Izumo, Shimane, 693-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enya-cho, Izumo, Shimane, 693-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enya-cho, Izumo, Shimane, 693-8501, Japan. sfukuda@med.shimane-u.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151121,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Duplication/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology']",2015/11/23 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2015/11/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1908-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1908-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Jan;103(1):95-106. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1908-8.

It is only logical that the finding of leukemic blast cells after therapy predicts for impending relapse or at least the need for additional treatment. Which level of what is called minimal residual disease (MRD) is clinically relevant, however, depends on the efficacy of the initial treatment as well as the treatment strategies available to target MRD. There are a multitude of additional factors that can alter the clinical significance of MRD, including the genotype of the patient's leukemic cells. The fact that methodologies of MRD detection are not standardized and thresholds for defining MRD positivity vary depending upon MRD detection method and the operator's skills or convictions only add to the complexity of MRD interpretation. While enormous efforts are devoted to enhancing the sensitivity of MRD detection, eg, by next-generation sequencing, improvements of methods for detecting MRD per se will not automatically lead to a more reliable estimation of total tumor burden. Most importantly, even the best assay will yield accurate MRD results only if the tissue source for MRD determination is of good quality. Another aspect of potentially crucial importance is the heterogenous distribution of leukemic cells throughout the skeleton after treatment, recently demonstrated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by bone marrow imaging.

This review will focus on AML relapse, and how a better understanding of the evolutionary stages that lead to relapse might help us improve disease outcome. The fact that the relapse rate for some AMLs is so high indicates that we do not truly understand the biology of relapse or possibly that we are not implementing our current understanding into, clinical practice. Therefore, this review will also aim to explore some of the current understanding of AML relapse biology in order to identify the gaps in our knowledge and translation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the root of relapse evolves even before the time of diagnosis, meaning that the complex clonal structure of AML is created before patients present to the clinic. Some of the clones that exist at diagnosis can survive chemotherapy and give rise to relapse. Accordingly, in order to better understand the mechanisms of relapse, we must consider both early and late steps in AML evolution.","['Shlush, Liran I', 'Mitchell, Amanda']","['Shlush LI', 'Mitchell A']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, Ont., Canada; Weizmann Institute of Science Rehovot, Israel.

Epigenetic modulation, intracellular pathways, and the microenvironment are all being explored for possible therapies to treat AML. Dramatic clinical progress has also been made in therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the rapid approval of blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager antibody.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HPIP-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the spinal glioblastoma have been under investigation. In the present study, spinal glioblastoma tissues, U87, and U251 cell lines were used and subjected to in vitro assays, such as RT-PCR, and Western blot. Here, in vitro assays revealed that HPIP mRNA and protein were highly expressed in five cases of spinal glioblastoma tissues, compared with non-tumor tissues. Subsequently, in vitro experiments demonstrated HPIP promoted the U87 and U251 cell growth and regulated the G1/S phase transitions in U87 and U251 cell cycle, respectively, accompanied by the increased expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1. Furthermore, HPIP increased the expression of N-cadherin, Slug, and MMP2, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin. By contrast, knockdown of HPIP reversed HPIP-induced EMT biomarkers, migration, and invasion in U87 and U251 cells. In conclusion, our findings identified HPIP plays an important role in the progression and EMT of spinal glioblastoma, by which cell growth is improved. Thus, HPIP gene or protein could act as a useful target in the clinical practice.","['Wang, Deliang', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Zhao, Xinjun', 'Xiong, Hui']","['Wang D', 'Wang L', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhao X', 'Xiong H']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Shandong University Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.16369, Jingshi Road, Jinan, 250014, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Gynaecology, Shandong University Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shandong University Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.16369, Jingshi Road, Jinan, 250014, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shandong University Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.16369, Jingshi Road, Jinan, 250014, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shandong University Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.16369, Jingshi Road, Jinan, 250014, Shandong, China. xionghtcm@126.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151121,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (PBXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Spinal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/23 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/11/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4453-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4453-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 May;37(5):5897-903. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4453-4.

T cell immunodeficiencies play important roles in the progression of leukemia. This study investigated the effect of CD4+ T cells from AML patients on the proliferation of BM-MSCs. METHODS: The growth rate of BM-MSCs from AML patients and healthy donor was compared. CD4+ T cells were separated and identified from AML patients. Through co-culturing CD4+ T cells from AML patients and BM-MSCs from healthy, we detected the proliferation of BM-MSCs from healthy by MTT assay. qRT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of miR-10a. Luciferase reporter assay was used to analyze the regulation of miR-10a on the expression of BCL6. RESULTS: Here, we observed that BM-MSC from AML patients grew slower than that from healthy. CD4+ T cells from AML patients inhibited the proliferation of BM-MSCs through secreting miR-10a. In addition, miR-10a was found to target BCL6 and regulated its expression in transcription and translation levels. Correlation analysis revealed that the level of miR-10a in serum of AML patients was negatively correlated with BCL6 in BM-MSC. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that CD4+ T cells from AML patients suppress the proliferation of BM-MSCs via secreting miR-10a.","['Yu, Zhen', 'Li, Dong', 'Ju, Xiu-li']","['Yu Z', 'Li D', 'Ju XL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 Wen Hua Xi Road, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 Wen Hua Xi Road, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, 107 Wen Hua Xi Road, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, People's Republic of China. jxiuli2015@163.com.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151121,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', '*CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2015/11/23 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2015/11/23 06:00'],"['2015/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-015-2076-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-2076-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Apr;142(4):733-40. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-2076-1.

However, despite thorough identification of mutations in solid tumors and hematological malignancies, how these mutations induce cell transformation still remains elusive. In addition, each tumor usually contains multiple mutations or sometimes consists of multiple clones, which makes functional analysis difficult. Fifteen years ago, it was proposed that combination of two types of mutations induce acute leukemia; Class I mutations induce cell growth or inhibit apoptosis while class II mutations block differentiation, co-operating in inducing acute leukemia. This notion has been proven using a variety of mouse models, however most of recently found mutations are not typical class I/II mutations. Although some novel mutations have been found to functionally work as class I or II mutation in leukemogenesis, the classical class I/II theory seems to be too simple to explain the whole story. We here overview the molecular basis of hematological malignancies based on clinical and experimental results, and propose a new working hypothesis for leukemogenesis.","['Kitamura, Toshio',

Prior studies on the genetics of osteonecrosis have focused on patients >/=10 years of age, leaving the genetic risk factors for the larger group of children <10 years incompletely understood. Here, we perform the first evaluation of genetic risk factors for osteonecrosis in children <10 years. The discovery cohort comprised 82 cases of osteonecrosis and 287 controls treated on Children's Oncology Group (COG) standard-risk ALL protocol AALL0331 (NCT00103285, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00103285), with results tested for replication in 817 children <10 years treated on COG protocol AALL0232 (NCT00075725, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00075725). The top replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were near bone morphogenic protein 7 [BMP7: rs75161997, P = 5.34 x 10(-8) (odds ratio [OR] 15.0) and P = .0498 (OR 8.44) in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively] and PROX1-antisense RNA1 (PROX1-AS1: rs1891059, P = 2.28 x 10(-7) [OR 6.48] and P = .0077 [OR 3.78] for the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively). The top replicated nonsynonymous SNP, rs34144324, was in a glutamate receptor gene (GRID2, P = 8.65 x 10(-6) [OR 3.46] and P = .0136 [OR 10.8] in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively). In a meta-analysis, the BMP7 and PROX1-AS1 variants (rs75161997 and rs1891059, respectively) met the significance threshold of <5 x 10(-8). Top replicated SNPs were enriched in enhancers active in mesenchymal stem cells, and analysis of annotated genes demonstrated enrichment in glutamate receptor and adipogenesis pathways. These data may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of osteonecrosis.","['Karol, Seth E', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Smith, Colton', 'Liu, ChengCheng', 'Ramsey, Laura B', 'Fernandez, Christian A', 'Chang, Tamara Y', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Mardis, Elaine', 'Fulton, Robert', 'Scheet, Paul', 'San Lucas, F Anthony', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Karol SE', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Yang W', 'Maloney KW', 'Smith C', 'Liu C', 'Ramsey LB', 'Fernandez CA', 'Chang TY', 'Neale G', 'Cheng C', 'Mardis E', 'Fulton R', 'Scheet P', 'San Lucas FA', 'Larsen EC', 'Loh ML', 'Raetz EA', 'Hunger SP', 'Devidas M', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'HARP Pharma Consulting, Mystic, CT;', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Denver, CO;"", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO;', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Maine Medical Center, Portland, ME;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine, Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;""]",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BMP7 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2015/11/22 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/11/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30492-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-10-673848 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Feb 4;127(5):558-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-10-673848.

In this study, iron hepta-tungsten phosphate oxygen clusters complex Na12H[Fe(HPW7O28)2].44H2O (IHTPO) was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activities on human hepatoma HepG2, leukemia K562, lung carcinoma A549, and large cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells, therapeutic efficacies on mice transplantable tumor, and immunomodulatory potentials on the immune response in tumor-bearing mice. IHTPO exhibited lower in vitro cytotoxic activities against four human tumor cell lines, with the IC50 values being higher than 62.5muM (ca. 300mug/ml). IHTPO, however, significantly inhibited the growth of S180 sarcoma transplanted in mice. It was further showed that IHTPO could not only significantly promote splenocytes proliferation, NK cell and CTL activity from splenocytes, but remarkably enhance serum antigen-specific IgG, IgG2a and IgG2b antibody levels in S180-bearing mice. IHTPO also significantly promoted Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2 production, and up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and Th1 transcription factors T-bet and STAT-4 in splenocytes from the S180-bearing mice. These results suggested that IHTPO significantly inhibited the growth of mice transplantable tumor, and that its in vivo antitumor activity might be achieved by improving Th1 protective cell-mediated immunity. IHTPO could act as antitumor agent with immunomodulatory activity.","['Zhang, Bisong', 'Qiu, Jianping', 'Wu, Changsheng', 'Li, Yunxia', 'Liu, Zhenxiang']","['Zhang B', 'Qiu J', 'Wu C', 'Li Y', 'Liu Z']","['Institute of Materia Medica, College of Pharmaceutics and Material Engineering, Jinhua Polytechnic, Jinhua 321000, China.

This retrospective analysis was performed to investigate whether allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation performed in first complete remission in patients with monosomal karyotype can overcome the adverse prognosis associated with these patients. Of the 4635 patients included in the study, 189 (4%) harbored a monosomal karyotype. The presence of a monosomal karyotype was associated with a worse outcome, with an inferior leukemia-free survival and overall survival (5-year leukemia-free survival and overall survival: 24 +/- 3% and 26 +/- 3% vs. 53 +/- 1% and 57 +/- 1% in monosomal-karyotype and non-monosomal-karyotype, respectively; P<0.0001) and higher relapse risk after transplantation (cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years: 56 +/- 4% in monosomal-karyotype vs. 28 +/- 1% in non-monosomal-karyotype; P<0.0001). The adverse negative impact of monosomal karyotype cytogenetics was confirmed in the entire cohort in a multivariate analysis [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.88, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.29-2.73, P=0.001 for relapse incidence; HR:1.71, 95%CI:1.27-2.32, P<0.0001 for leukemia-free survival; HR:1.81, 95%CI:1.32-2.48, P=0.0002 for overall survival], and was independent of the presence of other poor-risk cytogenetic subtypes. In summary, monosomal karyotype arises as a strong negative prognostic feature in acute myeloid leukemia also in patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission, stressing the need to develop additional pre- and post-transplantation strategies aimed at improving overall results. Nonetheless, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in early phase is currently the best therapy for this very poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia subtype.","['Brands-Nijenhuis, Angelique V M', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Malard, Florent', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Brands-Nijenhuis AV', 'Labopin M', 'Schouten HC', 'Volin L', 'Socie G', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Huynh A', 'Ljungman P', 'Malard F', 'Esteve J', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Catharina Ziekenhuis Eindhoven, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Eindhoven, the Netherlands.', 'EBMT Data Office Paris, Hospital Saint Antoine, Department of Hematology, France.', 'Maastricht University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Helsinki University Central Hospital, Department of Medicine, Finland.', 'Hospital St. Louis, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Hopital de Purpan CHU Department Hematologie Toulouse, France.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Hematology, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hospital Saint Antoine, Department of Hematology, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Clinic, Department of Hematology, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel EBMT Data Office Paris, Hospital Saint Antoine, Department of Hematology, France.', 'Hospital Saint Antoine, Department of Hematology, Paris, France mohamad.mohty@inserm.fr.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20151120,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy/*pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/22 06:00,2017/01/05 06:00,['2015/11/22 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.132654 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.132654 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Feb;101(2):248-55. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.132654.

Clinicians have taken advantage of this by adoptively transferring haploidentical NK cells into patients to mediate an effective graft-versus-leukemia response. With a similar rationale, antibody blockade of MHC class I-specific inhibitory NK cell receptors is currently being tested in clinical trials. Both approaches are challenged by the emerging concept that NK cells may constantly adapt or ""tune"" their responsiveness according to the amount of self MHC class I that they sense on surrounding cells. Hence, these therapeutic attempts would initially result in increased killing of tumor cells, but a parallel adaptation process might ultimately lead to impaired antitumor efficacy. We have investigated this question in two mouse models: inhibitory receptor blockade in vivo and adoptive transfer to MHC class I-disparate hosts. We show that changed self-perception via inhibitory receptors in mature NK cells reprograms the reactivity such that tolerance to healthy cells is always preserved. However, reactivity against cancer cells lacking critical MHC class I molecules (missing self-reactivity) still remains or may even be increased. This dissociation between activity against healthy cells and tumor cells may provide an answer as to why NK cells mediate graft-versus-leukemia effects without causing graft-versus-host disease and may also be utilized to improve immunotherapy.","['Wagner, Arnika Kathleen', 'Wickstrom, Stina Linnea', 'Tallerico, Rossana', 'Salam, Sadia', 'Lakshmikanth, Tadepally', 'Brauner, Hanna', 'Hoglund, Petter', 'Carbone, Ennio', 'Johansson, Maria Helena', 'Karre, Klas']","['Wagner AK', 'Wickstrom SL', 'Tallerico R', 'Salam S', 'Lakshmikanth T', 'Brauner H', 'Hoglund P', 'Carbone E', 'Johansson MH', 'Karre K']","['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of ""Magna Graecia,"" Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of ""Magna Graecia,"" Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. klas.karre@ki.se.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151120,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Klrg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology/*metabolism', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/22 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2015/11/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['2326-6066.CIR-15-0001 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2016 Feb;4(2):113-23. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0001.

For studies of occupational and household product exposure published from 1987 to 2014, the summary relative risk for childhood leukemia was 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53, 2.52; n = 20).

RESULTS: We present SomVarIUS, a computational method for detecting somatic variants using high throughput sequencing data from unpaired tissue samples. We evaluate the performance of the method using genomic data from synthetic and real tumor samples. SomVarIUS identifies somatic variants in exome-seq data of approximately 150 x coverage with at least 67.7% precision and 64.6% recall rates, when compared with paired-tissue somatic variant calls in real tumor samples. We demonstrate the utility of SomVarIUS by identifying somatic mutations in formalin-fixed samples, and tracking clonal dynamics of oncogenic mutations in targeted deep sequencing data from pre- and post-treatment leukemia samples.

The clinical course ranges from very indolent to rapidly progressive. Recently, several reports have indicated that mutation of the splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1) gene in CLL is predictive of a poor prognosis. Here, we investigated the SF3B1 mutational status of Japanese CLL patients and clarified the association between SF3B1 mutational status and prognostic factors. One hundred and two patients that were referred to our institutions between 1999 and 2013 were enrolled. Mutation analysis of SF3B1 (n = 87) and of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGHV) (n = 102) was performed at diagnosis. FISH analysis of del(11)(q22) was performed for 17 patients. Seven patients have SF3B1 mutation (8.0 %: K700E, 5/7; G742D, 1/7 and Y623C, 1/7). The median survival times for patients with mutated and non-mutated SF3B1 were 53 and 130 months, respectively. Overall survival of the mutated SF3B1 group was significantly lower than that of the non-mutated group (p = 0.0187). No relationship was observed between IGHV mutational status and SF3B1 mutation. There was no patient with SF3B1 mutation in the IGHV1-69 population (0/2). In conclusion, mutation of SF3B1 at diagnosis in Japanese CLL patients is predictive of a poor prognosis.","['Mitsui, Takeki', 'Koiso, Hiromi', 'Nakahashi, Hirotaka', 'Saitoh, Akio', 'Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Ishizaki, Takuma', 'Ogawa, Yoshiyuki', 'Takizawa, Makiko', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Jinbo, Takahiro', 'Ogura, Hidemi', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Sawamura, Morio', 'Sakura, Tohru', 'Karasawa, Masamitsu', 'Murakami, Hirokazu', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi']","['Mitsui T', 'Koiso H', 'Nakahashi H', 'Saitoh A', 'Shimizu H', 'Ishizaki T', 'Ogawa Y', 'Takizawa M', 'Yokohama A', 'Saitoh T', 'Jinbo T', 'Ogura H', 'Handa H', 'Sawamura M', 'Sakura T', 'Karasawa M', 'Murakami H', 'Nojima Y', 'Tsukamoto N']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan. mitsuit@gunma-u.ac.jp.', 'Oncology Center, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'Fujioka General Hospital, Fujioka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion Service, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Health Science, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Fujioka General Hospital, Fujioka, Japan.', 'Maebashi Red Cross Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization, Nishigunma National Hospital, Shibukawa, Japan.', 'Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Usui Hospital, Annaka, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Health Science, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Sciences, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.', 'Oncology Center, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151120,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics']",2015/11/22 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/22 06:00'],"['2015/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1912-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1912-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Feb;103(2):219-26. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1912-z.

In the present study, we utilized a myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to, 3 (MLLT3/MLL-AF9)-induced AML mouse model with or without exposure to irradiation. We found that the leukemia cells could survive and expand in hosts with intact immune systems, whereas leukemia progression was accelerated in mice with impaired immune systems. Moreover, the leukemia cells escaped from host immunosurveillance via editing their immunogenicity, including the up-regulation of an inhibitory antigen (i.e., CD47) and the down-regulation of active antigens (i.e., CD86, CD54, retinoic acid early transcript (RAE), histocompatibility 2, D region locus b (H2-Db) and H2-Dd). Natural killer (NK) cells were activated in the early phase of AML progression, whereas T cells were stimulated in the late phase. Furthermore, NK cell depletion showed that NK cells were necessary for the elimination of leukemia cells in our AML mouse model. Notably, CD155/CD226 primarily mediated the interaction between NK cells and leukemia cells and contributed to the antitumor effects of NK cells during the early phase of AML.

Included within this arena has been the genetic engineering of autologous T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against tumor target. The majority of this experience has included the use of CAR T cells directed against CD19 for B-cell hematologic malignancies. The most striking efficacy to date with CAR T cells directed against CD19 has been in relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with the overwhelming majority of patients experiencing complete remissions. In addition, single-center and largely early-phase studies have demonstrated responses in patients with varying histologic findings of relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The favorable response rates seen with this technology have been tempered by the high risk of toxicity, particularly in the form of cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Agents such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids have been used to treat these toxicities. The current state of the science includes strategies to circumvent and treat toxicity, manufacturing, and study of later-generation CAR constructs with the intention of improving efficacy and development of CARs against other tumor targets for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. The observation of an early efficacy ensures further integration and development of this modality into future immunotherapeutic strategies for various cancers.","['Davila, Marco L', 'Sauter, Craig', 'Brentjens, Renier']","['Davila ML', 'Sauter C', 'Brentjens R']","['From the *Moffitt Cancer Center and daggerMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PPO.0000000000000153 [doi]', '00130404-201511000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer J. 2015 Nov-Dec;21(6):470-4. doi: 10.1097/PPO.0000000000000153.,"['K12 CA090625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4656120,['NIHMS725452'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in chromatin regulators often result in more stem-like cells that seed a bulk leukemic population. Inhibitors targeting these proteins represent an emerging class of therapeutics, and identifying further chromatin regulators that promote disease progression may result in additional drug targets. We identified the chromatin-modifying protein CHD8 as necessary for cell survival in a mouse model of BCR-Abl+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This disease has a poor prognosis despite treatment with kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-Abl. Although implicated as a risk factor in autism spectrum disorder and a tumor suppressor in prostate and lung cancer, the mechanism of CHD8's activity is still unclear and has never been studied in the context of hematopoietic malignancies. Here we demonstrate that depletion of CHD8 in B-ALL cells leads to cell death. While multiple B cell malignancies were dependent on CHD8 expression for survival, T cell malignancies displayed milder phenotypes upon CHD8 knockdown. In addition, ectopic expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in a T cell malignancy partially alleviated the detrimental effect of CHD8 depletion. Our results demonstrate that CHD8 has a context-dependent role in cell survival, and its inhibition may be an effective treatment for B lymphoid malignancies.","['Shingleton, Jennifer R', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Shingleton JR', 'Hemann MT']","['Koch Institute for Integrated Cancer Research at MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Koch Institute for Integrated Cancer Research at MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151120,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (duplin protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0143275 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-30581 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 20;10(11):e0143275. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143275. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4654476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies, however, have explored the benefits of combining chemotherapy with stem-cell transplantation. Here, the authors present 2 cases of pediatric BPDCN treated with different modalities. The first case is a 13-year-old girl who presented with a 3-month history of an initially asymptomatic firm nodule on her left shin. The second case is a 15-year-old boy who presented with a 4-month history of an enlarging subcutaneous nodule on the lower leg. Immunohistochemical staining of both patients was positive for markers consistent with BPDCN. The latter patient received ALL-type therapy alone, whereas the former received ALL-type chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. Since initial treatment, both patients remain disease-free. These cases contribute to the limited number of pediatric BPDCN cases, thus helping to advance our knowledge toward an optimal treatment protocol for clinical remission.","['Nguyen, Catherine M', 'Stuart, Lauren', 'Skupsky, Hadas', 'Lee, Yun-Sun', 'Tsuchiya, Arline', 'Cassarino, David S']","['Nguyen CM', 'Stuart L', 'Skupsky H', 'Lee YS', 'Tsuchiya A', 'Cassarino DS']","['*Department of Dermatology, UC Irvine School of Medicine, Irvine, CA; daggerDepartment of Dermatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA; double daggerDepartment of Dermatology, UC Irvine Medical Center, Orange, CA; section signDepartment of Dermatology, Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles, CA; and paragraph signDepartment of Dermatology, Kaiser Permanente, Sunset Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/09/03 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/DAD.0000000000000348 [doi]', '00000372-201512000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2015 Dec;37(12):924-8. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000348.,,PMC4894807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They define disease subtypes and are used as prognostic markers, for minimal residual disease monitoring and therapeutic targets.

To address this, we engineered mouse strains that conditionally express E2A-HLF, a fusion oncogene from the translocation t(17;19) associated with 1% of pediatric B-cell precursor ALL. Conditional oncogene activation and expression were directed to the B-cell compartment by the Cre driver promoters CD19 or Mb1 (Igalpha, CD79a), or to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment by the Mx1 promoter. E2A-HLF expression in B-cell progenitors induced hyposplenia and lymphopenia, whereas expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells was embryonic lethal. Increased cell death was detected in E2A-HLF expressing cells, suggesting the need for cooperating genetic events that suppress cell death for B-cell oncogenic transformation.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the prognostic and predictive significance of changes in B2M during treatment have not been reported to date. METHODS: The authors analyzed 83 patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens (66 with recurrent/refractory disease) and 198 treatment-naive patients who were treated with combined fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) to characterize changes in B2M and their relationship with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: B2M rapidly decreased during treatment with ibrutinib; on multivariable analysis, patients who received FCR (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.18-0.90 [P = .027]) were less likely to have normalized B2M at 6 months than patients treated with ibrutinib. On univariable analysis, normalization of B2M was associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) from the 6-month landmark in patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens and FCR. On multivariable analysis, failure to achieve normalized B2M at 6 months of treatment was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 16.9; 95% CI, 1.3-220.0 [P = .031]) for patients treated with ibrutinib, after adjusting for the effects of baseline B2M, stage of disease, fludarabine-refractory disease, and del(17p). In contrast, in patients treated with FCR, negative minimal residual disease status in the bone marrow was the only variable found to be significantly associated with superior PFS (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.67 [P = .004]). CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of B2M at 6 months in patients treated with ibrutinib was found to be a useful predictor of subsequent PFS and may assist in clinical decision-making.","['Thompson, Philip A', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G']","['Thompson PA', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Xiao L', 'Wang X', 'Burger JA', 'Jain N', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematologic Oncology Services, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at Irvine, Orange, California.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151120,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29794 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2016 Feb 15;122(4):565-73. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29794.

To standardize BCR-ABL1 quantification, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the first international genetic reference panel. Here, we compared the BCR-ABL1 levels determined using international scale (IS)-based commercially available assays. METHODS: BCR-ABL1 transcripts were quantified using two IS-based assays. 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6 dilutions of the b3a2 positive RNA were used for evaluating linearity, precision, and limit of detection. Correlation of the assay was evaluated by using DNA obtained from CML patients carrying the BCR-ABL1 b3a2 and b2a2 types. RESULTS: Both Ipsogen and Asuragen assays showed fine linearity with reasonable %CV. LOD of each assay was calculated as 0.003% for Ipsogen, and 0.005% for Asuragen. By comparing the results that were lower than 10% by either one of the assay, Ipsogen and Asuragen results showed an overall good linear correlation with a tendency for the Ipsogen assay to show slightly higher levels than the Asuragen assay for b3a2 transcript. For b2a2, the tendency was opposite, with Asuragen showing higher values than the Ipsogen. CONCLUSIONS: Two commercially available IS-based BCR-ABL1 assays showed an overall good quantitative correlation. It should be taken into consideration that each assay tended to produce higher values than the other, depending on the BCR-ABL1 subtypes, suggesting that a separate conversion factor for each subtype can be more helpful when BCR-ABL1 transcript levels are converted into IS.","['Seo, Soo Hyun', 'Lee, Seung Jun', 'Park, Seungman', 'Kim, Min Jin', 'Song, Ji Yoon', 'Ra, Eun Kyung', 'Cho, Sung Im', 'Kim, Hyun Kyung', 'Yang, Man Gil', 'Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Park, Sung Sup', 'Seong, Moon-Woo']","['Seo SH', 'Lee SJ', 'Park S', 'Kim MJ', 'Song JY', 'Ra EK', 'Cho SI', 'Kim HK', 'Yang MG', 'Kim JY', 'Park SS', 'Seong MW']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biological Assay/methods/*standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Severity of Illness Index']",2015/11/21 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/cclm-2015-0611 [doi]', '/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2015-0611/cclm-2015-0611.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2016 Jul 1;54(7):1157-60. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2015-0611.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3377-4833'],,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between AML resistance to daunorubicin and susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cell lysis, and the putative expression of miRs. For this purpose, we used the parental AML cell lines U-937 and KG-1 and their equivalent resistant U937(R) and KG-1(R) cell lines. We demonstrate for the first time that the acquisition of resistance to DNR by the parental cell lines resulted in the acquisition of cross-resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. miR microarray analysis revealed that this cross-resistance was associated with miR-181a downregulation and the subsequent regulation of MAP3K10 and MAP2K1 tyrosine kinases and the BCL(-)2 (BCL(-)2 and MCL(-)1) family. Overexpression of miR-181a in AML blasts resulted in the attenuation of their resistance to DNR and to NK-cell-mediated killing. These data point to a determinant role of miR-181a in the sensitization of leukemic resistant cells to DNR and NK cells and suggest that miR-181a may provide a promising option for the treatment of immuno- and chemo-resistant blasts.","['Nanbakhsh, Arash', 'Visentin, Geraldine', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Janji, Bassam', 'Mussard, Eugenie', 'Dessen, Philippe', 'Meurice, Guillaume', 'Zhang, Yanyan', 'Louache, Fawzia', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Chouaib, Salem']","['Nanbakhsh A', 'Visentin G', 'Olive D', 'Janji B', 'Mussard E', 'Dessen P', 'Meurice G', 'Zhang Y', 'Louache F', 'Bourhis JH', 'Chouaib S']","['INSERM; Gustave Roussy Campus ; Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM; Gustave Roussy Campus ; Villejuif, France.', 'Centre de Cancerologie de Marseille; INSERM; Institut Paoli-Calmettes ; Marseille, France.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology.

This arises from many factors. For instance, interactions between molecules may or may not take place under varying conditions. Genetic or epigenetic mutations may also alter biological processes like transcription or translation. This uncertainty is often modeled by associating each interaction with a probability value. Studying biological networks under this probabilistic model has already been shown to yield accurate and insightful analysis of interaction data. However, the problem of assigning accurate probability values to interactions remains unresolved. In this paper, we present a novel method for computing interaction probabilities in signaling networks based on transcription levels of genes. The transcription levels define the signal reachability probability between membrane receptors and transcription factors. Our method computes the interaction probabilities that minimize the gap between the observed and the computed signal reachability probabilities. We evaluate our method on four signaling networks from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). For each network, we compute its edge probabilities using the gene expression profiles for seven major leukemia subtypes. We use these values to analyze how the stress induced by different leukemia subtypes affects signaling interactions.","['Gabr, Haitham', 'Rivera-Mulia, Juan Carlos', 'Gilbert, David M', 'Kahveci, Tamer']","['Gabr H', 'Rivera-Mulia JC', 'Gilbert DM', 'Kahveci T']","['Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151111,Germany,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol,EURASIP journal on bioinformatics & systems biology,101263720,,,,2015/11/21 06:00,2015/11/21 06:01,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13637-015-0031-8 [doi]', '31 [pii]']",epublish,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol. 2015 Nov 11;2015(1):10. doi: 10.1186/s13637-015-0031-8. eCollection 2015 Dec.,['R01 GM083337/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4642599,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biological networks', 'Interaction probability', 'Leukemia', 'Reachability', 'Signaling']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, following the concept of nanochemoprevention, which uses nanotechnology for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, we employed tea polyphenols, namely theaflavin (TF) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) encapsulated in a biodegradable nanoparticulate formulation based on poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) with approximately 26% and 18% encapsulation efficiency, respectively. It was observed that TF/EGCG encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) offered an up to ~7-fold dose advantage when compared with bulk TF/EGCG in terms of exerting its antiproliferative effects and also enhanced the anticancer potential of cisplatin (CDDP) in A549 (lung carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), and THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia) cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that TF/EGCG-NPs were more efficient than bulk TF/EGCG in sensitizing A549 cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis, with a dose advantage of up to 20-fold. Further, TF/EGCG-NPs, alone or in combination with CDDP, were more effective in inhibiting NF-kappaB activation and in suppressing the expression of cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor, involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis, respectively. EGCG and TF-NPs were also found to be more effective than bulk TF/EGCG in inducing the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis. Further, in vivo evaluation of these NPs in combination with CDDP showed an increase in life span (P<0.05) in mice bearing Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma cells, with apparent regression of tumor volume in comparison with mice treated with bulk doses with CDDP. These results indicate that EGCG and TF-NPs have superior cancer chemosensitization activity when compared with bulk TF/EGCG.","['Singh, Madhulika', 'Bhatnagar, Priyanka', 'Mishra, Sanjay', 'Kumar, Pradeep', 'Shukla, Yogeshwer', 'Gupta, Kailash Chand']","['Singh M', 'Bhatnagar P', 'Mishra S', 'Kumar P', 'Shukla Y', 'Gupta KC']","['CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, India.', 'CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi University Campus, Delhi, India.', 'CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, India.', 'CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi University Campus, Delhi, India.', 'CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, India.', 'CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, India ; CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi University Campus, Delhi, India.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20151030,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biflavonoids)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tea)', '1IA46M0D13 (theaflavin)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biflavonoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactic Acid/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/pathology', 'Polyglycolic Acid/*chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Polyphenols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tea/*chemistry']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S79489 [doi]', 'ijn-10-6789 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2015 Oct 30;10:6789-809. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S79489. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4636172,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer', 'cisplatin', 'nanoparticles', 'poly(lactide-co-glycolide)', 'tea polyphenols']",,,,,['Int J Nanomedicine. 2019 Sep 18;14:7625.

New leukemia patients had peripheral smear findings, thrombocytopenia, elevated PT, lactic acidosis and elevated LDH. Patients with a prior diagnosis of hematological malignancy had similar findings to new patients with increased thrombocytopenia in prior lymphoma cases.

An important issue in the treatment of CN-AML is how gene mutation patterns may help with patient management. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database has data from 200 cases of de novo AML including cytogenetics, gene mutations, and survival duration (prognosis). METHODS: Cases with the most common mutations and no cytogenetic abnormalities were selected from the TCGA. Unsupervised neural network analysis was performed to group them into clusters according to their pattern of mutations and survival. RESULTS: 72 cases of CN-AML with the 23 most common mutations were obtained from TCGA. Clustering was found to be based on 6 mutations, with the following prognostic groups: (a) good: NPM1, CEBPA, or TET2, (b) intermediate: NPM1/DNMT3A, or other mutations, (c) poor: RUNX1, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-ITD/NPM1, or FLT3-ITD/CEBPA. Some discrepancy between our results and those from previous studies is most likely due to inclusion of AML cases transformed from myeloproliferative neoplasms or myelodysplastic syndrome in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further molecular characterization and prognostic data most specific for the de novo subgroup of CN-AML patients.","['Welsh, Kerry J', 'Nedelcu, Elena', 'Wahed, Amer', 'Bai, Yu', 'Dasgupta, Amitava', 'Nguyen, Andy']","['Welsh KJ', 'Nedelcu E', 'Wahed A', 'Bai Y', 'Dasgupta A', 'Nguyen A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA Nghia.D.Nguyen@uth.tmc.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['45/5/515 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2015 Fall;45(5):515-21.,,,,"['(c) 2015 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'prognostic mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a subsequent study, ALL-02, we adopted a vincristine dexamethasone (VCR/DEX) pulse regimen as maintenance therapy in the context of the ALL-96 study using the same risk classification and treatment schedule. A total of 156 pediatric cases of ALL were treated with ALL-02. All of the patients were classified as standard-risk or high-risk.

Five months later, he relapsed with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Systemic chemotherapy and repeated intrathecal chemotherapy induced consciousness disturbances and frequent arrhythmia, prompting us to discontinue the chemotherapy. He had already received an 18-Gy prophylactic cranial irradiation, an 8-Gy total body irradiation, and a 15-Gy local irradiation for pituitary gland involvement. We therefore performed five intrathecal donor lymphocyte infusions (IDLIs) in escalating doses from 1 x 10(4) up to 1 x 10(6) cells/kg. All IDLIs were safe without infusion reactions or graft-versus-host disease. After the second and later IDLIs, donor mononuclear cells were continuously detected in cerebrospinal fluid; however, he did not achieve donor-dominant chimerism. Based on our case and four cases reported in the literature, the efficacy of IDLI therapy is limited for CNS relapse of hematological malignancies. However, we suggest that IDLI remains a feasible and safe option, as no GVHD or other adverse effects occurred, even in the HLA-haploidentical setting. We will make further efforts to increase the efficacy.","['Yanagisawa, Ryu', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Saito, Shoji', 'Tanaka, Miyuki', 'Shiohara, Masaaki', 'Shimodaira, Shigetaka', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Yanagisawa R', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Sakashita K', 'Saito S', 'Tanaka M', 'Shiohara M', 'Shimodaira S', 'Koike K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan. yxnakaza@shinshu-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Dentistry, Matsumoto Dental University, Shiojiri, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Center for Advanced Cell Therapy, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1, Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20151119,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Allografts', 'Bone Marrow', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Tissue Donors']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1902-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1902-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Jan;103(1):107-11. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1902-1.

Tet1/2 are abundantly expressed in HSC/HPCs and are implicated in hematological malignancies. Tet2 deletion in mice causes myeloid malignancies, while Tet1-null mice develop B cell lymphoma after an extended period of latency. Interestingly, TET1/2 are often concomitantly downregulated in acute B-lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we investigated the overlapping and non-redundant functions of Tet1/2 using Tet1/2 double-knockout (DKO) mice. DKO and Tet2(-/-) HSC/HPCs show overlapping and unique 5 hmC and 5 mC profiles. DKO mice exhibit strikingly decreased incidence and delayed onset of myeloid malignancies in comparison to Tet2(-/-) mice and in contrast develop lethal B cell malignancies. Transcriptome analysis of DKO tumors reveals expression changes in many genes dysregulated in human B cell malignancies, including LMO2, BCL6, and MYC. These results highlight the critical roles of TET1/2 individually and together in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies.","['Zhao, Zhigang', 'Chen, Li', 'Dawlaty, Meelad M', 'Pan, Feng', 'Weeks, Ophelia', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Cao, Zeng', 'Shi, Hui', 'Wang, Jiapeng', 'Lin, Li', 'Chen, Shi', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Qin, Zhaohui', 'Ni, Hongyu', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Jaenisch, Rudolf', 'Jin, Peng', 'Xu, Mingjiang']","['Zhao Z', 'Chen L', 'Dawlaty MM', 'Pan F', 'Weeks O', 'Zhou Y', 'Cao Z', 'Shi H', 'Wang J', 'Lin L', 'Chen S', 'Yuan W', 'Qin Z', 'Ni H', 'Nimer SD', 'Yang FC', 'Jaenisch R', 'Jin P', 'Xu M']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China; Department of Pediatrics, Herman B.

Clinicians now have access to 5 oral, generally well-tolerated, and highly effective TKIs. How should these agents be used for an individual patient to ensure the best possible duration and quality-of-life, to avoid treatment-related complications, and potentially to achieve a cure at an affordable cost? Because CML patients may need to continue TKI therapy indefinitely, the long-term safety of each treatment option must be considered. Evidence-based care requires an understanding of the optimal use of these drugs, their specific early and late toxicities, the prognostic significance of achieving treatment milestones, and the critical importance of molecular monitoring. Efficacy is important, but treatment choice does not depend only on efficacy. Choosing among various treatment options is informed by understanding the distinct benefits and risks of each agent, along with careful consideration of patient-specific factors, such as risk status, age, and comorbidities.","['Larson, Richard A']",['Larson RA'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago IL.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30722-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-06-641043 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Nov 19;126(21):2370-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-06-641043.,,,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, no progress has been made in this outcome over the past 10 years. PROCEDURE: We conducted the first nationwide prospective study of childhood advanced LBL to assess the efficacy and safety of ALL-directed therapy with an intensified maintenance phase. We omitted local radiotherapy including prophylactic cranial radiotherapy except for patients with initial central nervous system disease. The total duration of the treatment was 24 months. RESULTS: For the 136 patients analyzed in this study, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 82.9% and 5-year EFS was 77.9%. Thirty events were observed and 14 occurred before the initiation of intensified maintenance phase. Of 14 events, nine were observed as mediastinal enlargement. There was no significant difference in outcome when stratified according to gender or by immunophenotype. The 5-year EFS according to clinical stage in patients with T-cell LBL (T-LBL) was 70.6% for stage III and 88.9% for stage IV (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our first nationwide study provided about 80% cure rate with only one case of toxic death in childhood advanced LBL. However, our intensified maintenance therapy could not improve the survival outcome.

The molecular interaction of these complexes with lipid membranes and DNA has been investigated. The IR spectra and changes of (1)H, (13)C chemical shifts suggest that SO3 and COO groups of 2-sulfobenzoato ligand interact with O atom of glycerin fragment of DPPC. Moreover, the compounds form Sn-OP bonds with phosphate groups of DPPC, which was shown by the lower frequency shift of the nus(PO2(-)) and nuas(PO2(-)) band, by change of (31)P NMR signals and by DFT calculation. Another possibility is the interaction of the phosphate group of DPPC owing to formation of hydrogen bond O-H...O-P between water molecule coordinated to Sn and oxygen atom from the phosphate group. Using TCSPC-FCS we characterized DNA supramolecular assemblies' formation upon increasing TBTsbz, DTBTsbz and DBTsbz concentration. Diffusion time, lifetime and particle number changes are altered systematically with increasing Ccomp/CDNAbp ratio in following effectiveness order DBTsbz > TBTsbz > DTBTsbz. From those parameters we can conclude that all these compounds lead to a change of DNA winding, strand but not to DNA compaction. Investigated compounds show very high cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. All compounds exhibit efficient in vitro antitumor activity toward Jurkat (T-cell leukemia), CL-1 (T-lymphoblastoid cell line), GL-1 (B cell lymphoma cell line) and D-17 (canine osteosarcoma). The DBTsbz is more effective then carboplatin against canine osteosarcoma.","['Pruchnik, Hanna', 'Kral, Teresa', 'Poradowski, Dominik', 'Pawlak, Aleksandra', 'Drynda, Angelika', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz, Bozena', 'Hof, Martin']","['Pruchnik H', 'Kral T', 'Poradowski D', 'Pawlak A', 'Drynda A', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz B', 'Hof M']","['Department of Physics and Biophysics, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, ul.

Because glioma cells commonly exhibit genomic alterations involving genes that regulate cell-cycle control, there is a strong rationale for examining the potential efficacy of strategies to counteract this process. In this study, we examined the antiproliferative effects of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib in malignant human glioma cell lines, with intact, deleted, or mutated p53 or phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10; intact or deleted or p14ARF or wild-type or amplified epidermal growth factor receptor. Dinaciclib inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint, independent of p53 mutational status. In a standard 72-hour 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H, tetrazolium (MTS) assay, at clinically relevant concentrations, dose-dependent antiproliferative effects were observed, but cell death was not induced. Moreover, the combination of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and various growth-signaling inhibitors with dinaciclib did not yield synergistic cytotoxicity. In contrast, combination of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors ABT-263 (4-[4-[[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohexen-1-yl]methyl]piperazin-1-yl]-N-[ 4-[[(2R)-4-morpholin-4-yl-1-phenylsulfanylbutan-2-yl]amino]-3-(trifluoromethylsul fonyl)phenyl]sulfonylbenzamide) or ABT-737 (4-[4-[[2-(4-chlorophenyl)phenyl]methyl]piperazin-1-yl]-N-[4-[[(2R)-4-(dimethylam ino)-1-phenylsulfanylbutan-2-yl]amino]-3-nitrophenyl]sulfonylbenzamide) with dinaciclib potentiated the apoptotic response induced by each single drug. The synergistic killing by ABT-737 with dinaciclib led to cell death accompanied by the hallmarks of apoptosis, including an early loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential; the release of cytochrome c, smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor; phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane surface and activation of caspases and poly ADP-ribose polymerase. Mechanistic studies revealed that dinaciclib promoted proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. These observations may have important clinical implications for the design of experimental treatment protocols for malignant human glioma.","['Jane, Esther P', 'Premkumar, Daniel R', 'Cavaleri, Jonathon M', 'Sutera, Philip A', 'Rajasekar, Thatchana', 'Pollack, Ian F']","['Jane EP', 'Premkumar DR', 'Cavaleri JM', 'Sutera PA', 'Rajasekar T', 'Pollack IF']","[""Department of Neurologic Surgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (E.P.J., D.R.P., I.F.P.), University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine (E.P.J., D.R.P., J.M.C., P.A.S., T.R., I.F.P), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Tumor Center (D.R.P., I.F.P.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Neurologic Surgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (E.P.J., D.R.P., I.F.P.), University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine (E.P.J., D.R.P., J.M.C., P.A.S., T.R., I.F.P), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Tumor Center (D.R.P., I.F.P.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania daniel.premkumar@chp.edu ian.pollack@chp.edu."", ""Department of Neurologic Surgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (E.P.J., D.R.P., I.F.P.), University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine (E.P.J., D.R.P., J.M.C., P.A.S., T.R., I.F.P), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Tumor Center (D.R.P., I.F.P.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Neurologic Surgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (E.P.J., D.R.P., I.F.P.), University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine (E.P.J., D.R.P., J.M.C., P.A.S., T.R., I.F.P), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Tumor Center (D.R.P., I.F.P.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Neurologic Surgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (E.P.J., D.R.P., I.F.P.), University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine (E.P.J., D.R.P., J.M.C., P.A.S., T.R., I.F.P), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Tumor Center (D.R.P., I.F.P.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Neurologic Surgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (E.P.J., D.R.P., I.F.P.), University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine (E.P.J., D.R.P., J.M.C., P.A.S., T.R., I.F.P), and University of Pittsburgh Brain Tumor Center (D.R.P., I.F.P.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania daniel.premkumar@chp.edu ian.pollack@chp.edu.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151119,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indolizines', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Pyridinium Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/05/07 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.115.230052 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.115.230052 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2016 Feb;356(2):354-65. doi: 10.1124/jpet.115.230052.

It can be combined with other treatment strategies to enhance therapeutic effect. In acute leukemias, overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2 is observed in more than 70% of cases. Therefore, reduction of the Bcl-2 protein level could, in itself, prevent the development of cancer or could possibly help sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis inducers. The main objective of our work is to develop therapeutic liposome formulations characterized by high transfection efficiency, stability in the presence of serum, as well as specificity and toxicity for target (leukemic) cells. Each of our liposomal formulations consists of a core composed of antisense oligonucleotides complexed by either cationic lipid, DOTAP, or a synthetic polycation, polyethyleneimine, encapsulated within liposomes modified with polyethylenoglycol. In addition, the liposomal shells are enriched with covalently-bound antibodies recognizing a well characterized bio-marker, CD20, exposed on the surface of leukemia cells. The resulting immunoliposomes selectively and effectively reduced the expression of BCL2 in target cells. Model animal experiments carried out on mice-engrafted tumors expressing the specific marker showed high efficiency of the liposome formulations against specific tumor development. In conclusion, we show that lipid formulations based on a polyplex or lipoplex backbone additionally equipped with antibodies are promising non-viral vectors for specific oligonucleotide transfer into human tumor cells.","['Meissner, Justyna M', 'Toporkiewicz, Monika', 'Czogalla, Aleksander', 'Matusewicz, Lucyna', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Sikorski, Aleksander F']","['Meissner JM', 'Toporkiewicz M', 'Czogalla A', 'Matusewicz L', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Sikorski AF']","['Laboratory of Cytobiochemistry, Biotechnology Faculty, University of Wroclaw, Joliot-Curie 14a, 50-383 Wroclaw, Poland; Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, University of Environmental and Life Sciences Wroclaw, Kozuchowska 5b, 50-631 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytobiochemistry, Biotechnology Faculty, University of Wroclaw, Joliot-Curie 14a, 50-383 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytobiochemistry, Biotechnology Faculty, University of Wroclaw, Joliot-Curie 14a, 50-383 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytobiochemistry, Biotechnology Faculty, University of Wroclaw, Joliot-Curie 14a, 50-383 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Wroclaw Medical University, Department and Clinic of Haematology, Blood Neoplasms, and Bone Marrow Transplantation ul.

Notch signaling is a conserved cue that is an important determinant of cell fate in many contexts across animal development; for example, mammalian T cell differentiation in the thymus and neuroblast specification in Drosophila are both regulated by Notch signaling. However, Notch also functions as a mitogen, and constitutive Notch signaling potentiates T cell leukemia as well as Drosophila neuroblast tumors. While the role of Notch signaling has been studied in these and other cell types, it remains unclear how stem cells and progenitors change competence to respond to Notch over time. Notch is required in type II neuroblasts for normal development of their transit amplifying progeny, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). Here, we find that aging INPs lose competence to respond to constitutively active Notch signaling. Moreover, we show that reducing the levels of the old INP temporal transcription factor Eyeless/Pax6 allows Notch signaling to promote the de-differentiation of INP progeny into ectopic INPs, thereby creating a proliferative mass of ectopic progenitors in the brain. These findings provide a new system for studying progenitor competence and identify a novel role for the conserved transcription factor Eyeless/Pax6 in blocking Notch signaling during development.","['Farnsworth, Dylan R', 'Bayraktar, Omer Ali', 'Doe, Chris Q']","['Farnsworth DR', 'Bayraktar OA', 'Doe CQ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA; Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA; Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA.

HOTAIR acts as a scaffolding lncRNA. It interacts and guides various chromatin-modifying complexes such as PRC2 (polycomb-repressive complex 2) and LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) to the target gene promoters leading to their gene silencing. Various studies have demonstrated that HOTAIR overexpression is associated with breast cancer. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that HOTAIR is required for viability of breast cancer cells and is transcriptionally regulated by estradiol (E2) in vitro and in vivo. This chapter describes protocols for analysis of the HOTAIR promoter, cloning, transfection and dual luciferase assays, knockdown of protein synthesis by antisense oligonucleotides, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. These protocols are useful for studying the estrogen-mediated transcriptional regulation of lncRNA HOTAIR, as well as other protein coding genes and non-coding RNAs.","['Bhan, Arunoday', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Bhan A', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, 76019, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, 76019, USA. smandal@uta.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Estrogens)', '0 (HOTAIR long untranslated RNA, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Estrogens/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Workflow']",2015/11/21 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/11/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-3127-9_31 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1366:395-412. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3127-9_31.,['1R15 ES019129-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenetics', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogen receptor s', 'Gene expression', 'HOTAIR', 'Long non-coding RNA', 'Mixed lineage leukemia', 'Polycomb-repressive complex 2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To examine relative and absolute excess risk for hospitalizations up to 34 years after diagnosis of adolescent and young adult cancer compared with population comparisons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cohort study, conducted in Denmark, of 33,555 five-year survivors of adolescent or young adult cancer, diagnosed from 1943 through 2004, when they were 15 to 39 years of age, and 228,447 population comparisons, matched to the survivors by sex and year of birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cancer survivors and comparisons were followed up for hospitalizations in the Danish Patient Register through December 2010. Standardized hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 14 years, we identified 53,032 hospitalizations in cancer survivors, whereas 38,423 were expected, resulting in an overall RR of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.37-1.39). The data analysis was started in January 2015 and ended in June 2015. Additional data analyses requested by the reviewers were conducted in August 2015. The highest risks were found for the main diagnostic groups of diseases of blood and blood-forming organs (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.87-2.14), infectious and parasitic diseases (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.61-1.77), and malignant neoplasms (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.59-1.68). The overall AER was 2803 (95% CI, 2712-2893) per 100,000 person-years; the highest AERs were found for malignant neoplasms, diseases of digestive organs, and diseases of the circulatory system (18%, 15%, and 14% of total AER, respectively). Survivors of the 10 most common cancers in adolescents and young adults were at significantly increased risk for diseases in the 12 main diagnostic groups. The highest risks were those of survivors of leukemia (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 2.02-2.42), brain cancer (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.86-2.00), and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.80-1.94). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The large number of survivors and the use of hospital discharge diagnoses made it possible to draw a comprehensive picture of the complex inpatient disease burden experienced by survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer. The findings underscore a great diversity of cancer-related health problems that physicians and patients should be knowledgeable about.","['Rugbjerg, Kathrine', 'Olsen, Jorgen H']","['Rugbjerg K', 'Olsen JH']","['Danish Cancer Society Research Center, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/06/30 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['2470545 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.4393 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2016 Feb;2(2):193-200. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.4393.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2016 Feb;2(2):176-8.

Flow cytometric analysis of CD200 expression has utility in the evaluation of mature B-cell neoplasms, myeloma, and acute leukemia; however, CD200 expression in nonhematopoietic malignancies has not been extensively studied. METHODS: We studied 14 cases of biopsy proven pulmonary small cell carcinoma in which a discrete CD45 negative, CD56 positive abnormal cell population was identified by flow cytometry. We retrospectively evaluated these cases for flow cytometric and immunohistochemical evidence of CD200 expression. RESULTS: Twelve of the 14 cases of pulmonary small cell carcinoma showed convincing expression of CD200 by both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary small cell carcinoma frequently expresses CD200 at a level that can be detected by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. CD200 expression therefore may be used to help identify pulmonary small cell carcinoma in flow cytometry specimens and tissue sections. CD200 may also play a role in the biology of pulmonary small cell carcinoma and is a potential target of future therapies.

First, aminated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (AMWNTs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were alternately self-assembled on a gold electrode using a layer-by-layer strategy. Then, the hairpin DNA probe 1 (H1), with a thiol group at the 3' end and a ferrocenyl moiety (Fc) at the 5' end, was immobilized on the AMWNTs/AuNPs multilayer films through Au-S bonding. When the target DNA (TD) appeared, it hybridized with and opened the hairpin structure of H1, and Fc was forced away from the electrode surface, leading to a significant decrease in the current peak of square wave voltammetry. Subsequently, the hairpin DNA probe 2 (H2) bound to H1, freeing the TD to trigger another reaction cycle. The combination of this target-catalyzed hairpin assembly and the LBL assembly of nanomaterials achieved a detection limit of 0.1 pM with a wide linear range of 0.1-1000 pM. The sensor discriminated between mismatched DNA and the target DNA with high selectivity. This dual signal amplification strategy is relatively simple and inexpensive because it does not need any enzymes or sophisticated equipment and successfully assayed the FLT3 gene from real samples.","['Sun, Yingying', 'Ren, Qunxiang', 'Liu, Bo', 'Qin, Yan', 'Zhao, Shuang']","['Sun Y', 'Ren Q', 'Liu B', 'Qin Y', 'Zhao S']","['Department of Chemistry, Shenyang Medical College, Shenyang 110034, China.

This study reviews the utilization of multimodality imaging in patients with osteosarcoma at our institution and analyzes any potential radiation-related complications. Twenty-eight patients were identified. Three patients developed late complications-acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and early menopause. Using the patient's age and body part imaged, CT dose length product and effective dose was estimated with the use of a conversion factor for 19 patients. The effective doses were higher in the 3 patients with late complications than the other patients in the cohort (P=0.018). These results suggest an increased risk for adverse effects with higher CT exposures and effective doses. On the basis of our data and published data, methods to decrease the doses of radiation from medical imaging need to be explored. The number of CT scans may be limited.

A novel mechanism to circumvent this is to integrate drugs, such as anthracycline antibiotics, with nanoparticle delivery vehicles that can bypass intrinsic tumor drug-resistance mechanisms. DNA nanoparticles serve as an efficient binding platform for intercalating drugs (e.g., anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin, which are widely used to treat acute leukemias) and enable precise structure design and chemical modifications, for example, for incorporating targeting capabilities. Here, DNA nanostructures are utilized to circumvent daunorubicin drug resistance at clinically relevant doses in a leukemia cell line model. The fabrication of a rod-like DNA origami drug carrier is reported that can be controllably loaded with daunorubicin. It is further directly verified that nanostructure-mediated daunorubicin delivery leads to increased drug entry and retention in cells relative to free daunorubicin at equal concentrations, which yields significantly enhanced drug efficacy. Our results indicate that DNA origami nanostructures can circumvent efflux-pump-mediated drug resistance in leukemia cells at clinically relevant drug concentrations and provide a robust DNA nanostructure design that could be implemented in a wide range of cellular applications due to its remarkably fast self-assembly ( approximately 5 min) and excellent stability in cell culture conditions.","['Halley, Patrick D', 'Lucas, Christopher R', 'McWilliams, Emily M', 'Webber, Matthew J', 'Patton, Randy A', 'Kural, Comert', 'Lucas, David M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Castro, Carlos E']","['Halley PD', 'Lucas CR', 'McWilliams EM', 'Webber MJ', 'Patton RA', 'Kural C', 'Lucas DM', 'Byrd JC', 'Castro CE']","['Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, College of Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Biophysics Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Biophysics Graduate Program, Department of Physics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering, Biophysics Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151119,Germany,Small,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",101235338,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (daunorubicin-DNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Adducts/*chemistry/*pharmacology/ultrastructure', 'Daunorubicin/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/10/19 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/smll.201502118 [doi]'],ppublish,Small. 2016 Jan 20;12(3):308-20. doi: 10.1002/smll.201502118.

However, little is known about the therapeutic benefits such CML-LIC targeting therapies might bring to CML patients. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of EW-7197, an orally bioavailable transforming growth factor-beta signaling inhibitor which has recently been approved as an Investigational New Drug (NIH, USA), to suppress CML-LICs in vivo. Compared to TKI treatment alone, administration of TKI plus EW-7197 to CML-affected mice significantly delayed disease relapse and prolonged survival. Notably, combined treatment with EW-7197 plus TKI was effective in eliminating CML-LICs even if they expressed the TKI-resistant T315I mutant BCR-ABL1 oncogene. Collectively, these results indicate that EW-7197 may be a promising candidate for a new therapeutic that can greatly benefit CML patients by working in combination with TKIs to eradicate CML-LICs.","['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Ishihara, Kaori', 'Jomen, Yoshie', 'Jin, Cheng Hua', 'Kim, Dong-Hyun', 'Gu, Yoon-Kang', 'Jeong, Eun-Sook', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Krause, Daniela S', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Bae, Eunjin', 'Takihara, Yoshihiro', 'Hirao, Atsushi', 'Oshima, Hiroko', 'Oshima, Masanobu', 'Ooshima, Akira', 'Sheen, Yhun Yhong', 'Kim, Seong-Jin', 'Kim, Dae-Kee']","['Naka K', 'Ishihara K', 'Jomen Y', 'Jin CH', 'Kim DH', 'Gu YK', 'Jeong ES', 'Li S', 'Krause DS', 'Kim DW', 'Bae E', 'Takihara Y', 'Hirao A', 'Oshima H', 'Oshima M', 'Ooshima A', 'Sheen YY', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim DK']","['Exploratory Project on Cancer Stem Cells, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Exploratory Project on Cancer Stem Cells, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Exploratory Project on Cancer Stem Cells, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and PharmacoGenomics Research Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and PharmacoGenomics Research Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and PharmacoGenomics Research Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg Speyer Haus, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', ""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Cancer Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Exploratory Project on Cancer Stem Cells, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'CHA Cancer Institute and Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'CHA Cancer Institute and Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'CHA Cancer Institute and Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160126,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Triazoles)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '6T4O391P5Y (vactosertib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (TGFBR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Tgfbr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/07/19 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12849 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Feb;107(2):140-8. doi: 10.1111/cas.12849.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study among 10 698 children with new-onset acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from 41 US children's hospitals between January 1999 and September 2011. Influenza-related hospitalizations were identified using ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes, excluding hospitalizations during low-prevalence influenza periods. Follow-up was censored at the earliest of 5 events: end of study period, expected end of chemotherapy, last known hospitalization, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or death. Data were collected on hospitalization characteristics and resource utilization. Hospitalization rates were calculated using season-adjusted person-time. Crude attributable in-hospital mortality was calculated using baseline mortality for noninfluenza hospitalizations during the same period. Subgroup analysis was performed by time from ALL diagnosis and by age category. RESULTS: The rate of influenza-related hospitalizations was 618.3 per 100 000 person-months. Rates were similar by time from ALL diagnosis and across age categories. Overall attributable in-hospital mortality was 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3%-2.3%) and was highest for children <6 months from diagnosis (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.4%-4.5%) and children <2 years of age (6.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-22.7%). Total length of stay, days of broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, and duration of intensive care were significantly greater for influenza-related hospitalizations compared with noninfluenza hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of influenza-related hospitalizations in children with ALL is high and associated with significantly increased resource utilization and attributable mortality.","['Lee, Grace E', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Xiao, Rui', 'Coffin, Susan E', 'Feemster, Kristen', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Li, Yimei', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Lee GE', 'Fisher BT', 'Xiao R', 'Coffin SE', 'Feemster K', 'Seif AE', 'Bagatell R', 'Li Y', 'Huang YS', 'Aplenc R']","['Division of Infectious Diseases Department of Pediatrics.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Department of Pediatrics Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Department of Pediatrics Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Department of Pediatrics."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Department of Pediatrics."", 'Oncology Department of Pediatrics.', 'Oncology Department of Pediatrics.', 'Oncology Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Oncology Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Department of Pediatrics Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140722,England,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,101586049,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', '*Hospitalization', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Influenza, Human/*epidemiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/20 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['piu066 [pii]', '10.1093/jpids/piu066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc. 2015 Dec;4(4):290-6. doi: 10.1093/jpids/piu066.

To date, there are many applications of mTOR inhibitors in oncology with an expanding development rapidly. However, resistances appear to mTOR inhibitors which lead to 2nd generation mTOR inhibitors development.

Advances in diagnostic methods, including polymerase chain reaction, have led to increased identification and awareness of these infections. Lack of consensus on clinically significant endpoints and the small number of patients affected in each cancer institution every year make it difficult to assess the efficacy of new or available antiviral drugs. In this systematic review, we summarized data from all published studies on parainfluenza virus infections in HM patients and HCT recipients, focusing on incidence, risk factors, long-term outcomes, mortality, prevention, and management with available or new investigational agents. Vaccines against these viruses are lacking; thus, infection control measures remain the mainstay for preventing nosocomial spread. A multi-institutional collaborative effort is recommended to standardize and validate clinical endpoints for PIV infections, which will be essential for determining efficacy of future vaccine and antiviral therapies.","['Shah, Dimpy P', 'Shah, Pankil K', 'Azzi, Jacques M', 'Chemaly, Roy F']","['Shah DP', 'Shah PK', 'Azzi JM', 'Chemaly RF']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

The integrity of the lipid rafts containing these receptors is maintained by the glycolipid glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (GPI-A). It has been reported that a cleavage fragment of the fifth component of the activated complement cascade, C5a, has an important role in mobilizing HSPCs into the peripheral blood (PB) by (i) inducing degranulation of BM-residing granulocytes and (ii) promoting their egress from the BM into the PB so that they permeabilize the endothelial barrier for subsequent egress of HSPCs. We report here that hematopoietic cell-specific phospholipase C-beta2 (PLC-beta2) has a crucial role in pharmacological mobilization of HSPCs. On the one hand, when released during degranulation of granulocytes, it digests GPI-A, thereby disrupting membrane lipid rafts and impairing retention of HSPCs in BM niches. On the other hand, it is an intracellular enzyme required for degranulation of granulocytes and their egress from BM. In support of this dual role, we demonstrate that PLC-beta2-knockout mice are poor mobilizers and provide, for the first time, evidence for the involvement of this lipolytic enzyme in the mobilization of HSPCs.","['Adamiak, M', 'Poniewierska-Baran, A', 'Borkowska, S', 'Schneider, G', 'Abdelbaset-Ismail, A', 'Suszynska, M', 'Abdel-Latif, A', 'Kucia, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Adamiak M', 'Poniewierska-Baran A', 'Borkowska S', 'Schneider G', 'Abdelbaset-Ismail A', 'Suszynska M', 'Abdel-Latif A', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Gill Heart Institute, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Gill Heart Institute, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement C5a/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Membrane Microdomains', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phospholipase C beta/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015315 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.315 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Apr;30(4):919-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.315.

D2HG has been shown to promote leukemogenesis even in the absence of mutated IDH, but the prognostic significance of pretreatment serum D2HG levels in patients with IDH-mutated AML is unclear. We measured D2HG serum levels in 84 patients with IDH-mutated AML treated in the prospective, randomized multicenter AML2003 trial of the German Study Alliance Leukemia. Multivariate Cox regression showed D2HG levels to negatively impact on event-free survival (EFS) as a continuous variable in the entire IDH(mut) cohort (P=0.04), with no effect on overall survival (OS). In a subgroup analysis, the negative impact of D2HG on EFS was found to be restricted to patients with mutations in IDH1 (P=0.003), adjusted for age, leukocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase and European LeukemiaNet risk score. We thus conclude that pretreatment D2HG serum levels may yield prognostic information in patients with IDH1-mutated, but not in IDH2-mutated AML, possibly due to different subcellular localizations of IDH1 and IDH2.","['Balss, J', 'Thiede, C', 'Bochtler, T', 'Okun, J G', 'Saadati, M', 'Benner, A', 'Pusch, S', 'Ehninger, G', 'Schaich, M', 'Ho, A D', 'von Deimling, A', 'Kramer, A', 'Heilig, C E']","['Balss J', 'Thiede C', 'Bochtler T', 'Okun JG', 'Saadati M', 'Benner A', 'Pusch S', 'Ehninger G', 'Schaich M', 'Ho AD', 'von Deimling A', 'Kramer A', 'Heilig CE']","['Department of Neuropathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and DKTK, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and DKTK, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and DKTK, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Due to the increasing use of comprehensive tumor genomic profiling, many non-V600 BRAF mutations are being detected whose functional consequences and therapeutic actionability are often unknown. We investigated an atypical BRAF mutation, F595L, which was identified along with mutant HRAS in histiocytic sarcoma and also occurs in epithelial cancers, melanoma and neuroblastoma, and determined its interaction with mutant RAS. Unlike other DFG motif mutants, BRAF(F595L) is a gain-of-function variant with intermediate activity that does not act paradoxically, but nevertheless cooperates with mutant RAS to promote oncogenic signaling, which is efficiently blocked by pan-RAF and MEK inhibitors. Mutation data from patients and cell lines show that BRAF(F595L), as well as other intermediate-activity BRAF mutations, frequently coincide with mutant RAS in various cancers. These data define a distinct class of activating BRAF mutations, extend the spectrum of patients with systemic histiocytoses and other malignancies who are candidates for therapeutic blockade of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and underscore the value of comprehensive genomic testing for uncovering the vulnerabilities of individual tumors.","['Kordes, M', 'Roring, M', 'Heining, C', 'Braun, S', 'Hutter,

The importance of BTK in cell trafficking is emphasized by the clonal contraction proceeded by lymphocytosis typical for the enzyme inhibitor, ibrutinib, in B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we investigated BTK regulation of leukemic B-cell trafficking in a mouse model of aggressive TCL1 CLL-like disease. Inhibiting BTK by ibrutinib reduced surface membrane (sm) levels of CXCR4 but not CXCR5, CD49d and other adhesion/homing receptors. Decreased smCXCR4 levels resulted from blocking receptor signal transduction, which in turn aborted cycling from and to the membrane. This resulted in rapid re-distribution of CLL cells from spleens and lymph nodes into the circulation. CLL cells with impaired smCXCR4 from BTK inhibition failed to home to spleens. These functional changes mainly resulted from inhibition of CXCR4 phosphorylation at Ser339, mediated directly by blocking BTK enzymatic activity and indirectly by affecting the function of downstream targets PLCgamma2 and PKCmu, and eventually synthesis of PIM-1 and BTK itself. Our data identify CXCR4 as a key regulator in BTK-mediated CLL-cell retention and have elucidated a complex set of not previously described mechanisms responsible for these effects.","['Chen, S-S', 'Chang, B Y', 'Chang, S', 'Tong, T', 'Ham, S', 'Sherry, B', 'Burger, J A', 'Rai, K R', 'Chiorazzi, N']","['Chen SS', 'Chang BY', 'Chang S', 'Tong T', 'Ham S', 'Sherry B', 'Burger JA', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Karches Center for CLL Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.', 'Karches Center for CLL Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Karches Center for CLL Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Center for Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Karches Center for CLL Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'Karches Center for CLL Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015316 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.316 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Apr;30(4):833-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.316.

As a consequence, a fusion gene (bcr-abl) encoding a constitutively active kinase is generated. The first-line treatment consists on BCR-ABL inhibitors such as Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib. Nevertheless, such treatment may lead to the selection of resistant cells. Therefore, finding molecules that enhance the anti-proliferative effect of first-line drugs is of value. Hyaluronan oligomers (oHA) are known to be able to sensitize several tumor cells to chemotherapy. We have previously demonstrated that oHA can revert Vincristine resistance in mouse lymphoma and human leukemia cell lines. However, little is known about the role of oHA in hematological malignancies. The aim of this work was to determine whether oHA are able to modulate the anti-proliferative effect of Imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines. The effect on apoptosis and senescence as well as the involvement of signaling pathways were also evaluated. For this purpose, the human CML cell lines K562 and Kv562 (resistant) were used. We demonstrated that oHA sensitized both cell lines to the anti-proliferative effect of Imatinib increasing apoptosis and senescence. Moreover, this effect would be accomplished through the down-regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway.

In the last decades, these transmissible tumors have been proved to be transmitted through living cells by cytological, histological and genetic studies. CTVT, the oldest mammalian somatic cell line, and DFTD originated from Schwann cell have been reported to avoid immunological recognition by down-regulating MHC expression, while a high copy number of Steamer retrotransposon is commonly exist in SSCL. In recent years, the whole-genome sequencing of CTVT and DFTD have been completed which facilitates studies on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, transmission and evolution of transmissible tumors at the whole-genome level.

Despite structural similarity, however, DnR and DoX treatments have been directed toward leukemias and solid tumor types, respectively. Due to a paucity of in vitro data regarding differential use of DnR or DoX, we assessed the cytotoxicity of these compounds against solid and hematological tumor cell types. In addition, we examined liposomal formulations of DnR (L-DnR) and DoX (PEG-DoX), which, in contrast to DnR or DoX, demonstrate antineoplastic activity with reduced cardiotoxicity in vivo. Accordingly, cytotoxicity testing (with [methyl/-(3)H]thymidine incorporation) of DnR, DoX, L-DnR, and PEG-DoX on a range of different human tumor cell lines (e.g., breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia tumor cell types) was performed. Our data indicate comparable activity for DnR, DoX, or L-DnR in all tumor cell types examined [e.g., SK-BR-3 (breast adenocarcinoma) cells: IC50 values = 5.9, 9.1, and 4.7 ng/mL for DnR, DoX, and L-DnR respectively]. In addition, several solid tumor cell types were more responsive to DnR than DoX [e.g., DU-145 (prostate carcinoma) cells: IC50 values = 10.4 and 41.2 ng/mL for DnR and DoX, respectively; p >. 001]. Interestingly, PEG-DoX was substantively less effective for all tumor cells (IC50 values were about 100-10,000 times greater for PEG-DoX than for DnR, DoX, or L-DnR; p >. 001, all cases). Reduced PEG-DoX activity in vitro may be related to polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties present on the liposomal exterior of PEG-DoX, which are not present on L-DnR. Nonetheless, taken together, these data suggest that DnR and DoX demonstrate comparable efficacy in vitro and that specific liposomal encapsulation (L-DnR) does not mitigate DnR efficacy in vitro.","['Wiles, M E', 'Bell, C', 'Landfair, D', 'Lynam, E', 'Bendele, R A']","['Wiles ME', 'Bell C', 'Landfair D', 'Lynam E', 'Bendele RA']","['a Cell Biology/Life Sciences, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA.', 'a Cell Biology/Life Sciences, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA.', 'a Cell Biology/Life Sciences, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA.', 'a Cell Biology/Life Sciences, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA.', 'a Cell Biology/Life Sciences, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10717549709052011 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Deliv. 1997;4(4):255-62. doi: 10.3109/10717549709052011.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxicity', 'Daunorubicin', 'Doxorubicin', 'Liposome', 'Tumor Cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with EVI-1-positive AML have poor initial responses to chemotherapy and high relapse rates, indicating an urgent need for alternative treatment strategies improving clinical outcome for these patients. Because treatment of acute promyelocytic patients with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has improved the survival of these patients substantially, we investigated whether ATRA might also be effective for the subgroup of AML patients with EVI-1 overexpression. Here, we show that a substantial part of the EVI-1-positive AML cases respond to ATRA by induction of differentiation and decreased clonogenic capacity of myeloid blasts. Most importantly, we demonstrate that in vivo treatment of primary EVI-1-positive AML with ATRA leads to a significant reduction in leukemic engraftment. Altogether, our results show that a considerable part of the EVI-1-positive primary AML cases are sensitive to ATRA, suggesting that combining ATRA with the currently used conventional chemotherapy might be a promising treatment strategy decreasing relapse rates and enhancing complete remissions in this poor prognostic subgroup of AML patients.","['Verhagen, Han J M P', 'Smit, Marjon A', 'Rutten, Arjo', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'Poddighe, Pino J', 'Merle, Pauline A', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Smit, Linda']","['Verhagen HJ', 'Smit MA', 'Rutten A', 'Denkers F', 'Poddighe PJ', 'Merle PA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Smit L']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/06/15 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30519-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-07-653840 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 28;127(4):458-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-07-653840.

However, the functional role of p21 induction in G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and the mechanisms of p21 induction by ursolic acid have not been critically addressed. In the current study, we demonstrated that p21 played a mediator role in G1 cell cycle arrest by ursolic acid, whereas p21-mediated up-regulation of Mcl-1 compromised apoptotic effect of ursolic acid. These results suggest that p21 induction plays a dual role in the anti-cancer activity of ursolic acid in terms of cell cycle and apoptosis regulation. p21 induction by ursolic acid was attributed to p53 transcriptional activation. Moreover, we found that ursolic acid was able to inhibit murine double minute-2 protein (MDM2) and T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), the two negative regulator of p53, which in turn contributed to ursolic acid-induced p53 activation. Our findings provided novel insights into understanding of the mechanisms involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in response to ursolic acid exposure.","['Zhang, Xudong', 'Song, Xinhua', 'Yin, Shutao', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Fan, Lihong', 'Hu, Hongbo']","['Zhang X', 'Song X', 'Yin S', 'Zhao C', 'Fan L', 'Hu H']","['Department of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, Beijing Key Laboratory of Functional Food from Plant Resources, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China Development Center of Science and Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing 100193, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, Beijing Key Laboratory of Functional Food from Plant Resources, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, Beijing Key Laboratory of Functional Food from Plant Resources, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, Beijing Key Laboratory of Functional Food from Plant Resources, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, Beijing Key Laboratory of Functional Food from Plant Resources, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China hongbo@cau.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151117,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1535370215616195 [pii]', '10.1177/1535370215616195 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2016 Mar;241(5):501-8. doi: 10.1177/1535370215616195.

However, little is known about the mechanism responsible for regulating this differentiation process. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA-Seq analysis to investigate the genes differently expressed in THP1 cells treated with and without PMA and examined those that may be responsible for the PMA-induced differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. We found 3,000 genes to be differentially expressed after PMA treatment. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes related to cellular processes and regulation of biological processes were significantly enriched. KEGG analysis also demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and phagosome pathway. Importantly, we reveal an important role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in PMA-induced THP1 cell differentiation.

CML is now usually treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The mechanism and natural history of CML is still unclear. Here, we summarize the present CML animal disease models and compare them with each other.

Retroviral endogenization is an adaptation process for the host genome, and ERVs are gradually attenuated or inactivated by mutation. However, some ERVs that have been ""domesticated"" by their hosts eventually gain physiological functions, such as placentation or viral resistance. We previously reported the discovery of Refrex-1, a soluble antiretroviral factor in domestic cats that specifically inhibits infection by feline leukemia virus subgroup D (FeLV-D), a chimeric virus of FeLV, and a feline ERV, ERV-DC. Refrex-1 is a truncated envelope protein (Env) encoded by both ERV-DC7 and ERV-DC16 proviral loci. Here, we reconstituted ancestral and functional Env from ERV-DC7 and ERV-DC16 envelope genes (env) by inducing reverse mutations. Unexpectedly, ERV-DC7 and ERV-DC16 full-length Env (ERV-DC7 fl and ERV-DC16 fl), reconstructed by removing stop codons, did not produce infectious viral particles. ERV-DC7 fl and ERV-DC16 fl were highly expressed in cells but were not cleaved into surface subunits (SU) and transmembrane subunits, nor were they incorporated into virions. G407R/N427I-A429T and Y431D substitutions within the SU C-terminal domain of ERV-DC7 fl and ERV-DC16 fl, respectively, caused these dysfunctions. The residues glycine 407 and tyrosine 431 are relatively conserved among infectious gammaretroviruses, and their substitution causes the same dysfunctions as the tested retroviruses. Our results reveal that specific mutations within the SU C-terminal domain suppressed Env cleavage and incorporation into virions and indicate that these mutations contributed to the domestication of Refrex-1 through multistep events that occurred in the postintegration period. IMPORTANCE: Domestic cats are colonized with various exogenous retroviruses (exRVs), such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and their genomes contain numerous ERVs, some of which are replication-competent proviruses. The feline hosts, exRVs, and ERVs have complicated genetic interactions and provide an interesting field model for triangular relationships: recombination between FeLV and ERV-DC, which is a feline ERV, generated FeLV-D, a chimeric virus, and FeLV-D is restricted by Refrex-1, an antiretroviral factor corresponding to truncated Env of ERV-DC7 and ERV-DC16. Here, we reconstructed ancestral, functional Env from ERV-DC7 and ERV-DC16 env by inducing reverse mutations to elucidate how Refrex-1 was generated from its ancestor. Our results reveal that they were repeatedly inactivated by mutations preventing Env maturation. Our results provide insights into how ERVs were ""domesticated"" by their hosts and identify the mutations that mediated these evolutions. Notably, experiments that restore inactivated ERVs might uncover previously unrecognized features or properties of retroviruses.","['Ito, Jumpei', 'Baba, Takuya', 'Kawasaki, Junna', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Ito J', 'Baba T', 'Kawasaki J', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan kaz@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01904-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01904-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2015 Nov 18;90(3):1470-85. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01904-15.

In the present study, we investigated the Rex dependence of the complete set of alternatively spliced HTLV-1 mRNAs. Analyses of cells transfected with Rex-wild-type and Rex-knockout HTLV-1 molecular clones using splice site-specific quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR revealed that mRNAs encoding the p30Tof, p13, and p12/8 proteins were Rex dependent, while the p21rex mRNA was Rex independent. These findings provide a rational explanation for the intermediate-late temporal pattern of expression of the p30tof, p13, and p12/8 mRNAs described in previous studies. All the Rex-dependent mRNAs contained a 75-nucleotide intronic region that increased the nuclear retention and degradation of a reporter mRNA in the absence of other viral sequences. Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis revealed that this sequence formed a stable hairpin structure. Cell cycle synchronization experiments indicated that mitosis partially bypasses the requirement for Rex to export Rex-dependent HTLV-1 transcripts. These findings indicate a link between the cycling properties of the host cell and the temporal pattern of viral expression/latency that might influence the ability of the virus to spread and evade the immune system. IMPORTANCE: HTLV-1 is a complex retrovirus that causes two distinct pathologies termed adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy in about 5% of infected individuals. Expression of the virus depends on the concerted action of Tax, which drives transcription of the viral genome, and Rex, which favors expression of incompletely spliced mRNAs and determines a 2-phase temporal pattern of virus expression. The findings reported in this study revealed a novel cis-acting regulatory element and indicated that mitosis partially bypasses the requirement for Rex to export Rex-dependent HTLV-1 transcripts. Our results add a layer of complexity to the mechanisms controlling the expression of alternatively spliced HTLV-1 mRNAs and suggest a link between the cycling properties of the host cell and the temporal pattern of viral expression/latency that might influence the ability of the virus to spread and evade the immune system.","['Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Rende, Francesca', 'Bona, Marion K', 'Sztuba-Solinska, Joanna', 'Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Tognon, Martina', 'LeGrice, Stuart F J', 'Franchini, Genoveffa', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Cavallari I', 'Rende F', 'Bona MK', 'Sztuba-Solinska J', 'Silic-Benussi M', 'Tognon M', 'LeGrice SF', 'Franchini G', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padua, Italy v.ciminale@unipd.it.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid)', '0 (rex Protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Gene Products, rex/deficiency/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Mitosis', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid']",2015/11/20 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/11/20 06:00'],"['2015/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02298-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02298-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2015 Nov 18;90(3):1486-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02298-15.

In this group, Aspergillus infections account for the majority of deaths due to mold pathogens. Although early detection is associated with improved outcomes, current diagnostic regimens lack sensitivity and specificity. Patients undergoing chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and lung transplantation were enrolled in a multi-site prospective observational trial. Proven and probable IPA cases and matched controls were subjected to discovery proteomics analyses using a biofluid analysis platform, fractionating plasma into reproducible protein and peptide pools. From 556 spots identified by 2D gel electrophoresis, 66 differentially expressed post-translationally modified plasma proteins were identified in the leukemic subgroup only. This protein group was rich in complement components, acute-phase reactants and coagulation factors. Low molecular weight peptides corresponding to abundant plasma proteins were identified. A candidate marker panel of host response (9 plasma proteins, 4 peptides), fungal polysaccharides (galactomannan), and cell wall components (beta-D glucan) were selected by statistical filtering for patients with leukemia as a primary underlying diagnosis. Quantitative measurements were developed to qualify the differential expression of the candidate host response proteins using selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assays, and then applied to a separate cohort of 57 patients with leukemia. In this verification cohort, a machine learning ensemble-based algorithm, generalized pathseeker (GPS) produced a greater case classification accuracy than galactomannan (GM) or host proteins alone. In conclusion, Integration of host response proteins with GM improves the diagnostic detection of probable IPA in patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancy. Upon further validation, early detection of probable IPA in leukemia treatment will provide opportunities for earlier interventions and interventional clinical trials.","['Brasier, Allan R', 'Zhao, Yingxin', 'Spratt, Heidi M', 'Wiktorowicz, John E', 'Ju, Hyunsu', 'Wheat, L Joseph', 'Baden, Lindsey', 'Stafford, Susan', 'Wu, Zheng', 'Issa, Nicolas', 'Caliendo, Angela M', 'Denning, David W', 'Soman, Kizhake', 'Clancy, Cornelius J', 'Nguyen, M Hong', 'Sugrue, Michele W', 'Alexander, Barbara D', 'Wingard, John R']","['Brasier AR', 'Zhao Y', 'Spratt HM', 'Wiktorowicz JE', 'Ju H', 'Wheat LJ', 'Baden L', 'Stafford S', 'Wu Z', 'Issa N', 'Caliendo AM', 'Denning DW', 'Soman K', 'Clancy CJ', 'Nguyen MH', 'Sugrue MW', 'Alexander BD', 'Wingard JR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Institute for Translational Sciences, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Institute for Translational Sciences, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Institute for Translational Sciences, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Institute for Translational Sciences, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Institute for Translational Sciences, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'MiraVista Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, United States of America.', 'Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Biomolecular Resource Facility, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Biomolecular Resource Facility, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Harvard University, Boston, MA, United States of America.', 'Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UTMB, Galveston, TX, United States of America.', 'University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States of America.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville, FLA, United States of America.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville, FLA, United States of America.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville, FLA, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Fungal/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0143165 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-26785 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 18;10(11):e0143165. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143165. eCollection 2015.,"['HHSN272200800048C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000071/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000071/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN266200700023C/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4651335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently described that beta-catenin increases total Runx1 mRNA levels in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors and enhances spatial proximity with its translocation partner ETO. Here, we report that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in HL60 and Jurkat leukemia-derived cell lines and CD34(+) progenitors selectively activate the production of the longer distal P1-Runx1 mRNA isoform. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that the differential increase in P1-Runx1 expression is accomplished through a minimal beta-catenin responsive region that includes a highly conserved TCF/LEF-binding element, located -20/-16 bp upstream of the canonical distal P1-Runx1 transcription start site. We conclude that the distal P1-Runx1 promoter is a direct transcriptional target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that may be important in normal hematopoiesis or its transition into malignant stem cells during the onset or progression of leukemia.","['Medina, Matias A', 'Ugarte, Giorgia D', 'Vargas, Macarena F', 'Avila, Miguel E', 'Necunir, David', 'Elorza, Alvaro A', 'Gutierrez, Soraya E', 'De Ferrari, Giancarlo V']","['Medina MA', 'Ugarte GD', 'Vargas MF', 'Avila ME', 'Necunir D', 'Elorza AA', 'Gutierrez SE', 'De Ferrari GV']","['Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.', 'Millennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy, Santiago, Chile.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Center for Biomedical Research, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160211,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.25258 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2016 Jul;231(7):1460-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.25258.

Mouse SAMHD1 (mSAMHD1) restricts HIV-1 infection in non-dividing cells, but whether its phosphorylation regulates retroviral restriction is unknown. Here we identified six phospho-sites of mSAMHD1, including T634 that is homologous to T592 of hSAMHD1 and phosphorylated by CDK1 and CDK2. We found that wild-type (WT) mSAMHD1 and a phospho-ablative mutant, but not a phospho-mimetic mutant, restricted HIV-1 infection in differentiated U937 cells. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection of dividing NIH3T3 cells was modestly restricted by mSAMHD1 WT and phospho-mutants, but not by a dNTPase-defective mutant.

Laboratories may create their own cutoff, a percentage of positive nuclei to determine whether a specimen is positive or negative, to eliminate false positives that are created by signal overlap in most cases. In some cases, it is difficult to determine the cutoff value because of differences in both the area of nuclei and the number of signals. To address these problems, we established two mathematical models using probability theory. To verify these two models, normal disomy cells from healthy individuals were used to simulate cells with different numbers of signals by hybridization with different probes. We used an X/Y probe to obtain the average distance between two signals and the probability of signal overlap in different nuclei area. Frequencies of all signal patterns were scored and compared with theoretical frequencies, and models were assessed using a goodness of fit test. We used five BCR/ABL1-positive samples, 20 BCR/ABL1-negative samples and two samples with ambiguous results to verify the cutoff calibrated by these two models. The models were in agreement with experimental results. The dynamic cutoff can classify cases in routine analysis correctly, and it can also correct for influences from nuclei area and the number of signals in some ambiguous cases. The probability models can be used to assess the effect of signal overlap and calibrate the cutoff.","['Du, Qinghua', 'Li, Qingshan', 'Sun, Daochun', 'Chen, Xiaoyan', 'Yu, Bizhen', 'Ying, Yi']","['Du Q', 'Li Q', 'Sun D', 'Chen X', 'Yu B', 'Ying Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'School of Mathematics Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

We identified 17 microRNAs that were downregulated in ETV6/RUNX1+ compared with ETV6/RUNX1- clinical samples. Among these microRNAs, miR-181a-1 was the most significantly reduced (by ~75%; P < 0.001). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that ETV6/RUNX1 directly binds the regulatory region of MIR181A1, and knockdown of ETV6/RUNX1 increased miR-181a-1 level. We further showed that miR-181a (functional counterpart of miR-181a-1) could target ETV6/RUNX1 and cause a reduction in the level of the oncoprotein ETV6/RUNX1, cell growth arrest, an increase in apoptosis, and induction of cell differentiation in ETV6/RUNX1+ cell line. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-181a also resulted in decreased CD10 hyperexpression in ETV6/RUNX1+ primary patient samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that MIR181A1 and ETV6/RUNX1 regulate each other, and we propose that a double negative loop involving MIR181A1 and ETV6/RUNX1 may contribute to ETV6/RUNX1-driven arrest of differentiation in pre-B ALL.","['Yang, Yung-Li', 'Yen, Ching-Tzu', 'Pai, Chen-Hsueh', 'Chen, Hsuan-Yu', 'Yu, Sung-Liang', 'Lin, Chien-Yu', 'Hu, Chung-Yi', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Lin, Shu-Rung', 'Lin, Shu-Wha']","['Yang YL', 'Yen CT', 'Pai CH', 'Chen HY', 'Yu SL', 'Lin CY', 'Hu CY', 'Jou ST', 'Lin DT', 'Lin SR', 'Lin SW']","['Departments of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Bioscience Technology, College of Science, Chung-Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Center for Nanotechnology and Center for Biomedical Technology, College of Science, Chung-Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Departments of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0142863 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-40002 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 18;10(11):e0142863. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142863. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4651427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Frequencies of BCR-ABL1 mutations and the impact of mutations on responses to 2G-TKIs were obtained from published literature and used as inputs in a decision analytics model. Complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were estimated after 12 months of 2G-TKI treatment. Total annual 2G-TKI drug costs per CHR and MCyR were estimated and compared among 3 2G-TKI access scenarios: (1) open access to both 2G-TKIs; (2) access restricted to dasatinib (DASA-only); and (3) access restricted to nilotinib (NILO-only). RESULTS: Among a hypothetical cohort of 1000 2G-TKI-treated chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, the percentage of patients with CHR and MCyR were greatest for the open access plan (CHR: 93%, MCyR: 56%), followed by DASA-only (88%, 53%) and NILO-only (67%, 47%). Compared with the 2G-TKI costs per CHR in open access ($120,706/CHR), the costs were 5% higher ($126,753/CHR) in DASA-only and 41% higher ($169,990/CHR) in NILO-only. Likewise, compared with the 2G-TKI costs per MCyR in open access ($198,284/MCyR), the costs were 6% higher ($209,259/MCyR) in DASA-only and 22% higher ($241,515/MCyR) in NILO-only.

A Case Report.,424-427,,"A 13-year-old girl presented with significant weight loss, depression, anemia, and neutropenia. The preliminary diagnosis was anorexia nervosa combined with depression. Due to peripheral cytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was performed to rule out leukemia. Lupus erythematosus (LE) cells were found in the bone marrow aspirate, which prompted autoantibody testing, although clinically it was not suspected the patient had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Further testing demonstrated very high levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (>12 U) and anti-double strand DNA (dsNDA) (>1000 IU/mL), which confirmed the diagnosis of SLE. The patient was treated with steroids for SLE, and symptoms improved quickly. In conclusion, although the identification of LE cells as one of the diagnostic criteria for SLE has been obsolete, careful examination of bone marrow to identify LE cells is still very important in the diagnosis of unsuspected SLE.","['Xu, Min', 'MacNeal, Lucinda A', 'Wittman, Brenda J', 'Rutledge, Joe C']","['Xu M', 'MacNeal LA', 'Wittman BJ', 'Rutledge JC']","[""1 Department of Laboratories, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA."", '2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '3 Department of Family Medicine3 Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, AK, USA.', '4 Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, AK, USA.', ""1 Department of Laboratories, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA."", '2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20151118,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Depression/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/complications/*diagnosis', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Weight Loss']",2015/11/19 06:00,2017/06/20 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2350/15-08-1695-CR.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2016 Sep/Oct;19(5):424-427. doi: 10.2350/15-08-1695-CR.1.

Nevertheless, the efficiency of this stimulation is not high enough to inhibit tumor growth completely. In addition to recognition of the cognate antigen, optimal T-cell stimulation requires signals from so-called co-stimulatory molecules. Several members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily have been identified as co-stimulatory molecules that can augment antitumor immune responses. OX40 (CD134) and OX40 ligand (OX40L = CD252; also known as tumor necrosis factor ligand family member 4) is one example of such receptor/ligand pair with co-stimulatory function. In the present investigation, we generated OX40L transgenic Ewing sarcoma cells and tested their immunostimulatory activity in vitro. OX40L transgenic Ewing sarcoma cells showed preserved expression of Ewing sarcoma-associated (anti)gens including lipase member I, cyclin D1 (CCND1), cytochrome P450 family member 26B1 (CYP26B1), and the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWSR1-FLI1) oncogene. OX40L-expressing tumor cells showed a trend for enhanced immune stimulation against Ewing sarcoma cells in combination with IL-2 and stimulation of CD137. Our data suggest that inclusion of the OX40/OX40L pathway of co-stimulation might improve immunotherapy strategies for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma.","['Reuter, Dajana', 'Staege, Martin S', 'Kuhnol, Caspar D', 'Foll, Jurgen']","['Reuter D', 'Staege MS', 'Kuhnol CD', 'Foll J']","['University Clinic and Polyclinic for Child and Adolescent Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg , Halle , Germany.', 'University Clinic and Polyclinic for Child and Adolescent Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg , Halle , Germany.', 'University Clinic and Polyclinic for Child and Adolescent Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg , Halle , Germany.', 'University Clinic and Polyclinic for Child and Adolescent Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg , Halle , Germany ; Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Regensburg , Regensburg , Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151027,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2015/11/19 06:00,2015/11/19 06:01,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00242 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Oct 27;5:242. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00242. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4621427,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ewing sarcoma', 'OX40/OX40L system', 'co-stimulation', 'immunotherapy', 'tumor necrosis factor (receptor) superfamily']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to EGFR-TKIs is inevitable due to various mechanisms, such as the secondary mutation (T790M), activation of alternative pathways (c-Met, HGF, AXL), aberrance of the downstream pathways (K-RAS mutations, loss of PTEN), impairment of the EGFR-TKIs-mediated apoptosis pathway (BCL2-like 11/BIM deletion polymorphism), histologic transformation, ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter effusion, etc. Here we review and summarize the known resistant mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs and provide potential targets for development of new therapeutic strategies.","['Huang, Lihua', 'Fu, Liwu']","['Huang L', 'Fu L']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150726,Netherlands,Acta Pharm Sin B,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

We found that the two compounds acted synergistically to enhance antiproliferative activity and apoptosis. The combination also decreased the MMP, down-regulated Bcl-2 and pro-proteins of the caspase family, and up-regulated Bax and BID, all of which were reversed by the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha.

Advanced melanoma is often resistant to conventional therapies and has high potential for metastasis and low survival rates. Vemurafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of the BRAF serine-threonine kinase recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with metastatic and unresectable melanomas that carry an activating BRAF (V600E) mutation. Many clinical trials evaluating other therapeutic uses of vemurafenib are still ongoing. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane proteins with important physiological and pharmacological roles. Collectively, they transport and regulate levels of physiological substrates such as lipids, porphyrins and sterols.

The overexpression of three major ABC drug transporters is the most common mechanism for acquired resistance to anticancer drugs. In this review, we highlight some of the recent findings related to the effect of ABC drug transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 on the oral bioavailability of vemurafenib, problems associated with treating melanoma brain metastases and the development of acquired resistance to vemurafenib in cancers harboring the BRAF (V600E) mutation.","['Wu, Chung-Pu', 'V Ambudkar, Suresh']","['Wu CP', 'V Ambudkar S']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan ; Molecular Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan ; Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan.', 'Laboratory of Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140113,Netherlands,Acta Pharm Sin B,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

NBs are believed to facilitate several posttranslational modifications and are key regulators of senescence. PML, the organizer of NBs, is expressed as a number of splice variants that all efficiently recruit p53 partners. However, overexpression of only one of them, PML IV, triggers p53-driven senescence. Here, we show that PML IV specifically binds ARF, a key p53 regulator. Similar to ARF, PML IV enhances global SUMO-1 conjugation, particularly that of p53, resulting in p53 stabilization and activation. ARF interacts with and stabilizes the NB-associated UBC9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme, possibly explaining PML IV-enhanced SUMOylation. These results unexpectedly link two key tumor suppressors, highlighting their convergence for global control of SUMO conjugation, p53 activation, and senescence induction.","['Ivanschitz, Lisa', 'Takahashi, Yuki', 'Jollivet, Florence', 'Ayrault, Olivier', 'Le Bras, Morgane', 'de The, Hugues']","['Ivanschitz L', 'Takahashi Y', 'Jollivet F', 'Ayrault O', 'Le Bras M', 'de The H']","[""University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; INSERM U944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; CNRS UMR 7212, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France;"", ""University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; INSERM U944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; CNRS UMR 7212, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France;"", ""University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; INSERM U944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; CNRS UMR 7212, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France;"", ""CNRS UMR 3306, INSERM U1005, Equipe Avenir, Laboratoire Signalisation, Developpement et Tumeurs Cerebrales, Institut Curie, Campus Universitaire d'Orsay, 91400 Orsay, France;"", ""University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; INSERM U944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; CNRS UMR 7212, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France;"", ""University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; INSERM U944, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; CNRS UMR 7212, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Biochimie, Hopital St. Louis 1, Paris cedex 10, France; College de France, Chaire d'Oncologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, 75005 Paris, France hugues.dethe@inserm.fr.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151102,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Stability', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1507540112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1507540112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Nov 17;112(46):14278-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1507540112.

Regulated proteolytic activity is essential for the orchestration of multiple developmental pathways, and defects in protease activity can account for multiple disease patterns. The highly conserved protease threonine aspartase 1 is a member of such developmental proteases and critically involved in the regulation of complex processes, including segmental identity, head morphogenesis, spermatogenesis, and proliferation. Additionally, threonine aspartase 1 is overexpressed in numerous liquid as well as in solid malignancies. Although threonine aspartase 1 is able to cleave the master regulator mixed lineage leukemia protein as well as other regulatory proteins in humans, our knowledge of its detailed pathobiological function and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to development and disease is still incomplete. Moreover, neither effective genetic nor chemical inhibitors for this enzyme are available so far precluding the detailed dissection of the pathobiological functions of threonine aspartase 1. Here, we review the current knowledge of the structure-function relationship of threonine aspartase 1 and its mechanistic impact on substrate-mediated coordination of the cell cycle and development. We discuss threonine aspartase 1-mediated effects on cellular transformation and conclude by presenting a short overview of recent interference strategies.","['Stauber, Roland H', 'Hahlbrock, Angelina', 'Knauer, Shirley K', 'Wunsch, Desiree']","['Stauber RH', 'Hahlbrock A', 'Knauer SK', 'Wunsch D']","['*Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany; and Institute for Molecular Biology, Centre for Medical Biotechnology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', '*Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany; and Institute for Molecular Biology, Centre for Medical Biotechnology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', '*Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany; and Institute for Molecular Biology, Centre for Medical Biotechnology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', '*Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany; and Institute for Molecular Biology, Centre for Medical Biotechnology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany wuensch@uni-mainz.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151117,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/07/19 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.15-270611 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.15-270611 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2016 Mar;30(3):1012-22. doi: 10.1096/fj.15-270611.

We assessed whether HZ, as a marker of immune suppression, is associated with increased cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in U.S. adults with ages >/= 65 years using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Cases (n = 1,108,986) were people with first cancers identified in cancer registries (1992-2005). Controls (n = 100,000) were cancer-free individuals frequency matched to cases on age, sex, and year of selection. We identified HZ diagnosis using Medicare claims. Logistic regression models were constructed to determine adjusted associations between cancer and HZ. RESULTS: HZ prevalence was modestly higher in cases than controls (1.4% vs. 1.2%). We identified significant associations between HZ and oral cavity/pharyngeal [adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.21], colon (aOR = 1.10), lung (aOR = 1.11), and non-melanoma skin (aOR = 1.46) cancers; myeloma (aOR = 1.38); diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aOR = 1.30); lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (aOR = 1.99); and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (aOR = 1.55). Among solid cancers, HZ was mostly associated with regional and/or distant stage tumors. Associations were strongest when HZ was diagnosed 13 to 35 months before cancer diagnosis/selection; they were significant for some cancers in the 36 to 59 months period, and 60+ months for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (OR = 1.99). CONCLUSION: HZ is associated with modestly increased risk of a few cancers, particularly hematologic malignancies. Associations were strongest at short latency intervals for many cancers, and for regional/distant stages among solid cancers, perhaps reflecting reverse causality. IMPACT: Age-related immune decline does not play a major role in cancer development in older people, but it may be important for some lymphomas.","['Mahale, Parag', 'Yanik, Elizabeth L', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Mahale P', 'Yanik EL', 'Engels EA']","['Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are known to detoxify certain carcinogens. We investigated the roles of green tea consumption and polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 on the risk of adult leukemia, and to determine whether the associations varied within GSTs genotypes. METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was conducted in China, 2008-2013. It comprised 442 incident, hematologically confirmed adult leukemia cases and 442 outpatient controls, individually matched to cases by gender, birth quinquennium and study site. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a validated questionnaire. Genetic polymorphisms were assayed by PCR. RESULTS: An inverse association between green tea consumption and adult leukemia risk was observed. Compared with non-tea drinkers, the adjusted odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) were 0.50 (0.27-0.93), 0.31 (0.17-0.55) and 0.53 (0.29-0.99) for those who, respectively, consumed green tea >20 years, >/=2 cups daily and dried tea leaves >1000 g annually. In assessing the associations by GSTs genotypes, risk reduction associated with green tea consumption was stronger in individuals with the GSTT1-null genotype (OR 0.24; 95 % CI 0.11-0.53) than GSTT1-normal carriers (OR 0.67; 95 % CI 0.42-1.05; P interaction = 0.02). GSTM1 and GSTP1 did not significantly modify the inverse association of leukemia with green tea. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that regular daily green tea consumption may reduce leukemia risk in Chinese adults regardless of GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphic status. The association between green tea and adult leukemia risk varied with GSTT1 genotype and highlights further study.","['Liu, Ping', 'Zhang, Min', 'Xie, Xing', 'Jin, Jie', ""Holman, C D'Arcy J""]","['Liu P', 'Zhang M', 'Xie X', 'Jin J', 'Holman CD']","['School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia, M431, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia. ping.liu@research.uwa.edu.au.', 'School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia, M431, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.', 'Center for Healthcare Resilience and Implementation Science, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Level 6, 75 Talavera Road, Sydney, NSW, 2109, Australia.', ""Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, 310006, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", 'School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia, M431, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20151117,Germany,Eur J Nutr,European journal of nutrition,100888704,"['0 (Tea)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics/prevention & control', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Tea']",2015/11/19 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00394-015-1104-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00394-015-1104-x [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Nutr. 2017 Mar;56(2):603-612. doi: 10.1007/s00394-015-1104-x.

A total of 47 patients [29 therapy-related myelosyspastic syndrome (t-MDS) and 18 therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML)] were recruited to the study. 24 patients were treated with AZA monotherapy and 23 with AZA+entinostat. The median number of administered cycles was 4, significantly higher in patients treated with AZA (6 cycles vs. 3 cycles, P = 0.008). Haematological normalization rates were 46% in monotherapy and 17% in the combination arm. Median overall survivals were 13 and 6 months, respectively. The novel 50 * 10 schedule of azacitidine appears effective, with response rates, when given as single agent, comparable to those for patients with de novo MDS/AML treated on the same protocol. However, the combination of AZA and entinostat was associated with increased toxicity and could not be recommended for treatment of tMN.","['Prebet, Thomas', 'Sun, Zhuoxin', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Zeidan, Amer', 'Greenberg, Peter', 'Herman, James', 'Juckett, Mark', 'Smith, Mitchell R', 'Malick, Lisa', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Czader, Magdalena', 'Figueroa, Maria', 'Gabrilove, Janice', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Prebet T', 'Sun Z', 'Ketterling RP', 'Zeidan A', 'Greenberg P', 'Herman J', 'Juckett M', 'Smith MR', 'Malick L', 'Paietta E', 'Czader M', 'Figueroa M', 'Gabrilove J', 'Erba HP', 'Tallman MS', 'Litzow M', 'Gore SD']","['Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'ECOG-ACRIN Biostatistics Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Hematology Division, Stanford University Cancer Center, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'North Division, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Indiana University Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloane-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and North American Leukemia intergroup'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*drug therapy', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13832 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Feb;172(3):384-91. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13832.

PLK1 knockdown has been shown to block proliferation of leukemic cell lines and the clonogenic potential of tumor cells grown from patients with cancer. PLK1 inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of some tumors. We aim to analyze expression of PLK1 in metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Retrospective analysis of colorectal carcinomas with hepatic metastasis during follow-up receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), based on oxaliplatin. Immunohistochemistry for PLK-1 in paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary and also from the metastasis. 50 patients. 32% showed good histopathological response. 43% of the primaries were positive for PLK1, as opposed to 23.5% of the metastasis. Expression of PLK1 was significantly reduced in metastasis compared with the primaries (p = 0.05), what could be due to therapy or to a phenotypic change of the metastatic nodule. Analysis of the prognostic influence of PLK1 expression showed significant association between PLK1 expression in metastasis and lower overall survival (p = 0.000). We have also found a significant association between PLK1 expression and histopathological response (p = 0.02). All the tumors with high expression of PLK1 showed minor response (11/11). This study shows the association between survival and poor histopathological response to therapy and high expression of PLK1 in metastasis.

Hence, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation assay and focused on cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) among the genes whose expression was up-regulated and whose promoter region was hypomethylated after decitabine (DAC) treatment in vitro. CH25H catalyzes hydroxylation of cholesterol and produces 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC). Although CH25H mRNA expression level was originally low in MDS/leukemia cell lines, exposure to DNMT inhibitors enhanced CH25H mRNA expression. The promoter region of CH25H was originally hypermethylated in HL-60 and MDS-L cells, but DAC treatment induced their hypomethylation together with increased CH25H mRNA expression, activation of CH25H-oxysterol pathway, 25-OHC production and apoptotic cell death. We further confirmed that normal CD34-positive cells revealed hypomethylated status of the promoter region of CH25H gene. CH25H-knockdown by transfection of shRNA lentiviral vector into the cell lines partially protected the cells from DAC-induced cell death. Exogenous addition of 25-OHC suppressed leukemic cell growth. The present study raises a possibility that DNMT inhibitors activate CH25H-oxysterol pathway by their hypomethylating mechanism and induce leukemic cell death. Further investigations of the promoter analysis of CH25H gene and therapeutic effects of DNMT inhibitors on MDS/leukemia will be warranted.","['Tsujioka, Takayuki', 'Yokoi, Akira', 'Itano, Yoshitaro', 'Takahashi, Kentaro', 'Ouchida, Mamoru', 'Okamoto, Shuichiro', 'Kondo, Toshinori', 'Suemori, Shin-ichiro', 'Tohyama, Yumi', 'Tohyama, Kaoru']","['Tsujioka T', 'Yokoi A', 'Itano Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Ouchida M', 'Okamoto S', 'Kondo T', 'Suemori S', 'Tohyama Y', 'Tohyama K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.', 'Eisai Co., Ltd., Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 300-2635, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.', 'Eisai Co., Ltd., Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 300-2635, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Hyogo 670-8524, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.99.38 (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['srep16709 [pii]', '10.1038/srep16709 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Nov 18;5:16709. doi: 10.1038/srep16709.,,PMC4649363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is well accepted that MLV requires cell division to complete its replication cycle, it is not known if ab initio infection of mitotic cells can result in productive infection. This question is highly relevant since the milieu of mitotic cells is markedly different from this of interphase cells; e.g. lacking radial microtubule network and intact nuclear envelope. To follow MLV infection in mitotic and interphase cells in real-time, we employed our recently developed infectious MLV particles with labeled cores, cellular models expressing fluorescence markers of different intracellular compartments and protocols for reversible mitotic arrest of MLV-susceptible cells. RESULTS: Multi-wavelength live cell imaging was employed to simultaneously visualize GFP-labeled MLV cores, DiD-labeled viral or cellular membranes, and fluorescently-labeled microtubules or chromosomes. Cells were imaged either at interphase or upon mitotic arrest with microtubule poisons. Analysis of virus localization and trajectories revealed entry by endocytosis at interphase and mitosis, and correlation between viral mobility parameters and presence or absence of polymerized interphase microtubules. The success of infection of viruses that entered cells in mitosis was evidenced by their ability to reverse transcribe, their targeting to condensed chromosomes in the absence of radial microtubule network, and gene expression upon exit from mitosis. Comparison of infection by N, B or NB -tropic viruses in interphase and mitotic human cells revealed reduced restriction of the N-tropic virus, for infection initiated in mitosis. CONCLUSIONS: The milieu of the mitotic cells supports all necessary requirements for early stages of MLV infection. Such milieu is suboptimal for restriction of N-tropic viruses, most likely by TRIM5alpha.","['Elis, Efrat', 'Ehrlich, Marcelo', 'Bacharach, Eran']","['Elis E', 'Ehrlich M', 'Bacharach E']","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, The George S.

More modest results are reported with less intense regimens like obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Clinical assessment has limited sensitivity in detecting residual disease responsible for subsequent relapse, even including morphologic bone marrow (BM) evaluation. Multicolor flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods can detect minimal residual disease (MRD) to a sensitivity of >/=1:10,000 (10(-4)). Achieving BM MRD-negative complete remission (CR) is associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival; MRD status is the single best posttreatment predictor of long-term outcomes after CIT. Newer oral B-cell receptor signaling pathway inhibitors are highly effective at controlling disease, but best monotherapy responses are typically partial remission, and patients must remain on treatment to maintain disease control. Therapeutic progress is still needed for CLL. We propose that targeting MRD provides opportunity to realize this progress. Achieving BM MRD-negative CR is a prerequisite for long-term unmaintained disease-free survival and potential for cure. We review available methodologies for detecting MRD and correlations with posttreatment outcomes. We discuss the potential utility of MRD to direct individualized therapy. Finally, we discuss the importance of MRD-negative status as a surrogate marker for longer PFS in clinical studies to allow more rapid determination of clinical benefit.","['Thompson, Philip A', 'Wierda, William G']","['Thompson PA', 'Wierda WG']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30532-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-08-634816 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 21;127(3):279-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-08-634816.

Haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with 300 muCi (90)Y-anti-CD45 RIT and CY, without TBI or fludarabine, led to mixed chimeras with 81.3 +/- 10.6% mean donor origin CD8(+) cells detected 1 month after BMT, and remained stable (85.5 +/- 11% mean donor origin CD8(+) cells) 6 months after haploidentical BMT. High chimerism levels were induced across multiple hematopoietic lineages 28 days after haploidentical BMT with 69.3 +/- 14.1%, 75.6 +/- 20.2%, and 88.5 +/- 11.8% CD3(+) T cells, B220(+) B cells, and CD11b(+) myeloid cells, respectively. Fifty percent of SJL leukemia-bearing mice treated with 400 muCi (90)Y-DOTA-30F11, CY, and haploidentical BMT were cured and lived >200 days. Mice treated with 200 muCi (90)Y-DOTA-30F11 had a median overall survival of 73 days, while untreated leukemic mice had a median overall survival of 34 days (P < .001, Mantel-Cox test). RIT-mediated haploidentical BMT without TBI may increase treatment options for aggressive hematologic malignancies.","['Orozco, Johnnie J', 'Kenoyer, Aimee', 'Balkin, Ethan R', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Hamlin, Donald K', 'Wilbur, D Scott', 'Hylarides, Mark D', 'Frost, Sofia H L', 'Mawad, Raya', ""O'Donnell, Paul"", 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Green, Damian J', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Press, Oliver W', 'Pagel, John M']","['Orozco JJ', 'Kenoyer A', 'Balkin ER', 'Gooley TA', 'Hamlin DK', 'Wilbur DS', 'Hylarides MD', 'Frost SH', 'Mawad R', ""O'Donnell P"", 'Sandmaier BM', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Luznik L', 'Green DJ', 'Gopal AK', 'Press OW', 'Pagel JM']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Hematology Division, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;', 'Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; and.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects/*genetics/*immunology/radiation effects', '*Haplotypes/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*administration & dosage', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Radioimmunotherapy/methods', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30541-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-617019 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 21;127(3):352-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-617019.

It is unknown if the cancer chemotherapeutic drug, 6-mercaptopurine (6 MP), produces Leydig cell failure among adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Moreover, it is not known whether Leydig cell failure is due to either a loss of cells or an impairment in their function. Herein, we show, in a subset of childhood cancer survivors, that Leydig cell failure is related to the dose of 6 MP. This was extended, in a murine model, to demonstrate that 6 MP exposure induced caspase 3 activation, and the loss of Leydig cells was independent of Bak and Bax activation. The death of these non-proliferating cells was triggered by 6 MP metabolism, requiring formation of both cytosolic reactive oxygen species and thiopurine nucleotide triphosphates. The thiopurine nucleotide triphosphates (with physiological amounts of dATP) uniquely activated the apoptosome. An ABC transporter (Abcc4/Mrp4) reduced the amount of thiopurines, thereby providing protection for Leydig cells. The studies reported here demonstrate that the apoptosome is uniquely activated by thiopurine nucleotides and suggest that 6 MP induced Leydig cell death is likely a cause of Leydig cell failure in some survivors of childhood cancer.","['Morgan, Jessica A', 'Lynch, John', 'Panetta, John C', 'Wang, Yao', 'Frase, Sharon', 'Bao, Ju', 'Zheng, Jie', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Janke, Laura', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim', 'Schuetz, John D']","['Morgan JA', 'Lynch J', 'Panetta JC', 'Wang Y', 'Frase S', 'Bao J', 'Zheng J', 'Opferman JT', 'Janke L', 'Green DM', 'Chemaitilly W', 'Schuetz JD']","[""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Cellular Imaging Shared Resource, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Cell and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Epidemiology &Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Epidemiology &Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Endocrinology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151118,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Abcc4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosomes)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosomes/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leydig Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['srep16488 [pii]', '10.1038/srep16488 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Nov 18;5:16488. doi: 10.1038/srep16488.,"['U01-1U01CA195547-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2R01GM60904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY000331/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA21745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4649703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: This study evaluates the spectrum of ocular manifestations in acute and chronic leukemias presenting to a tertiary care center in India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Subjects of leukemia presenting to a tertiary care center in India. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study looking at the spectrum of ocular manifestations in all inpatients of acute or chronic leukemia. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The collected data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows software, version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). RESULTS: The study subjects (n = 96) comprised 61 males and 35 females whose age ranged from 18 months to 91 years (mean = 39.73, +/-22.1). There were 79 adults and 17 children, 53 new and 43 existing patients, 68 acute and 28 chronic, 61 myeloid and 35 lymphoid patients. Ocular lesions were found in 42 patients (43.8%). The ocular manifestations of leukemia were significantly (P = 0.01467) more frequent in acute 35/68 (51.9%) than chronic 7/28 (25%) leukemias. Primary or direct leukemic infiltration was seen in 8 (8.3%) subjects while secondary or indirect involvement due to anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperviscosity, total body irradiation, and immunosuppression were seen in 42 (43.8%) subjects. Ocular changes were present in 37/79 (46.8%) adults and 5/17 (29.4%) children (P = 0.09460). Twenty-eight males (28/61) 45.9% and 14/35 (40%) females had ocular manifestations (P = 0.2874). The ocular manifestations were significantly (P = 0.01158) more frequent in myeloid leukemias 32/61 (52.9%) than lymphoid leukemias 10/35 (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic ophthalmic lesions were found in 42/96 (43.8%) patients. Ocular involvement is more often seen in adults, acute and myeloid leukemias. All the primary leukemic manifestations were seen in males. A periodic ophthalmic examination should be mandatory for all leukemic patients, as ocular changes are often picked up in asymptomatic patients.","['Koshy, Jacob', 'John, M Joseph', 'Thomas, Satish', 'Kaur, Gurvinder', 'Batra, Nitin', 'Xavier, Wilson J']","['Koshy J', 'John MJ', 'Thomas S', 'Kaur G', 'Batra N', 'Xavier WJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinal Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJOphthalmol_2015_63_8_659_169789 [pii]', '10.4103/0301-4738.169789 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 2015 Aug;63(8):659-64. doi: 10.4103/0301-4738.169789.,,PMC4687193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, anaphylactic reactions, through the potentiation of mast cell degranulation, have been reported. In the present study, a rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell membrane chromatography coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-ion trap-time of flight-mass spectrometry method was established for screening, analyzing, and identifying the potential anaphylactic components of MaiLuoNing injection. Harpagoside, a potential degranulator of rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells, was retained in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell membrane chromatography. We aimed to evaluate the retained components to determine which of those were capable of inducing degranulation of basophilic leukemia cells. A beta-hexosaminidase assay revealed that harpagoside can induce rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell degranulation in a dose-dependent manner. BLBA/c mice also exhibit passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in response to harpagoside. These results indicate that rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell membrane chromatography coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry is effective in screening for the anaphylactic components of MaiLuoNing injection.","['Han, Shengli', 'Lv, Yanni', 'Xue, Wenjing', 'Cao, Jiao', 'Cui, Ronghua', 'Zhang, Tao']","['Han S', 'Lv Y', 'Xue W', 'Cao J', 'Cui R', 'Zhang T']","[""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""National-Provincial Joint Engineering Research Center for Natural Vascular Medicine Screening & Analysis, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""National-Provincial Joint Engineering Research Center for Natural Vascular Medicine Screening & Analysis, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""National-Provincial Joint Engineering Research Center for Natural Vascular Medicine Screening & Analysis, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""National-Provincial Joint Engineering Research Center for Natural Vascular Medicine Screening & Analysis, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""National-Provincial Joint Engineering Research Center for Natural Vascular Medicine Screening & Analysis, Xi'an, China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""National-Provincial Joint Engineering Research Center for Natural Vascular Medicine Screening & Analysis, Xi'an, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,J Sep Sci,Journal of separation science,101088554,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (mailuoning)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization/*methods']",2015/11/19 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/11/19 06:00'],"['2015/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jssc.201500831 [doi]'],ppublish,J Sep Sci. 2016 Feb;39(3):466-72. doi: 10.1002/jssc.201500831.,,,,"['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the burden of therapy can be substantial, with long-term side-effects, and certain subgroups continue to have a poor outcome. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent discovery of new genetic alterations in high-risk subsets provides targets for precision medicine-based interventions using existing Food and Drug Administration approved agents. Novel immunotherapeutic approaches are being deployed in relapsed ALL, one of the leading causes of cancer cell death in children. Moreover, genomic analysis has charted the evolution of tumor subclones, and relapse-specific alterations now provide a mechanistic explanation for drug resistance, setting the stage for targeted therapy. There is greater recognition that host factors - genetic polymorphisms - influence cancer risk, response to therapy, and toxicity. In the future, it is anticipated that they will be integrated into clinical decision making to maximize cure and minimize side-effects. Recent efforts to limit prophylactic central nervous system irradiation have been successful, thereby sparing many children late neurocognitive impairments.

METHODS: The medical records of hospitalized children between 2010 and 2014 in this hospital were collected and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2014, the number of hospitalized children increased from 7 303 in 2010 to 10 902 in 2014, and the case fatality rate declined from 0.33% to 0.20% (P<0.05). The case fatality rate was highest (0.41%) in infants and lowest (0.11%) in newborns. As for the disease spectrum for these hospitalized children, in 2010, the top three diseases were leukemia, congenital heart disease, and pneumonia; in 2011, the top three diseases were tumor chemotherapy, congenital heart disease, and pneumonia; since 2012, tumor chemotherapy, epilepsy, and pneumonia had remained the top three diseases. The top three causes of death in hospitalized children were congenital malformation (39%, 39/99), tumor (13%, 13/99), and infectious diseases/parasitic diseases (8%, 8/99).

METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was applied to detect IKZF1 gene copy number abnormalities in 180 children diagnosed with BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL. These children were classified into IKZF1 deletion group and IKZF1 normal group according to the presence or absence of IKZF1 gene deletion. The association between IKZF1 copy number abnormalities and prognosis of children with BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among 180 children, 27 (15.0%) had IKZF1 deletion; among the 27 children, 4 had complete deletions of 8 exons of IKZF1 gene, 17 had deletion of exon 1, 3 had deletions of exons 4-7, and 3 children had deletions of exons 2-7. Compared with those in the IKZF1 normal group, children in the IKZF1 deletion group had higher white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of individuals with high risk of minimal residual disease at the first visit. IKZF1 deletions often occurred in BCR/ABL-negative children with no special fusion gene abnormalities. They were frequently accompanied by abnormalities in chromosomes 11, 8, 5, 7, and 21. The analysis with Kaplan-Meier method showed that disease-free survival (DFS) in the IKZF1 deletion group was significantly lower than that in the IKZF1 normal group (0.740 +/- 0.096 vs 0.905 +/- 0.034; P=0.002). Cox analysis showed that after exclusion of sex, age, initial WBC count, cerebrospinal fluid state at the first visit, prednisone response, and chromosome karyotype, IKZF1 deletion still affected the children's DFS (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Some children with BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL have IKZF1 deletion, and IKZF1 deletion is an independent risk factor for DFS in children with BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL.","['Zou, Yao', 'Liu, Xiao-Ming', 'Zhang, Li', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Guo, Ye', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Yang, Wen-Yu', 'Wang, Shu-Chun', 'Ruan, Min', 'Liu, Tian-Feng', 'Zhang, Jia-Yuan', 'Liu, Fang', 'Qi, Ben-Quan', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Zou Y', 'Liu XM', 'Zhang L', 'Chen YM', 'Guo Y', 'Chen XJ', 'Yang WY', 'Wang SC', 'Ruan M', 'Liu TF', 'Zhang JY', 'Liu F', 'Qi BQ', 'Zhu XF']","['Pediatric Blood Disease Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China. xfzhu1981@126.com.']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2015.11.002 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2015 Nov;17(11):1154-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Future advances in personalized medicine will rely on molecular signatures that derive from synthesis of multifarious interdependent molecular quantities requiring robust quantitative methods. However, highly parameterized statistical models when applied in these settings often require a prohibitively large database and are sensitive to proper characterizations of the treatment-by-covariate interactions, which in practice are difficult to specify and may be limited by generalized linear models. In this article, we present a Bayesian predictive framework that enables the integration of a high-dimensional set of genomic features with clinical responses and treatment histories of historical patients, providing a probabilistic basis for using the clinical and molecular information to personalize therapy for future patients. Our work represents one of the first attempts to define personalized treatment assignment rules based on large-scale genomic data. We use actual gene expression data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas in the settings of leukemia and glioma to explore the statistical properties of our proposed Bayesian approach for personalizing treatment selection. The method is shown to yield considerable improvements in predictive accuracy when compared to penalized regression approaches.","['Ma, Junsheng', 'Stingo, Francesco C', 'Hobbs, Brian P']","['Ma J', 'Stingo FC', 'Hobbs BP']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, U.S.A.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, U.S.A.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, U.S.A.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151117,United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Biometry/methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomics', 'Glioma/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*statistics & numerical data']",2015/11/18 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/biom.12448 [doi]'],ppublish,Biometrics. 2016 Jun;72(2):575-83. doi: 10.1111/biom.12448.

One promising approach for SCLC treatment would be to utilize agents targeting molecular abnormalities regulating resistance to apoptosis. BH3 mimetic antagonists, such as ABT-737 and its orally available derivative ABT-263 (navitoclax) have been developed to block the function of pro-survival BCL-2 family members. The sensitivity of SCLC to these drugs varies over a broad range in vitro and in clinical trials. We have previously shown that the expression of Noxa, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein, is a critical determinant of sensitivity to ABT-737. Thus, pharmacological up-regulation of Noxa could enhance cell death induced by the BH3 mimetics. We find that the combination of ABT-263 and a HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, efficiently induces apoptosis in a variety of SCLC cell lines, including ABT-263 resistant cell lines. Cell death induced by combined treatment is Noxa- and/or BIM-dependent in some cell lines but in others appears to be mediated by down-regulation of BCL-XL and release of BAK from BCL-XL and MCL-1. These results suggest that combination of HDAC inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors could be an alternative and effective regimen for SCLC treatment.","['Nakajima, Wataru', 'Sharma, Kanika', 'Hicks, Mark A', 'Le, Ngoc', 'Brown, Rikiara', 'Krystal, Geoffrey W', 'Harada, Hisashi']","['Nakajima W', 'Sharma K', 'Hicks MA', 'Le N', 'Brown R', 'Krystal GW', 'Harada H']","['a Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology , School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA.', 'a Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology , School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA.', 'a Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology , School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA.', 'a Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology , School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA.', 'a Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology , School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University, McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Richmond , Virginia , USA.', 'a Department of Oral and Craniofacial Molecular Biology , School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Vorinostat', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1108485 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016;17(1):27-35. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1108485.,['P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4847809,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-263', 'BCL-2 family', 'BCL-XL', 'Noxa', 'apoptosis', 'small cell lung cancer', 'vorinostat']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578, leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-messenger RNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration.

Tumor selection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles, a phenomenon called preferential allelic imbalance (PAI), has been demonstrated in some cancer types. We developed a novel application of digital PCR termed Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test using Droplet Digital PCR (SMART-ddPCR) for accurate assessment of tumor PAI, and have applied this method to test the hypothesis that heritable SNPs associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may demonstrate tumor PAI. These SNPs are located at CDKN2A (rs3731217) and IKZF1 (rs4132601), genes frequently lost in ALL, and at CEBPE (rs2239633), ARID5B (rs7089424), PIP4K2A (rs10764338), and GATA3 (rs3824662), genes located on chromosomes gained in high-hyperdiploid ALL. We established thresholds of AI using constitutional DNA from SNP heterozygotes, and subsequently measured allelic copy number in tumor DNA from 19-142 heterozygote samples per SNP locus. We did not find significant tumor PAI at these loci, though CDKN2A and IKZF1 SNPs showed a trend towards preferential selection of the risk allele (p = 0.17 and p = 0.23, respectively). Using a genomic copy number control ddPCR assay, we investigated somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) underlying AI at CDKN2A and IKZF1, revealing a complex range of alterations including homozygous and hemizygous deletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, with varying degrees of clonality. Copy number estimates from ddPCR showed high agreement with those from multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assays. We demonstrate that SMART-ddPCR is a highly accurate method for investigation of tumor PAI and for assessment of the somatic alterations underlying AI. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified 16 recurrent SCNA loci that contain heritable cancer risk SNPs associated with a matching tumor type, and which represent candidate PAI regions warranting further investigation.","['de Smith, Adam J', 'Walsh, Kyle M', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Endicott, Alyson A', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['de Smith AJ', 'Walsh KM', 'Hansen HM', 'Endicott AA', 'Wiencke JK', 'Metayer C', 'Wiemels JL']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Allelic Imbalance', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/06/29 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0143343 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-34663 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 17;10(11):e0143343. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143343. eCollection 2015.,"['R01CA155461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4648491,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germline loss-of-function mutations are known to cause hyper-IgE immunodeficiency (autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome), whereas somatic gain-of-function mutations have been described in large granular cell leukemia, and polymorphisms in STAT3 have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other solid organ tumors. The review examines recent discoveries in our understanding of the nonmalignant disease processes affected by STAT3 mutations in human disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations have recently been identified in patients with an early-onset autoimmunity/lymphoproliferative syndrome. STAT3 plays a previously unrecognized role in several facets of the pathogenesis of allergy. Loss-of-function STAT3 mutations revealed critical roles for STAT3 in the development and function of several lymphocyte populations and in their role in host defense. SUMMARY: The discovery of new gain-of-function mutations in STAT3, as well as new studies among patients with loss-of-function mutations, expand the understanding of the pathophysiology of STAT3 function and its importance in regulating the immune system. These findings contribute to elucidating STAT3 biology and clinical symptoms in patients with the different disease phenotypes.","['Forbes, Lisa R', 'Milner, Josh', 'Haddad, Elie']","['Forbes LR', 'Milner J', 'Haddad E']","[""aSection of Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Allergy and Rheumatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Houston, Texas bNational Institutes of Health, Genetics and Pathogenesis of Allergy Section, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, Bethesda, Maryland, USA cDepartment of Pediatrics and Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Infectiology, University of Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada *Josh Milner and Elie Haddad share the senior authorship to the writing of this article.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Infections/genetics/immunology/metabolism/microbiology/virology', 'Interleukin-17/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/immunology/metabolism']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000206 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jan;23(1):23-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000206.,['ZIA AI001098-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4790836,['NIHMS738122'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histiocytic sarcomas rarely occur in the CNS and have not previously been reported in conjunction with prior B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. We report the case of a 23-year-old man who presented with primary CNS HS 7 years after achieving remission for precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Molecular studies revealed clonal immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) gene rearrangement within the HS, suggesting linkage to his previous B-ALL. Previously reported post-ALL HSs show a strong predilection for young males (male-to-female ratio, 20:1), whereas cases of primary CNS HS without previous ALL affected older adults with balanced sex predilection. The patient's survival at 60 months exceeds expectations when compared with that of other reported cases of de novo primary CNS HS (n = 18) and post-ALL HS at all sites (n = 19).

In contrast to the unequivocal importance of HTLV-1 infection in the pathogenesis of ATLL, the role of acquired mutations in HTLV-1 infected T cells has not been fully elucidated, with a handful of genes known to be recurrently mutated. In this study, we identified unique RHOA mutations in ATLL through whole genome sequencing of an index case, followed by deep sequencing of 203 ATLL samples. RHOA mutations showed distinct distribution and function from those found in other cancers. Involving 15% (30/203) of ATLL cases, RHOA mutations were widely distributed across the entire coding sequence but almost invariably located at the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding pocket, with Cys16Arg being most frequently observed. Unexpectedly, depending on mutation types and positions, these RHOA mutants showed different or even opposite functional consequences in terms of GTP/guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-binding kinetics, regulation of actin fibers, and transcriptional activation. The Gly17Val mutant did not bind GTP/GDP and act as a dominant negative molecule, whereas other mutants (Cys16Arg and Ala161Pro) showed fast GTP/GDP cycling with enhanced transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that both loss- and gain-of-RHOA functions could be involved in ATLL leukemogenesis. In summary, our study not only provides a novel insight into the molecular pathogenesis of ATLL but also highlights a unique role of variegation of heterologous RHOA mutations in human cancers.","['Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Kontani, Kenji', 'Enami, Terukazu', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Ishii, Ryohei', 'Totoki, Yasushi', 'Kataoka, Tatsuki R', 'Hirata, Masahiro', 'Aoki, Kazuhiro', 'Nakano, Kazumi', 'Kitanaka, Akira', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Egami, Sachiko', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Tanaka, Hiroko', 'Shiozawa, Yusuke', 'Yoshizato, Tetsuichi', 'Suzuki, Hiromichi', 'Kon, Ayana', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Sato, Yusuke', 'Sato-Otsubo, Aiko', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Munakata, Wataru', 'Nakamura, Hiromi', 'Hama, Natsuko', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Nureki, Osamu', 'Shibata, Tatsuhiro', 'Haga, Hironori', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Katada, Toshiaki', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Ogawa, Seishi']","['Nagata Y', 'Kontani K', 'Enami T', 'Kataoka K', 'Ishii R', 'Totoki Y', 'Kataoka TR', 'Hirata M', 'Aoki K', 'Nakano K', 'Kitanaka A', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Egami S', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Chiba K', 'Tanaka H', 'Shiozawa Y', 'Yoshizato T', 'Suzuki H', 'Kon A', 'Yoshida K', 'Sato Y', 'Sato-Otsubo A', 'Sanada M', 'Munakata W', 'Nakamura H', 'Hama N', 'Miyano S', 'Nureki O', 'Shibata T', 'Haga H', 'Shimoda K', 'Katada T', 'Chiba S', 'Watanabe T', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Physiological Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan;', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Division of Cancer Genomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Pathology and Biology of Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan;

The SRR analysis compared outcomes among tertiles of estimated cumulative potential styrene exposure. RESULTS: Overall, 598 deaths (SMR=0.96, CI 0.89 to 1.04) included excess lung (SMR=1.23, CI 0.95 to 1.56) and ovarian cancer (SMR 3.08, CI 1.00 to 7.19), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (SMR=1.15, CI 0.81 to 1.58). Among 580 workers with potential high-styrene exposure, COPD mortality increased 2-fold (SMR=2.02, CI 1.08 to 3.46). CONCLUSIONS: COPD was more pronounced among those with potential high-styrene exposure. However, no outcome was related to estimated cumulative styrene exposure, and there was no change when latency was taken into account. We found no excess leukaemia or lymphoma mortality. As in most occupational cohort studies, lack of information on lifestyle factors or other employment was a substantial limitation although we excluded from the analyses those (n=3525) who worked <1 year. Unanticipated excess ovarian cancer mortality could be a chance finding. Comparing subcohorts with potential high-styrene and low-styrene exposure, COPD mortality SRR was elevated while lung cancer SRR was not, suggesting that smoking was not the only cause for excess COPD mortality.","['Ruder, Avima M', 'Meyers, Alysha R', 'Bertke, Stephen J']","['Ruder AM', 'Meyers AR', 'Bertke SJ']","['Industrywide Studies Branch, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Industrywide Studies Branch, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Industrywide Studies Branch, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151116,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Plastics)', '0 (Solvents)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/etiology/mortality', 'Male', '*Manufacturing Industry', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/mortality', 'Plastics', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/etiology/*mortality', '*Ships', 'Smoking', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Styrene/*adverse effects', 'Washington/epidemiology', 'Work', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2015-102990 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2015-102990 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2016 Feb;73(2):97-102. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2015-102990.

CAR-modified T cells targeting CD19 have shown remarkable activity against CD19+ malignancies including B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Complete remission rates as high as 90% have been observed for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL and greater than 50% response rates have been seen in heavily pre-treated CLL and NHL. Excitingly, some remissions have been durable without any additional therapy, a finding which correlates with in-vivo T-cell persistence and B-cell aplasia. The major treatment related toxicities include B-cell aplasia, neurologic toxicities, and a potentially severe cytokine release syndrome.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rare in children; and thus, this study profiled lncRNA expression in bone marrow samples from pediatric AML patients. Arraystar Human LncRNA Array V3.0 was used to profile differentially expressed lncRNAs in three bone marrow samples obtained from each pediatric AML patient and normal controls. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm dysregulated lncRNA expressions in 22 AML bone marrow samples. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to construct the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network. A total of 372 dysregulated lncRNAs (difference >/=10-fold) were found in pediatric AML patients compared to normal controls. Fifty-one mRNA levels were significantly upregulated, while 85 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated by >10-fold in pediatric AML, compared to normal controls. GO terms and KEGG pathway annotation data revealed that cell cycle pathway-related genes were significantly associated with pediatric AML. As confirmed by qRT-PCR, expression of 24 of 97 lncRNA was altered in pediatric AML compared to normal controls. In pediatric AML, ENST00000435695 was the most upregulated lncRNA, while ENST00000415964 was the most downregulated lncRNA. Data from this study revealed dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in pediatric AML versus normal controls that could form gene pathways to regulate cell cycle progression and immunoresponse. Further studies are required to determine whether these lncRNAs could serve as novel therapeutic targets and bbdiagnostic biomarkers in pediatric AML.","['Cao, Lan', 'Xiao, Pei-Fang', 'Tao, Yan-Fang', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Lu, Jun', 'Zhao, Wen-Li', 'Li, Zhi-Heng', 'Wang, Na-Na', 'Wang, Jian', 'Feng, Xing', 'Chai, Yi-Huan', 'Pan, Jian', 'Gu, Gui-Xiong']","['Cao L', 'Xiao PF', 'Tao YF', 'Hu SY', 'Lu J', 'Zhao WL', 'Li ZH', 'Wang NN', 'Wang J', 'Feng X', 'Chai YH', 'Pan J', 'Gu GX']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.R.

However, its precise role and mechanism in CD44+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cancer stem-like cells (CSC-LCs) remain poorly understood. In our previous study, we successfully silenced Bmi-1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in CD44+ NPC CSC-LCs and obtained stable Bmi-1 knockdown (KD) cell lines. In the present study, we tested the cell proliferation by CCK-8 assay and apoptosis by fl ow cytometry. Scratch wound healing assay, together with Transwell migration and invasion assays were used to measure the migration and invasion capacity. We further evaluated the tumorigenicity of CD44+ NPC CSC-LCs transfected with Bmi-1 shRNA in vivo. Based on our results, knockdown of Bmi-1 by shRNA resulted in the inhibition of tumor proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, followed by cell apoptosis. In addition, our results preliminarily demonstrated that inhibition of Bmi-1 expression by shRNA increased tumor apoptosis through the p16INK4a-p14ARF-p53 pathway. Bmi-1 silencing in CD44+ NPC CSC-LCs also resulted in the failure to develop tumors in vivo. These results provide important insights into the role of Bmi-1 in the occurrence and development of NPC. Based on our findings, regulation of Bmi-1 in CD44+ NPC CSC-LCs may provide a potential molecular target for the therapy of NPC, and targeted silencing of Bmi-1 by shRNA may have clinical future implications in NPC therapy.","['Xu, Xinhua', 'Liu, Yang', 'Su, Jin', 'Li, Daojun', 'Hu, Juan', 'Huang, Qiao', 'Lu, Mingqian', 'Liu, Xiaoyan', 'Ren, Jinghua', 'Chen, Weihong', 'Sun, Lidan']","['Xu X', 'Liu Y', 'Su J', 'Li D', 'Hu J', 'Huang Q', 'Lu M', 'Liu X', 'Ren J', 'Chen W', 'Sun L']","[""The First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University and Department of Oncology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, Yichang, Hubei 443003, P.R.

The purpose of this study was to define and validate health states experienced by adults with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL, and to assign utility values to these health states using time-trade off methodology. METHODS: This study was conducted in the UK in three phases. In the first phase, five health state descriptions were developed based on a recent clinical trial. The second phase validated the health state descriptions with clinicians and patients with experience of relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The third phase involved prospective health state valuation using time-trade off methodology in a sample of the general public. The study was approved by the UK National Health Service Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: In total, 123 participants were recruited and included in the final analysis; all participants gave written, informed consent. Complete remission was the most preferred health state (mean utility [SEM], 0.86 [0.01]), followed by complete remission with partial hematological recovery (with minimal risk of bleeding or developing infection) (0.75 [0.02]); aplastic bone marrow (0.59 [0.02]); partial remission (0.50 [0.03]); and progressive disease (0.30 [0.04]). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report utility values for health states associated with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. It was designed and conducted to align with NICE guidance on alternative methods for generating health state utility values when EQ-5D data are either unavailable or inappropriate. These utilities can be applied in future cost-effectiveness analyses of treatment for relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL.","['Aristides, Mike', 'Barlev, Arie', 'Barber, Beth', 'Gijsen, Merel', 'Quinn, Casey']","['Aristides M', 'Barlev A', 'Barber B', 'Gijsen M', 'Quinn C']","['PRMA Consulting, Fleet, UK.

Prior to the development of targeted therapies and in the absence of allogeneic haematopoetic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), the median survival was 5-7 years. HSCT was quickly established as the standard of care for eligible patients through the 1980s and 1990s, when considerable advances were made in the optimization of conditioning regimens and supportive care. Exploiting a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of CML, the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the late 1990s revolutionized the management of the disease. TKIs offer the prospect of long-term disease control with a simple oral therapy, and are the first-line treatment in the 21(st) century. The majority of patients treated with TKIs achieve excellent responses with sustained treatment, and some even continue to have undetectable or exceptionally low level disease upon TKI withdrawal; however, for an almost equal number of patients, an adequate response cannot be achieved with any of the currently available TKIs. For those patients who fail to respond adequately to TKIs, HSCT offers the best prospect of long-term survival.","['Innes, Andrew J', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Apperley, Jane F']","['Innes AJ', 'Milojkovic D', 'Apperley JF']","['Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, London W12 0NN, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151117,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

In the present study, we investigated whether the EGR-1 pathway is involved in the regulation of Tax-induced JNK expression in human Jurkat T cells transfected to express the Tax protein in the presence or absence of PMA or ionomycin. Overexpression of EGR-1 in Jurkat cells transfected to express Tax, promoted the activation of several genes, with the most potent being those that contained AP-1 (Jun/c-Fos), whereas knockdown of endogenous EGR-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) somewhat reduced Tax-mediated JNK-1 transcription. Additionally, luciferase-based AP-1 and NF-kappaB reporter gene assays demonstrated that inhibition of EGR-1 expression by an siRNA did not affect the transcriptional activity of a consensus sequence of either AP-1 or NF-kappaB. On the other hand, the apoptosis assay, using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as an inducer of apoptosis, confirmed that siRNA against EGR-1 failed to suppress ATRA-induced apoptosis in Jurkat and Jurkat-Tax cells, as noted by the low levels of both DEVDase activity and DNA fragmentation, indicating that the induction of apoptosis by ATRA was Egr-1-independent. Finally, our data showed that activation of Tax by JNK-1 was not dependent on the EGR-1 cascade of events, suggesting that EGR-1 is important but not a determinant for the activity for Tax-induced proliferation of Jurkat cells.","['Parra, Eduardo', 'Gutierrez, Luis', 'Ferreira, Jorge']","['Parra E', 'Gutierrez L', 'Ferreira J']","['Laboratory of Experimental Biomedicine, University of Tarapaca, Campus Esmeralda, Iquique, Chile.', 'Faculty of Sciences, University Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile.', 'Programme of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, ICBM, Medical Faculty, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151116,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/10/19 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.4424 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Feb;35(2):1163-9. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.4424.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with metastatic ccRCC treated with first-line pazopanib from 1 November 2009 through to 1 November 2012. Cox models were fitted to evaluate the association of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with patient co-variables. RESULTS: In all, 88 patients were identified; 74 were evaluable for response: two (3%) had a complete response, 27 (36%) a partial response, 36 (49%) had stable disease and nine (12%) had progressive disease. The median PFS was 13.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.7-18.3]. PFS was correlated with a Karnofsky Performance Status score of <80 [hazard ratio (HR) 3.26, P < 0.001] and serum lactate dehydrogenase of >1.5 x upper limit of normal (HR 3.25, P = 0.014). The median OS was 29.1 months (95% CI 20.2-not reached). The OS was correlated with brain metastasis (HR 2.55, P = 0.009), neutrophilia (HR 1.179, P = 0.018), and anaemia (HR 3.51, P < 0.001). There were no treatment-related deaths. In all, 53 patients received second-line therapy [vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKI) in 22 patients, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) in 22 patients, and other therapy in nine patients]; the median PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI 3.3-25.7) with VEGFR-TKI and 5 months (95% CI 3.5-15.2) with mTORi (P = 0.41); the median OS was 19.9 months (95% CI 12.9-not reached) and 14.2 months (95% CI 8.1-not reached), from initiation of second-line VEGFR-TKI or mTORi, respectively (P = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, first-line pazopanib confirmed its efficacy in metastatic ccRCC. Trends for longer PFS and OS were seen with VEGFR-TKI compared with mTORi after first-line pazopanib.","['Matrana, Marc R', 'Bathala, Tharakeswara', 'Campbell, Matthew T', 'Duran, Cihan', 'Shetty, Aditya', 'Teegavarapu, Purnima', 'Kalra, Sarathi', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Atkinson, Bradley', 'Corn, Paul', 'Jonasch, Eric', 'Tannir, Nizar M']","['Matrana MR', 'Bathala T', 'Campbell MT', 'Duran C', 'Shetty A', 'Teegavarapu P', 'Kalra S', 'Xiao L', 'Atkinson B', 'Corn P', 'Jonasch E', 'Tannir NM']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology Fellowship, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Emergency Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Quantitative Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Programs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151213,England,BJU Int,BJU international,100886721,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '7RN5DR86CK (pazopanib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indazoles', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/18 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bju.13374 [doi]'],ppublish,BJU Int. 2016 Aug;118(2):264-71. doi: 10.1111/bju.13374.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Karyotypes of 916 pediatric patients with t(8;21)-AML were reviewed for the presence of additional cytogenetic aberrations, and 228 samples were screened for presence of cKIT and RAS mutations. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the relevance of anthracyclines, cytarabine, and etoposide during induction and overall treatment. End points were the probability of achieving complete remission, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), probability of event-free survival, and probability of overall survival. RESULTS: Of 838 patients included in final analyses, 92% achieved complete remission. The 5-year overall survival, event-free survival, and CIR were 74%, 58%, and 26%, respectively. cKIT mutations and RAS mutations were not significantly associated with outcome. Patients with deletions of chromosome arm 9q [del(9q); n = 104] had a lower probability of complete remission (P = .01). Gain of chromosome 4 (+4; n = 21) was associated with inferior CIR and survival (P < .01). Anthracycline doses greater than 150 mg/m(2) and etoposide doses greater than 500 mg/m(2) in the first induction course and high-dose cytarabine 3 g/m(2) during induction were associated with better outcomes on various end points. Cumulative doses of cytarabine greater than 30 g/m(2) and etoposide greater than 1,500 mg/m(2) were associated with lower CIR rates and better probability of event-free survival. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with t(8;21)-AML and additional del(9q) or additional +4 might not be considered at good risk. Patients with t(8;21)-AML likely benefit from protocols that have high doses of anthracyclines, etoposide, and cytarabine during induction, as well as from protocols comprising cumulative high doses of cytarabine and etoposide.","['Klein, Kim', 'Kaspers, Gertjan', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Reedijk, Ardine', 'Bongers, Mathilda', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Zimmerman, Martin', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Johnston, Donna', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Zapotocky, Michal', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Fynn, Alcira', 'Lee, Vincent', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Salgado, Carmen', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Popa, Alexander', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Gibson, Brenda']","['Klein K', 'Kaspers G', 'Harrison CJ', 'Beverloo HB', 'Reedijk A', 'Bongers M', 'Cloos J', 'Pession A', 'Reinhardt D', 'Zimmerman M', 'Creutzig U', 'Dworzak M', 'Alonzo T', 'Johnston D', 'Hirsch B', 'Zapotocky M', 'De Moerloose B', 'Fynn A', 'Lee V', 'Taga T', 'Tawa A', 'Auvrignon A', 'Zeller B', 'Forestier E', 'Salgado C', 'Balwierz W', 'Popa A', 'Rubnitz J', 'Raimondi S', 'Gibson B']","[""Kim Klein, Gertjan Kaspers, Jacqueline Cloos, and Mathilda Bongers, Vrije Universiteit University Medical Center Amsterdam; Gertjan Kaspers and Ardine Reedijk, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague; H.

The aim of this paper was to review all recent articles on noma from January 2003 to August 2014 and briefly update the latest information related to the topic. A literature search was done on PUBMED using the keywords ""noma/cancrum oris"". Noma is commonly seen in malnourished children. There has been an increased incidence of noma in HIV patients. Apart from these, noma has also been reported in association with cyclic neutropenia, herpetic stomatitis, leukemia, Down's syndrome and Burkett's disease. Treatment of acute noma includes transfusion of blood and intravenous fluids, administration of antibiotics, putting the patient on a high protein diet and debridement of necrotic areas. Surgical phase is usually initiated 6 to 18 months after a period of quiescence. Although, the mortality rate associated with noma has reduced significantly with the advent of modern generation antibiotics, the functional, cosmetic and psychological challenges associated with the destruction of soft or hard tissues still remains a huge challenge. Adequate steps must be implemented by the government or medical professionals to prevent the disease and provide an early intervention.","['Ashok, Nipun', 'Tarakji, Bassel', 'Darwish, Shourouk', 'Rodrigues, Jean C', 'Altamimi, Mohammad A']","['Ashok N', 'Tarakji B', 'Darwish S', 'Rodrigues JC', 'Altamimi MA']",['. nipunashok@gmail.com.'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150730,Canada,Glob J Health Sci,Global journal of health science,101519495,,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Noma/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2015/11/18 06:00,2016/06/29 06:00,['2015/11/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5539/gjhs.v8n4p53 [doi]'],epublish,Glob J Health Sci. 2015 Jul 30;8(4):53-9. doi: 10.5539/gjhs.v8n4p53.,,PMC4873589,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the mechanism and the function of miR19153p in the apoptotic regulation of lung cancer cell lines (NCIH441 and NCIH1650) were investigated. The expression analysis confirmed that the expression of miR19153p was markedly decreased in the apoptotic cells. The overexpression of miR19153p in the lung cancer cells prevented apoptosis induced by etoposide. Developmentally regulated GTPbinding protein 2 (DRG2) and preB cell leukemia homeobox 2 (PBX2) were identified as downstream targets of miR19153p, which was shown to bind directly to the 3'untranslated region of DRG2 and PBX2, subsequently lowering their mRNA and protein expression levels. Coexpression of miR19153p and DRG2/PBX2 in the NCIH441 and NCIH1650 cells partly circumvented the effect of miR19153p on apoptosis. The results in the present study revealed that miR19153p functions as a silencer of apoptosis, which regulates lung cancer apoptosis via targeting DRG2/PBX2, and consequently this miRNA may be a putative therapeutic target in lung cancer.","['Xu, Chengshan', 'Li, Hengheng', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Jia, Tianjun', 'Duan, Lianning', 'Lu, Chengrong']","['Xu C', 'Li H', 'Zhang L', 'Jia T', 'Duan L', 'Lu C']","['Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, P.R.

SMARCA4/BRG1, a core component of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex, has been implicated by its mutational spectrum as exerting a tumour-suppressor function in many solid tumours; recently however, it has been reported to sustain leukaemogenic transformation in MLL-rearranged leukaemia in mice. Here we further explore the role of SMARCA4 and the two SWI/SNF subunits SMARCD2/BAF60B and DPF2/BAF45D in leukaemia. We observed the selective requirement for these proteins for leukaemic cell expansion and self-renewal in-vitro as well as in leukaemia. Gene expression profiling in human cells of each of these three factors suggests that they have overlapping functions in leukaemia. The gene expression changes induced by loss of the three proteins demonstrate that they are required for the expression of haematopoietic stem cell associated genes but in contrast to previous results obtained in mouse cells, the three proteins are not required for the expression of c-MYC regulated genes.","['Cruickshank, V Adam', 'Sroczynska, Patrycja', 'Sankar, Aditya', 'Miyagi, Satoru', 'Rundsten, Carsten Friis', 'Johansen, Jens Vilstrup', 'Helin, Kristian']","['Cruickshank VA', 'Sroczynska P', 'Sankar A', 'Miyagi S', 'Rundsten CF', 'Johansen JV', 'Helin K']","['Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Danish Stem Cell Centre (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Danish Stem Cell Centre (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151116,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DPF2 protein, human)', '0 (DPF2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SMARCD2 protein, human)', '0 (SWI-SNF-B chromatin-remodeling complex)', '0 (Smarcd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Smarca4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Muscle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2015/11/17 06:00,2016/06/22 06:00,['2015/11/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0142806 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-18562 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 16;10(11):e0142806. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142806. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4646637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the regulation network of splenic miRNAs altered by acute infection with T. gondii, we herein investigated the changes of miRNA profile in mouse spleen via next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 379 miRNAs was identified, 131 miRNAs of them were differentially expressed (including 97 upregulated and 34 downregulated miRNAs). 48 differentially expressed miRNAs had validated targets in the miRWalk2.0 database. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that the validated targets of differently expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in gene transcription regulation. It suggested that T. gondii can modulate host gene expression through targeting to trans-regulation factors. The genes involved in apoptosis or anti-apoptosis were both targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. The change of power balance between the miRNAs targeting host apoptosis genes and those regulating host anti-apoptosis genes contributes to the fate of host apoptosis process. Twelve pathways were significantly enriched in KEGG analysis with most of them being cancer related, including pathways in cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, axon guidance, MAPK signaling pathway, focal adhesion, chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, glioma, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and Wnt signaling pathway. Our study showed a changed miRNA regulation network in mouse spleen infected by T. gondii. These findings will be helpful for better understanding of miRNA regulation network in host-T. gondii interaction, revealing the relationship among T. gondii infection, gene regulation, apoptosis and cancer process alterations in infected spleen.","['He, Jun-Jun', 'Ma, Jun', 'Wang, Jin-Lei', 'Xu, Min-Jun', 'Zhu, Xing-Quan']","['He JJ', 'Ma J', 'Wang JL', 'Xu MJ', 'Zhu XQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitology of Gansu Province, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitology of Gansu Province, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China; College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, Hunan Province 410128, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitology of Gansu Province, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Key Laboratory of Veterinary Parasitology of Gansu Province, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China; College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province 510642, PR China.

At least two cysteines close together in the amino acid sequence are crucial to the binding of arsenic and essential to the identification of arsenic-binding proteins. In the present study, arsenic binding proteins were pulled down with streptavidin and identified using a liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). More than 40 arsenic-binding proteins were separated, and redox-related proteins, glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), heat shock 70 kDa protein 9 (HSPA9) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), were further studied using binding assays in vitro. Notably, PKM2 has a high affinity for arsenic. In contrast to PKM2, GSTP1and HSPA9 did not combine with arsenic directly in vitro. These observations suggest that arsenic-mediated acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) suppressive effects involve PKM2. In summary, we identified several arsenic binding proteins in APL cells and investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of arsenic trioxide for APL. Further investigation into specific signal pathways by which PKM2 mediates APL developments may lead to a better understanding of arsenic effects on APL.","['Zhang, Tao', 'Lu, Haojie', 'Li, Weijun', 'Hu, Ronggui', 'Chen, Zi']","['Zhang T', 'Lu H', 'Li W', 'Hu R', 'Chen Z']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, 12 Central Urumqi Road, Shanghai 200040, China. shmuzt@126.com.', 'Shanghai Cancer Center and Key Laboratory of Glycoconjugates Research Ministry of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China. luhaojie@fudan.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China. drchenzi2@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China. coryhu@sibs.ac.cn.', 'Cancer Research Center, SIBS-Xuhui Central Hospital, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China. coryhu@sibs.ac.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China. drchenzi@tom.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151110,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '0 (thyroid hormone-binding proteins)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Biotin/chemistry', 'Biotinylation', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Oxides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Streptavidin/chemistry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Thyroid Hormones/chemistry/*isolation & purification']",2015/11/17 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/11/17 06:00'],"['2015/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms161125994 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms161125994 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2015 Nov 10;16(11):26871-9. doi: 10.3390/ijms161125994.,,PMC4661853,,,['NOTNLM'],"['LC-MS/MS', 'acute promyelocytic leukaemia', 'arsenic-binding protein', 'arsenic-biotin', 'pyruvate kinase M2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve bioavailability and increase potency of tangeretin, its derivative, 5-acetyloxy-6,7,8,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (5-AcTMF), has been synthesized and shown potent inhibition of proliferation activity against human breast and leukemia cancer cell lines. In this study, we have further investigated the anticancer effects of 5-AcTMF on CL1-5 non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that 5-AcTMF effectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation, induced G2/M-phase arrest associated with cdc2 and CDC25c and increased in the apoptotic cells associated with caspase activation, down regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP and Survivn, inducing release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. We also found that 5-AcTMF treatment of CL1-5 activated autophagy, indicated by triggered autophagosome formation and increased LC3-II levels and formation of LC3 puncta. Moreover, we also found that 5-AcTMF lowered phophoatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Over-expression of AKT by AKT cDNA transfection decreased 5-AcTMF mediated apoptosis and autophagy, supporting the induction of apoptosis and autophagy by inhibition of AKT pathway. In an animal study, 5-AcTMF effectively delayed tumor growth in a nude mouse model of CL1-5 xenografts without observed adverse effect. Immunohistochemistry Analysis indicated that 5-AcTMF induced CL1-5 cell apoptosis and autophagy in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 5-AcTMF is a novel small molecule agent that can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, and induce G(2)/M phase arrest and via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and autophagy.","['Li, Yi Rong', 'Li, Shiming', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Chang, Ya-Han', 'Tan, Kok-Tong', 'Chung, Ting-Wen', 'Wang, Bing-Yen', 'Chen, Yu-Kuo', 'Lin, Chi-Chen']","['Li YR', 'Li S', 'Ho CT', 'Chang YH', 'Tan KT', 'Chung TW', 'Wang BY', 'Chen YK', 'Lin CC']","['a Institute of Biomedical Science and Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, National Chung-Hsing University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'b Hubei Key Laboratory for Processing and Application of Catalytic Materials, Huanggang Normal University , Hubei , China.', 'c Department of Food Science , Rutgers University , New Brunswick , NJ , USA.', 'a Institute of Biomedical Science and Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, National Chung-Hsing University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'a Institute of Biomedical Science and Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, National Chung-Hsing University , Taichung , Taiwan.', ""d Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan."", 'e Institute of Bioinformatics and Structural Biology and Department of Medical Sciences, National Tsing Hua University , Hsinchu , Taiwan.', 'f Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital and Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'g Department of Food Science , National Pingtung University of Science and Technology , Pingtung , Taiwan.', 'a Institute of Biomedical Science and Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine, National Chung-Hsing University , Taichung , Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Flavones)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'I4TLA1DLX6 (tangeretin)', 'S2V45N7G3B (flavone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flavones/*administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/biosynthesis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/17 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/11/17 06:00'],"['2015/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1108491 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016;17(1):48-64. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1108491.,,PMC4847812,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""5-Acetyloxy-6,7,8,4'-tetramethoxyflavone"", 'AKT', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy; G2/M arrest', 'non-small cell lung cancer cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an ideal model to address this as (i) patient samples are easily accessible, (ii) the hematopoietic stem and progenitor population (HSPC) where transformation occurs is well characterized, and (iii) loss of the key autophagy gene Atg7 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to a lethal pre-leukemic phenotype in mice. Here we demonstrate that loss of Atg5 results in an identical HSPC phenotype as loss of Atg7, confirming a general role for autophagy in HSPC regulation. Compared to more committed/mature hematopoietic cells, healthy human and mouse HSCs displayed enhanced basal autophagic flux, limiting mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species in this long-lived population. Taken together, with our previous findings these data are compatible with autophagy limiting leukemic transformation. In line with this, autophagy gene losses are found within chromosomal regions that are commonly deleted in human AML. Moreover, human AML blasts showed reduced expression of autophagy genes, and displayed decreased autophagic flux with accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria indicating that deficient autophagy may be beneficial to human AML. Crucially, heterozygous loss of autophagy in an MLL-ENL model of AML led to increased proliferation in vitro, a glycolytic shift, and more aggressive leukemias in vivo.

The potential mechanisms for the observed increase in risk, including alterations in leptin and adiponectin, pancreatic insufficiency, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyle, and perhaps changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, are reviewed.

METHODS: Patients (>/=18 years) who had a de novo or secondary MDS diagnosis according to French-American-British classification and an International Prognostic Scoring System score >/=0.5 were enrolled and randomized (1:1) to one of two decitabine regimens: 3-day treatment (3-h intravenous infusion of 15 mg/m(2) given every 8 h for three consecutive days/cycle/6 weeks) or 5-day treatment (1-h intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m(2) once daily on days 1-5/cycle/4 weeks). After a minimum of 30 patients were assigned to 3-day schedule, the remaining were assigned to the 5-day schedule. The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary outcome measures included hematologic improvement (HI), cytogenetic response rate, the time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In total, 132 of 135 enrolled patients (3-day treatment, n = 36; 5-day treatment, n = 99) discontinued treatment (major reasons included patient withdrawal/lack of efficacy, n = 48; adverse events, n = 23; and disease progression, n = 22). During the study, 35 of 132 (26.5%) patients from the intent-to-treat (ITT) group achieved significant (P < 0.001) ORR [3-day group (n = 10, 29.4%), P = 0.003; 5-day group (n = 25, 25.5%), P < 0.001]. The HI rate was similar between the 3-day (47.1%) and 5-day groups (48.0%). Cytogenetic response was achieved in 20 of the 30 (66.7%) patients who had a baseline cytogenetic abnormality. Fifty-three (40.2%) AML transformations or deaths occurred and the median AML-free survival time was 23.8 months for all patients from the ITT set; 24-month OS rate was 48.9%. Adverse events of myelosuppression-related disorders (85.6%) and infections (43.2%) were commonly reported. CONCLUSION: Decitabine treatment was efficacious in Chinese patients with MDS with its safety profile comparable to the global studies of decitabine conducted to date.

The goal of this study is estimate the direct cost of illness for AML in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK), by conducting a comprehensive literature review and calculating the average direct cost-of-illness per patient for the first 6 months of therapy. Patients were grouped by therapy: intensive chemotherapy alone; induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT); low intensity therapy; and best supportive care. Data suggest that the pathways alloSCT, followed by intensive chemotherapy, are associated with the highest direct costs. Calculated direct costs suggest that they are higher in the US ($14,014 for BSC-only to $352,682 for alloSCT) than in the UK ( pound3708 [$5837] for BSC-only to pound112,545 [$177,187]).

The DNA methylation regulator TET2 is frequently mutated in AML, and we hypothesized that studying TET2-specific differentially methylated CpGs (tet2-DMCs) improves AML classification. METHODS: We used bisulfite pyrosequencing to analyze the methylation status of four tet2-DMCs (SP140, MCCC1, EHMT1, and MTSS1) in a test group of 94 consecutive patients and a validation group of 92 consecutive patients treated with cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Data were analyzed with hierarchical clustering, Cox proportional hazards regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: In the test cohort, hierarchical clustering analysis identified low levels of tet2-DMC methylation in 31 of 94 (33%) cases, and these had markedly longer overall survival (median survival 72+ vs 14 months, P = .002). Similar results were seen in the validation cohort. tet2-DMC-low status was shown to be an independent predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.29, P = .0002). In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset where DNA methylation was analyzed by a different platform, tet2-DMC-low methylation was also associated with improved outcome (median survival = 55 vs 15 months, P = .0003) and was a better predictor of survival than mutations in TET2, IDH1, or IDH2, individually or combined. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of tet2-DMC methylation define a subgroup of AML that is highly curable and cannot be identified solely by genetic and cytogenetic analyses.","['Yamazaki, Jumpei', 'Taby, Rodolphe', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Raynal, Noel J M', 'Cesaroni, Matteo', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Yamazaki J', 'Taby R', 'Jelinek J', 'Raynal NJ', 'Cesaroni M', 'Pierce SA', 'Kornblau SM', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Issa JP']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA (JY, JJ, NJMR, MC, JPJI);

We performed a Phase II trial to determine rates of complete remission (CR) and survival using tosedostat with cytarabine or decitabine in older patients with untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Thirty-four patients >/=60 years old (median age 70 years; range, 60-83) were randomized to receive tosedostat (120 mg on days 1-21 or 180 mg continuously) with 5 d of either cytarabine (1 g/m2 /d) or decitabine (20 mg/m2 /d) every 35 d. Twenty-nine patients (85%) had AML, including 15 (44%) with secondary AML/MDS, and 5 (15%) had MDS-refractory anaemia with excess blasts type 2. The CR/CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rate was 53% [9 in each arm; 14 CR (41%) and 4 CRi (12%)], attained in 6 of 14 patients with adverse cytogenetics and 4 of 7 with FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations. Median follow-up was 11.2 months (range, 0.5-22.3), and median survival was 11.5 months (95% confidence interval, 5.2-16.7). Twenty-three patients (67.6%) were treated as outpatients and 10 of these patients required hospitalization for febrile neutropenia. No Grade 3-4 non-haematological toxicities required withdrawal from study. Tosedostat with cytarabine or decitabine is tolerated in older patients with untreated AML/MDS, results in a CR/CRi rate of >50%, and warrants further study in larger trials.","['Mawad, Raya', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Hendrie, Paul', 'Scott, Bart', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Dean, Carol', 'Sandhu, Vicky', 'Deeg, Hans Joachim', 'Walter, Roland', 'Wang, Lixia', 'Myint, Han', 'Singer, Jack W', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Pagel, John M']","['Mawad R', 'Becker PS', 'Hendrie P', 'Scott B', 'Wood BL', 'Dean C', 'Sandhu V', 'Deeg HJ', 'Walter R', 'Wang L', 'Myint H', 'Singer JW', 'Estey E', 'Pagel JM']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'CTI Biopharma Corp, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'CTI Biopharma Corp, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'CTI Biopharma Corp, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151116,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'KZK563J2UW (tosedostat)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Glycine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/17 06:00,2016/05/10 06:00,['2015/11/17 06:00'],"['2015/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13829 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jan;172(2):238-45. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13829.

Tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a crucial role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and homeostasis. It has been reported that frequent inactivation of p53 was observed in numerous human cancers including hematologic malignancies. MDM4, the newly discovered modulator of p53 protein, is frequently amplified in various solid tumors such as cutaneous melanoma, retinoblastoma and hematological malignances such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. Multiple evidences implicate that over-expression of MDM4 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis which can be reversed by knockdown of MDM4 expression or restoration of p53 function, and support the rationale for the design of future MDM4-specific therapeutics. This article discusses and focuses on using MDM4 as a novel biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for hematologic malignancies.","['Cao, Lei', 'Fan, Lei', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Cao L', 'Fan L', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China. lijianyonglm@medmail.com.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mdm4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods/trends', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2015/11/17 06:00,2016/09/13 06:00,['2015/11/17 06:00'],"['2015/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['CCDT-EPUB-71695 [pii]', '10.2174/156800961509151110124616 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2015;15(9):769-80. doi: 10.2174/156800961509151110124616.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) promotes proliferation in several cell types. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of HGF gene-transfected MSC (HGF-MSC) in acetaminophen (AAP)-treated hepatocytes. We transfected the HGF gene into MSCs and confirmed HGF expression by RT-PCR and western blot. The concentration of HGF in HGF-MSC conditioned media (HGFCM) was upregulated compared with that in control MSCCM samples. Cell viability was increased in HGFCM-treated hepatocytes. Expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptosis protein, was increased and expression of pro-apoptosis proteins (Bad, Bik and Bid) was decreased in HGFCM-treated hepatocytes. HGF-MSC had protective effects on AAP-induced hepatocyte damage by enhancing proliferation. These results suggest that HGF-expressing MSCs may provide regenerative potential for liver cell damage.","['Jang, Yun Ho', 'You, Dong Hun', 'Nam, Myeong Jin']","['Jang YH', 'You DH', 'Nam MJ']","['a Department of Biological Science , Gachon University , Seongnam , South Korea and.', 'a Department of Biological Science , Gachon University , Seongnam , South Korea and.', 'a Department of Biological Science , Gachon University , Seongnam , South Korea and.', 'b HanCell Inc. , Incheon , South Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151115,England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (HGF protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/biosynthesis', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Liver/injuries', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/biosynthesis']",2015/11/17 06:00,2016/11/12 06:00,['2015/11/17 06:00'],"['2015/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08977194.2015.1080695 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2015;33(5-6):319-25. doi: 10.3109/08977194.2015.1080695.

Higher doses of echinocandins administered intermittently may be an alternative in this setting. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational 5-year study to characterize the safety and efficacy of intermittent administration of high-dose intravenous micafungin (>/=5 doses of >/=300 mg micafungin 2-3 times weekly) in patients with acute leukemia and allogeneic SCT recipients. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (84 allogeneic SCT recipients and 20 patients with leukemia) received intermittent high-dose intravenous micafungin, 83 (79.8%) as prophylaxis. Large variability in the micafungin dosing regimen was observed; 78 (75%) patients received >75% of their course as 300 mg micafungin 3 times weekly. Liver function tests decreased from baseline to end of treatment (EOT; P < .001). Patients with normal baseline liver function (n = 55 [52%]) maintained similar enzyme levels throughout the study. For patients with abnormal baseline liver function (n = 49 [47%]), liver function tests significantly improved from baseline to EOT (P </= .005). Duration and/or micafungin dosing algorithms were not associated with liver toxicity at EOT. There were no significant changes in renal function, and infusion-related reactions or deaths were not observed. Five of 83 (6.0%) patients in the prophylaxis group developed a breakthrough fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest cohort of patients to date, intermittent administration of high-dose micafungin was well tolerated, without any associated liver or renal function abnormalities, and may be considered an alternative antifungal prophylactic strategy. Prospective studies are needed to further validate these findings.","['Neofytos, Dionysis', 'Huang, Yao-Ting', 'Cheng, Kimberly', 'Cohen, Nina', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Barker, Juliet', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Jakubowski, Ann', 'Papanicolaou, Genovefa']","['Neofytos D', 'Huang YT', 'Cheng K', 'Cohen N', 'Perales MA', 'Barker J', 'Giralt S', 'Jakubowski A', 'Papanicolaou G']","['Infectious Diseases Service.', 'Infectious Diseases Service.', 'Infectious Diseases Service.', 'Infectious Diseases Service.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York.', 'Infectious Diseases Service Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Intravenous', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Echinocandins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kidney/physiopathology', '*Leukemia/complications/microbiology', 'Lipopeptides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/15 06:00,2016/08/26 06:00,['2015/11/15 06:00'],"['2015/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['civ818 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/civ818 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2015 Dec 1;61 Suppl 6:S652-61. doi: 10.1093/cid/civ818.,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5006190,,"['(c) The Author 2015.

Multiple signaling pathways function in these processes, but how their spatiotemporal control is established and their activity is coordinated in the context of the entire hematopoietic network are still poorly understood. We report here that loss of the gene Rabex-5 in Drosophila causes several hematopoietic abnormalities, including blood cell (hemocyte) overproliferation, increased size of the hematopoietic organ (the lymph gland), lamellocyte differentiation and melanotic mass formation. Hemocyte-specific Rabex-5 knockdown was sufficient to increase hemocyte populations, increase lymph gland size and induce melanotic masses. Rabex-5 negatively regulates Ras, and we show that Ras activity is responsible for specific Rabex-5 hematopoietic phenotypes. Surprisingly, Ras-independent Notch protein accumulation and transcriptional activity in the lymph gland underlie multiple distinct hematopoietic phenotypes of Rabex-5 loss. Thus, Rabex-5 plays an important role in Drosophila hematopoiesis and might serve as an axis coordinating Ras and Notch signaling in the lymph gland.","['Reimels, Theresa A', 'Pfleger, Cathie M']","['Reimels TA', 'Pfleger CM']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA cathie.pfleger@mssm.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151113,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (N protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Rabex-5 protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Hemocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/11/15 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2015/11/15 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.174433 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.174433 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2015 Dec 15;128(24):4512-25. doi: 10.1242/jcs.174433.

Reports on the frequency of POI after RIC in a large pediatric and adolescent population are lacking. In this study, we describe a girl affected by CML diagnosed at the age of 15 yr and treated with oncarbide and interferon followed by imatinib and dasatinib. She had two pregnancies shortly after RIC performed according to the CML-SCT I-BFM protocol including TT, FLU, and MEL. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism occurred four months after HSCT; menstruations resumed regularly six months after HSCT. Eight and 20 months after HSCT, the patient became pregnant and then delivered, respectively, two babies at term by cesarean section. Both newborns had no neonatal complications. Donor chimerism at time of two pregnancies and five yr after transplantation demonstrated complete donor engraftment. These findings suggest that I-BFM CML-SCT protocol could be a promising treatment option for adolescents or young adults with CML eligible for HSCT.","['Faraci, Maura', 'Matthes-Martin, Susanne', 'Lanino, Edoardo', 'Morreale, Giuseppe', 'Ferretti, Marta', 'Giardino, Stefano', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Balduzzi, Adriana']","['Faraci M', 'Matthes-Martin S', 'Lanino E', 'Morreale G', 'Ferretti M', 'Giardino S', 'Micalizzi C', 'Balduzzi A']","[""Stem Cell Transplantation Unit - Haematology-Oncology Department, G.

The discovery of BRAF(V600E) mutations in approximately 50% of these patients provided the first molecular therapeutic target in histiocytosis. However, recurrent driving mutations in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600E)-wild-type non-LCH are unknown, and recurrent cooperating mutations in non-MAP kinase pathways are undefined for the histiocytic neoplasms. Through combined whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, we identified recurrent kinase fusions involving BRAF, ALK, and NTRK1, as well as recurrent, activating MAP2K1 and ARAF mutations in patients with BRAF(V600E)-wild-type non-LCH. In addition to MAP kinase pathway lesions, recurrently altered genes involving diverse cellular pathways were identified. Treatment of patients with MAP2K1- and ARAF-mutated non-LCH using MEK and RAF inhibitors, respectively, resulted in clinical efficacy, demonstrating the importance of detecting and targeting diverse kinase alterations in these disorders. SIGNIFICANCE: We provide the first description of kinase fusions in systemic histiocytic neoplasms and activating ARAF and MAP2K1 mutations in non-Langerhans histiocytic neoplasms. Refractory patients with MAP2K1- and ARAF-mutant histiocytoses had clinical responses to MEK inhibition and sorafenib, respectively, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genomic analysis of these disorders.","['Diamond, Eli L', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Haroche, Julien', 'Yao, Zhan', 'Ma, Jing', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Wang, Zhaoming', 'Choi, John', 'Kim, Eunhee', 'Cohen-Aubart, Fleur', 'Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei', 'Gao, Yijun', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Campbell, Patrick', 'Walsh, Michael P', 'Sylvester, Brooke', 'Dolgalev, Igor', 'Aminova, Olga', 'Heguy, Adriana', 'Zappile, Paul', 'Nakitandwe, Joy', 'Ganzel, Chezi', 'Dalton, James D', 'Ellison, David W', 'Estrada-Veras, Juvianee', 'Lacouture, Mario', 'Gahl, William A', 'Stephens, Philip J', 'Miller, Vincent A', 'Ross, Jeffrey S', 'Ali, Siraj M', 'Briggs, Samuel R', 'Fasan, Omotayo', 'Block, Jared', 'Heritier, Sebastien', 'Donadieu, Jean', 'Solit, David B', 'Hyman, David M', 'Baselga, Jose', 'Janku, Filip', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Park, Christopher Y', 'Amoura, Zahir', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Emile, Jean-Francois', 'Rosen, Neal', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Diamond EL', 'Durham BH', 'Haroche J', 'Yao Z', 'Ma J', 'Parikh SA', 'Wang Z', 'Choi J', 'Kim E', 'Cohen-Aubart F', 'Lee SC', 'Gao Y', 'Micol JB', 'Campbell P', 'Walsh MP', 'Sylvester B', 'Dolgalev I', 'Aminova O', 'Heguy A', 'Zappile P', 'Nakitandwe J', 'Ganzel C', 'Dalton JD', 'Ellison DW', 'Estrada-Veras J', 'Lacouture M', 'Gahl WA', 'Stephens PJ', 'Miller VA', 'Ross JS', 'Ali SM', 'Briggs SR', 'Fasan O', 'Block J', 'Heritier S', 'Donadieu J', 'Solit DB', 'Hyman DM', 'Baselga J', 'Janku F', 'Taylor BS', 'Park CY', 'Amoura Z', 'Dogan A', 'Emile JF', 'Rosen N', 'Gruber TA', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Internal Medicine Service, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Internal Medicine Service, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Genome Technology Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Genome Technology Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Genome Technology Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Genome Technology Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Dermatology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina.', 'Hematopathology, Carolinas Pathology Group, Charlotte, North Carolina.', 'French Reference Center for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, Trousseau Hospital, Paris, France.

These receptors are known to play important regulatory roles in immune and neuronal functions. Recent studies demonstrated that several of these receptors are expressed by cancer cells. Importantly, they may directly regulate development, drug resistance, and relapse of cancer, and the activity of cancer stem cells. Although counterintuitive, these findings are consistent with the generally immune-suppressive and thus tumor-promoting roles of the inhibitory receptors in the immune system. This review focuses on the ligands, expression pattern, signaling, and function of LILRB family in the context of cancer development. Because inhibition of the signaling of certain LILRBs directly blocks cancer growth and stimulates immunity that may suppress tumorigenesis, but does not disturb normal development, LILRB signaling pathways may represent ideal targets for treating hematological malignancies and perhaps other tumors.","['Zhang, FeiFei', 'Zheng, JunKe', 'Kang, XunLei', 'Deng, Mi', 'Lu, ZhiGang', 'Kim, Jaehyup', 'Zhang, ChengCheng']","['Zhang F', 'Zheng J', 'Kang X', 'Deng M', 'Lu Z', 'Kim J', 'Zhang C']","['Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital; Faculty of Basic Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital; Faculty of Basic Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. zhengjunke@sjtu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. zhengjunke@sjtu.edu.cn.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390, USA.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390, USA.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390, USA.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390, USA.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390, USA.

The drug used alone and in combination with drugs having different mechanisms of action has shown a favorable toxicity profile and significant benefit especially in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients in doses up to 2000 mg. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews pharmacokinetic, clinical application for CLL treatment, and safety profile of ofatumumab as well as differences and similarity between ofatumumab and rituximab. Publications in English from 2010 through October 2015 were surveyed on the MEDLINE database for articles. Proceedings of the American Society of Hematology held during the last 5 years were also included. EXPERT OPINION: Ofatumumab more effectively than rituximab enhanced complement-dependent cytotoxicity playing the crucial role for its therapeutic activity. The drug is highly effective in the first-line and salvage treatment of CLL, essentially as a part of immunochemotherapy, and probably also as maintenance therapy. Its safety profile is very advantageous, since adverse events are usually limited to grade 1 and 2 infusion-related reactions, which tend to decrease throughout the treatment. Its advantage over the other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of CLL remains to be determined in the direct head-to-head trials.","['Korycka-Wolowiec, Anna', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Korycka-Wolowiec A', 'Wolowiec D', 'Robak T']","['a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Ciolkowskiego 2 Str, 93-510 Lodz , Poland.', 'b Department of Hematology , Medical University of Wroclaw , Pasteura 4 Str, 50-367 Wroclaw , Poland.', 'a Department of Hematology , Medical University of Lodz , Ciolkowskiego 2 Str, 93-510 Lodz , Poland.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151113,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rituximab/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy/methods']",2015/11/15 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/11/15 06:00'],"['2015/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2015.1113253 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2015;14(12):1945-59. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2015.1113253.

We investigated widely used, patient-derived myeloid leukemia cell lines with proclivity for differentiation into granulocytes by retinoic acid (RA) and/or monocytes by 1,25-dihyrdroxyvitamin D3 (D3). Using K562 (FAB M1), HL60 (FAB M2), RA-resistant HL60 sublines, NB4 (FAB M3), and U937 (FAB M5), we correlated nuclear transcription factor expression to immunophenotype, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and functional inducible oxidative metabolism. We found that myelomonocytic transcription factors are aberrantly expressed in these cell lines. Monocytic-lineage factor EGR1 was not induced by D3 (the monocytic inducer) but instead by RA (the granulocytic inducer) in lineage bipotent myeloblastic HL60. In promyelocytic NB4 cells, EGR1 levels were increased by D3, while Gfi-1 expression (which promotes the granulocytic lineage) was upregulated during D3-induced monocytic differentiation in HL60, and by RA treatment in monocytic U937 cells. Furthermore, RARalpha and VDR expression were not strongly correlated to differentiation. In response to different differentiation inducers, U937 exhibited the most distinct transcription factor expression profile, while similarly mature NB4 and HL60 were better coupled. Overall, the differentiation induction agents RA and D3 elicited cell-specific responses across these common FAB M1-M5 cell lines.","['Jensen, Holly A', 'Yourish, Harmony B', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Varner, Jeffrey D', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Jensen HA', 'Yourish HB', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Varner JD', 'Yen A']","['School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150928,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,,,,2015/11/14 06:00,2015/11/14 06:01,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.fob.2015.09.008 [doi]', 'S2211-5463(15)00093-5 [pii]']",epublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2015 Sep 28;5:789-800. doi: 10.1016/j.fob.2015.09.008. eCollection 2015.,"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4600856,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'APL, acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'C/EBPalpha, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha', 'CD, cluster of differentiation [marker]', 'D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3', 'Differentiation', 'EGR1, early growth response protein 1', 'FAB, French-American-British [myeloid leukemia classification]', 'Gfi-1, growth factor independent protein 1', 'IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Lineage selection', 'Myeloid leukemia', 'Oct4, octamer-binding transcription factor 4', 'PU.1, binds PU-box, also called Spi-1', 'RA, retinoic acid', 'RARalpha, retinoic acid receptor alpha', 'Retinoic acid', 'VDR, vitamin D receptor', 'Vitamin D3']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Treatment episodes initiating a TKI of interest (index TKI) during June 2008-December 2011 were identified from the IMS PharMetrics Plus Health Plan Claims Database for adult patients with CML diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 205.1x), 120 days pre-index continuous enrollment (CE) and no clinical trial participation. Episodes experiencing treatment failure, defined as switch to a non-index TKI or discontinuation of index TKI (gap of >/= 60 days), and with 1 year CE post-failure, were analyzed. LOT was determined by number of unique TKIs used in the pre-index. All-cause HCRU and costs (2012 USD) in the 1 year post-failure were assessed by LOT, and the comparisons between 1L and 2L failures were also adjusted using multivariate generalized linear models (GLMs) to control for underlying differences. RESULTS: A total of 706 episodes were identified (518 1L; 180 2L; 8 3L). Unadjusted HCRU over 1 year post-failure increased significantly. This was accompanied by a significant increase in unadjusted mean costs for 2L failures vs. 1L failures ($99,624 vs. $78,667, p = 0.021, Delta$20,957). Following the adjustment using GLMs, adjusted mean costs were 38% higher (95% CI 1.14-1.68), driven primarily by use of medical services. In adjusted analyses, compared to 1L, 2L failures had: 45% more ambulatory visits (mean 31 vs. 21, 95% CI 1.26-1.66), 75% higher risk of hospitalization (33% vs. 23% hospitalized, 95% CI 1.16-2.64), and 73% higher medical costs (95% CI 1.31-2.29). Medical costs comprised a greater proportion of total costs in 2L vs. 1L (55% vs. 44%); pharmacy costs did not increase significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden over 1 year post TKI failure increased with each sequential line of TKI treatment failure.","['McGarry, Lisa J', 'Chen, Yaozhu J', 'Divino, Victoria', 'Pokras, Shibani', 'Taylor, Catherine R', 'Munakata, Julie', 'Nieset, Christopher C', 'Huang, Hui', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Malone, Daniel C']","['McGarry LJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Divino V', 'Pokras S', 'Taylor CR', 'Munakata J', 'Nieset CC', 'Huang H', 'Jabbour E', 'Malone DC']","['a a ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'b b IMS Health , Fairfax , VA , USA.', 'b b IMS Health , Fairfax , VA , USA.', 'b b IMS Health , Fairfax , VA , USA.', 'a a ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'b b IMS Health , Fairfax , VA , USA.', 'a a ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'a a ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'c c MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'd d University of Arizona College of Pharmacy , Tucson , AZ , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151130,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Failure']",2015/11/14 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2015.1120189 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2016;32(2):289-99. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2015.1120189.

PML is mainly expressed in the nucleus, where it forms dynamic structures known as PML nuclear bodies that recruit many other proteins, such as Sp100 and Daxx. While the role of PML/TRIM19 in antiviral defense is well documented, its effect on HIV-1 infection remains unclear. Here we show that infection by HIV-1 and other retroviruses triggers the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies, as early as 30 minutes post-infection. Quantification of the number and size of PML cytoplasmic bodies revealed that they last approximately 8 h, with a peak at 2 h post-infection. PML re-localization is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors and is not observed following infection with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription. Furthermore, we show that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection since PML knockdown dramatically increases reverse-transcription efficiency. We demonstrate that PML does not inhibit directly retroviral infection but acts through the stabilization of one of its well-characterized partners, Daxx. In the presence of PML, cytoplasmic Daxx is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription. Interestingly, Daxx not only interferes with exogenous retroviral infections but can also inhibit retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, thus identifying Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription. Altogether, these findings unravel a novel antiviral function for PML and PML nuclear body-associated protein Daxx.","['Dutrieux, Jacques', 'Maarifi, Ghizlane', 'Portilho, Debora M', 'Arhel, Nathalie J', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K', 'Nisole, Sebastien']","['Dutrieux J', 'Maarifi G', 'Portilho DM', 'Arhel NJ', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Nisole S']","['Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'University Institute of Hematology, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'University Institute of Hematology, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151113,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'HIV-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2015/11/14 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1005280 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-15-01451 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2015 Nov 13;11(11):e1005280. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005280. eCollection 2015 Nov.,,PMC4643962,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SF3B1, the most frequently mutated component of the spliceosome in cancer, is involved in the recognition of the branch point sequence (BPS) during selection of the 3' splice site (ss) in RNA splicing. Here, we report that common and tumor-specific splicing aberrations are induced by SF3B1 mutations and establish aberrant 3' ss selection as the most frequent splicing defect. Strikingly, mutant SF3B1 utilizes a BPS that differs from that used by wild-type SF3B1 and requires the canonical 3' ss to enable aberrant splicing during the second step. Approximately 50% of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay resulting in downregulation of gene and protein expression. These findings ascribe functional significance to the consequences of SF3B1 mutations in cancer.","['Darman, Rachel B', 'Seiler, Michael', 'Agrawal, Anant A', 'Lim, Kian H', 'Peng, Shouyong', 'Aird, Daniel', 'Bailey, Suzanna L', 'Bhavsar, Erica B', 'Chan, Betty', 'Colla, Simona', 'Corson, Laura', 'Feala, Jacob', 'Fekkes, Peter', 'Ichikawa, Kana', 'Keaney, Gregg F', 'Lee, Linda', 'Kumar, Pavan', 'Kunii, Kaiko', 'MacKenzie, Crystal', 'Matijevic, Mark', 'Mizui, Yoshiharu', 'Myint, Khin', 'Park, Eun Sun', 'Puyang, Xiaoling', 'Selvaraj, Anand', 'Thomas, Michael P', 'Tsai, Jennifer', 'Wang, John Y', 'Warmuth, Markus', 'Yang, Hui', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Yu, Lihua', 'Smith, Peter G', 'Buonamici, Silvia']","['Darman RB', 'Seiler M', 'Agrawal AA', 'Lim KH', 'Peng S', 'Aird D', 'Bailey SL', 'Bhavsar EB', 'Chan B', 'Colla S', 'Corson L', 'Feala J', 'Fekkes P', 'Ichikawa K', 'Keaney GF', 'Lee L', 'Kumar P', 'Kunii K', 'MacKenzie C', 'Matijevic M', 'Mizui Y', 'Myint K', 'Park ES', 'Puyang X', 'Selvaraj A', 'Thomas MP', 'Tsai J', 'Wang JY', 'Warmuth M', 'Yang H', 'Zhu P', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Furman RR', 'Yu L', 'Smith PG', 'Buonamici S']","['H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10020, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Eisai, Inc., Andover, MA 01810, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Eisai, Inc., Andover, MA 01810, USA.', 'Eisai, Inc., Andover, MA 01810, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Eisai, Inc., Andover, MA 01810, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10020, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

To the authors' knowledge, the impact of specific oncogene rearrangements on outcomes of patients with DHL who are treated with immunochemotherapy has not been previously described. METHODS: The authors identified patients whose diagnostic tissue specimens underwent metaphase karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization for MYC as well as both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements. Cohorts were defined by the presence (+) or absence (-) of rearrangements: MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6- (BCL2-DHL), MYC+/BCL2-/BCL6+ (BCL6-DHL), and MYC+/BCL2+/BCL6+ (triple-hit lymphoma; THL). RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included in the current analysis (76 BCL2-DHL patients, 16 BCL6-DHL patients, and 25 THL patients). Compared with patients with BCL2-DHL, those with BCL6-DHL were more likely to be classified as having a non-germinal center cell of origin, presented with extranodal disease, and appeared to achieve higher rates of complete response despite receiving intensive induction therapy less frequently. However, patients with BCL6-DHL experienced a shorter median overall survival if achieving an initial complete response compared with patients with BCL2-DHL. Patients with THL experienced survival outcomes similar to those of patients with BCL2-DHL. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the specific oncogene rearrangements may be of prognostic value and potentially guide future therapeutic strategies for patients with DHL.","['Landsburg, Daniel J', 'Petrich, Adam M', 'Abramson, Jeremy S', 'Sohani, Aliyah R', 'Press, Oliver', 'Cassaday, Ryan', 'Chavez, Julio C', 'Song, Kevin', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Gandhi, Mitul', 'Shah, Namrata', 'Fenske, Timothy S', 'Jaso, Jesse', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Yang, David T', 'Nabhan, Chadi']","['Landsburg DJ', 'Petrich AM', 'Abramson JS', 'Sohani AR', 'Press O', 'Cassaday R', 'Chavez JC', 'Song K', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Gandhi M', 'Shah N', 'Fenske TS', 'Jaso J', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Yang DT', 'Nabhan C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Robert H.

Despite this, some BCL2(High) cell lines remain resistant to either agent. Here we show that the MCL-1-specific inhibitor A-1210477 sensitizes these cell lines to navitoclax. Chemical segregation of this synergy with the BCL-2-selective inhibitor venetoclax or BCL-XL-selective inhibitor A-1155463 indicated that MCL-1 and BCL-2 are the two key anti-apoptotic targets for sensitization. Similarly, the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol downregulated MCL-1 expression and synergized with venetoclax in BCL2(High) NHL cell lines to a similar extent as A-1210477. A-1210477 also synergized with navitoclax in the majority of BCL2(Low) NHL cell lines. However, chemical segregation with venetoclax or A-1155463 revealed that synergy was driven by BCL-XL inhibition in this population. Collectively these data emphasize that BCL2 status is predictive of venetoclax potency in NHL not only as a single agent, but also in the adjuvant setting with anti-tumorigenic agents that inhibit MCL-1 function. These studies also potentially identify a patient population (BCL2(Low)) that could benefit from BCL-XL (navitoclax)-driven combination therapy.","['Phillips, D C', 'Xiao, Y', 'Lam, L T', 'Litvinovich, E', 'Roberts-Rapp, L', 'Souers, A J', 'Leverson, J D']","['Phillips DC', 'Xiao Y', 'Lam LT', 'Litvinovich E', 'Roberts-Rapp L', 'Souers AJ', 'Leverson JD']","['Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151113,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (A-1210477)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2015/11/14 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201588 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.88 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Nov 13;5:e368. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.88.,,PMC4670945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood Cancer J. 2016;6:e403.

Potentially fatal disease complications in PV and ET include disease transformation into myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The range of reported frequencies for post-PV MF were 4.9-6% at 10 years and 6-14% at 15 years and for post-ET MF were 0.8-4.9% at 10 years and 4-11% at 15 years. The corresponding figures for post-PV AML were 2.3-14.4% at 10 years and 5.5-18.7% at 15 years and for post-ET AML were 0.7-3% at 10 years and 2.1-5.3% at 15 years. Risk factors cited for post-PV MF include advanced age, leukocytosis, reticulin fibrosis, splenomegaly and JAK2V617F allele burden and for post-ET MF include advanced age, leukocytosis, anemia, reticulin fibrosis, absence of JAK2V617F, use of anagrelide and presence of ASXL1 mutation. Risk factors for post-PV AML include advanced age, leukocytosis, reticulin fibrosis, splenomegaly, abnormal karyotype, TP53 or RUNX1 mutations as well as use of pipobroman, radiophosphorus (P(32)) and busulfan and for post-ET AML include advanced age, leukocytosis, anemia, extreme thrombocytosis, thrombosis, reticulin fibrosis, TP53 or RUNX1 mutations. It is important to note that some of the aforementioned incidence figures and risk factor determinations are probably inaccurate and at times conflicting because of the retrospective nature of studies and the inadvertent labeling, in some studies, of patients with prefibrotic primary MF or 'masked' PV, as ET. Ultimately, transformation of MPN leads to poor outcomes and management remains challenging. Further understanding of the molecular events leading to disease transformation is being investigated.","['Cerquozzi, S', 'Tefferi, A']","['Cerquozzi S', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151113,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/epidemiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*epidemiology/pathology']",2015/11/14 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201595 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.95 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Nov 13;5:e366. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.95.,,PMC4670948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the recently proposed anti-bcl-2 molecules, such as ABT-199, have emphasized the potential role of of bcl-2 family proteins in the context of target therapies. We investigated bax/bcl-2 ratio by flow cytometry in 502 patients and identified a cut off of 1.50 to correlate bax/bcl-2 ratio with well-established clinical and biological prognosticators. Bax/bcl-2 was 1.50 or over in 263 patients (52%) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Higher bax/bcl-2 was associated with low Rai stage, lymphocyte doubling time over 12 months, beta-2 microglobulin less than 2.2 mg/dL, soluble CD23 less than 70 U/mL and a low risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.0001). On the other hand, lower bax/bcl-2 was correlated with unmutated IGHV (P<0.0001), mutated NOTCH1 (P<0.0001) and mutated TP53 (P=0.00007). Significant shorter progression-free survival and overall survival were observed in patients with lower bax/bcl-2 (P<0.0001). Moreover, within IGHV unmutated (168 patients) and TP53 mutated (37 patients) subgroups, higher bax/bcl-2 identified cases with significant longer PFS (P=0.00002 and P=0.039). In multivariate analysis of progression-free survival and overall survival, bax/bcl-2 was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.0002 and P=0.002). In conclusion, we defined the prognostic power of bax/bcl-2 ratio, as determined by a flow cytometric approach, and highlighted a correlation with chemoresistance and outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Finally, the recently proposed new therapies employing bcl-2 inhibitors prompted the potential use of bax/bcl-2 ratio to identify patients putatively resistant to these molecules.","['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'Bittolo, Tamara', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Cefalo, Mariagiovanna', 'De Santis, Giovanna', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni']","['Del Principe MI', 'Dal Bo M', 'Bittolo T', 'Buccisano F', 'Rossi FM', 'Zucchetto A', 'Rossi D', 'Bomben R', 'Maurillo L', 'Cefalo M', 'De Santis G', 'Venditti A', 'Gaidano G', 'Amadori S', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Gattei V', 'Del Poeta G']","['Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, S.

We hypothesized that the use of bone marrow graft might decrease the risk of graft-versus-host disease compared to peripheral blood after reduced intensity conditioning regimens without compromising graft-versus-leukemia effects. Patients who underwent reduced intensity conditioning regimen allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from 2000 to 2012 for acute leukemia, and who were reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were included in the study. Eight hundred and thirty-seven patients receiving bone marrow grafts were compared with 9011 peripheral blood transplant recipients after reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Median follow up of surviving patients was 27 months. Cumulative incidence of engraftment (neutrophil >/=0.5x10(9)/L at day 60) was lower in bone marrow recipients: 88% versus 95% (P<0.0001). Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was lower in bone marrow recipients: 19% versus 24% for peripheral blood (P=0.005). In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for differences between both groups, overall survival [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.90; P=0.05] and leukemia-free survival (HR 0.88; P=0.01) were higher in patients transplanted with peripheral blood compared to bone marrow grafts. Furthermore, peripheral blood graft was also associated with decreased risk of relapse (HR 0.78; P=0.0001). There was no significant difference in non-relapse mortality between recipients of bone marrow and peripheral blood grafts, and chronic graft-versus-host disease was significantly higher after peripheral blood grafts (HR 1.38; P<0.0001). Despite the limitation of a retrospective registry-based study, we found that peripheral blood grafts after reduced intensity conditioning regimens had better overall and leukemia-free survival than bone marrow grafts. However, there is an increase in chronic graft-versus-host disease after peripheral blood grafts. Long-term follow up is needed to clarify whether chronic graft-versus-host disease might increase the risk of late morbidity and mortality.","['Savani, Bipin N', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Vigouroux, Stephane', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Gorin, Norbert C', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Savani BN', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Niederwieser D', 'Ciceri F', 'Ganser A', 'Arnold R', 'Afanasyev B', 'Vigouroux S', 'Milpied N', 'Hallek M', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Polge E', 'Baron F', 'Esteve J', 'Gorin NC', 'Schmid C', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA Bipin.Savani@Vanderbilt.Edu.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie - Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille - Aix-Marseille University, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."", 'University Hospital Leipzig, Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology Divisions, Germany.', 'Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hannover Medical School - Department of Haematology Hemostasis Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum - Medizinische Klinik m.

In this study, pharmacological effects of cryptotanshinone on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were investigated. IC50 values of 5.0 and 4.8 were obtained in CEM/ADR5000 and CCRF-CEM. Microarray-based mRNA expression revealed that cryptotanshinone regulated genes associated with cell cycle, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), NFkappaB signaling and cellular movement. The involvement of these pathways in the mode of action of cryptotanshinone was subsequently validated by additional independent in vitro studies. Cryptotanshinone stimulated ROS generation and induced DNA damage. It arrested cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis as measured by annexin V-FITC-conjugating fluorescence. The induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by cryptotanshinone was proved by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cleavage of caspase 3/7, caspase 9 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). DNA-binding motif analysis of the microarray-retrieved deregulated genes in the promoter region revealed NFkappaB as potential transcription factor involved in cryptotanshinone's mode of action. Molecular docking and Western blotting provided supportive evidence, suggesting that cryptotanshinone binds to IKK-beta and inhibits the translocation of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus. In addition, cryptotanshinone inhibited cellular movement as shown by a fibronectin-based cellular adhesion assay, indicating that this compound exerts anti-invasive features. In conclusion, cryptotanshinone exerts profound cytotoxicity, which is caused by multispecific modes of actions, including G2/M arrest, apoptosis and inhibition of cellular movement. The inhibitory activities of this compound may be explained by inhibition of NFkappaB, which orchestrates all these mechanisms.","['Wu, Ching-Fen', 'Klauck, Sabine M', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Wu CF', 'Klauck SM', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genome Analysis, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany. efferth@uni-mainz.de.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151113,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5E9SXT166N (cryptotanshinone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2015/11/14 06:00,2017/03/10 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00204-015-1616-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-015-1616-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2016 Sep;90(9):2275-2286. doi: 10.1007/s00204-015-1616-4.

It functions as both a transactivator and genetic suppressor, acting both directly, binding to promoter regions, and indirectly, binding to promoter-bound transcription factors. It has essential roles in the differentiation and growth of various cells in the central nervous system, immune system, integumentary system and cardiovascular system, to the extent that Bcl11b knockout mice are incompatible with extra-uterine life.

The patients with this translocation although have a favourable prognosis, but the 5-year survival is only about 50%. It is anticipated that identification of novel therapeutic targets in t(8;21) positive AML will lead to treatment options that improve patient survival. AREAS COVERED: The oncoprotein and the proteins required to maintain its stability and functionality are the first obvious therapeutic targets. Further, newer technologies like combining gene expression and DNA occupancy profiling assays, gene expression-based high-throughput screening, etc have led to identification of proteins or pathways that are required by AML1-ETO for leukemogenesis and the agents that modulate these proteins to be considered good candidates for targeted molecular therapy. Various FDA approved drugs and secondary metabolites derived from traditional medicinal plants have been shown to possess anti-proliferative effect on t(8:21) harboring leukemic cell lines. CONCLUSION: In order to improve the therapeutic regime for AML patients with t(8;21), efforts are required to translate the success achieved in identification of potent candidates for targeted therapy into clinical setup in the best possible combination.","['Arora, Rashi', 'Sawney, Sharad', 'Saluja, Daman']","['Arora R', 'Sawney S', 'Saluja D']","['Dr. B.R.

Loss of IRF8 in mice leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, indicating a tumor-suppressive role of IRF8. The Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) protein represses the IRF8-promoter. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 can act as a transcriptional co-factor of WT1 and potentiate the cytotoxic response to the cytostatic drug cytarabine. We hypothesized that cytarabine upregulates IRF8 and that transcriptional control of IRF8 involves WT1 and ZNF224. Treatment of leukemic K562 cells with cytarabine upregulated IRF8 protein and mRNA, which was correlated to increased expression of ZNF224. Knock down of ZNF224 with shRNA suppressed both basal and cytarabine-induced IRF8 expression. While ZNF224 alone did not affect IRF8 promoter activity, ZNF224 partially reversed the suppressive effect of WT1 on the IRF8 promoter, as judged by luciferase reporter experiments. Coprecipitation revealed nuclear binding of WT1 and ZNF224, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments it was demonstrated that WT1 recruits ZNF224 to the IRF8 promoter. We conclude that cytarabine-induced upregulation of the IRF8 in leukemic cells involves increased levels of ZNF224, which can counteract the repressive activity of WT1 on the IRF8-promoter.","['Montano, Giorgia', 'Ullmark, Tove', 'Jernmark-Nilsson, Helena', 'Sodaro, Gaetano', 'Drott, Kristina', 'Costanzo, Paola', 'Vidovic, Karina', 'Gullberg, Urban']","['Montano G', 'Ullmark T', 'Jernmark-Nilsson H', 'Sodaro G', 'Drott K', 'Costanzo P', 'Vidovic K', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Medical Faculty, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden.

This oncogene is known to deregulate different downstream pathways which ultimately lead to cell proliferation, defective DNA repair, and inhibition of apoptosis. Fas (Fas cell surface death receptor) is a member of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily which interacts with its ligand, FasL, to initiate apoptosis. Promoter polymorphisms in Fas-FasL genes are known to influence the apoptotic signaling. Hence, the present study has been aimed to find out the association of the promoter polymorphisms in Fas and FasL genes with the development and progression of CML. Blood samples from 772 subjects (386 controls and 386 cases) were collected and genotyped for Fas-FasL gene polymorphisms through PCR-RFLP method. The association between SNPs and clinical outcome was analyzed using statistical softwares like SPSS version 20, SNPSTATs, and Haploview 2.1. The study revealed a significant association of Fas -670 G>A and FasL -844 T>C polymorphisms with the development of CML while Fas -670 AG was associated with accelerated phase. Combined risk analysis by taking the risk genotypes in cases and controls revealed a significant increase in CML risk with increase in number of risk genotypes (one risk genotype-OR 1.99 (1.44-2.76), p < 0.0001; two risk genotypes-OR 3.33 (1.91-5.81), p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Fas -670 A>G and FasL -844 T>C showed reduced event-free survival in patients carrying the variant genotypes, Fas -670 GG, 32.363 +/- 6.33, and FasL -844 CC, 33.489 +/- 5.83, respectively. Our findings revealed a significant association of Fas -670 GG, FasL -844 TC, and CC genotypes with increased risk of CML.","['Edathara, Prajitha Mohandas', 'Gorre, Manjula', 'Kagita, Sailaja', 'Vuree, Sugunakar', 'Cingeetham, Anuradha', 'Nanchari, Santhoshi Rani', 'Meka, Phanni Bhushann', 'Annamaneni, Sandhya', 'Digumarthi, Raghunadha Rao', 'Satti, Vishnupriya']","['Edathara PM', 'Gorre M', 'Kagita S', 'Vuree S', 'Cingeetham A', 'Nanchari SR', 'Meka PB', 'Annamaneni S', 'Digumarthi RR', 'Satti V']","['Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Visakhapatnam, 530053, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Visakhapatnam, 530053, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India. sattivishnupriya@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151113,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'fas Receptor/*genetics']",2015/11/14 06:00,2017/02/02 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4295-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4295-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Apr;37(4):5475-84. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4295-0.

Ex vivo experiments showed that the lymphocytes from the Mlf1-deficient mice were more resistant to apoptotic stimulations than the wild-type cells. Furthermore, the ectopically expressed MLF1 induced apoptosis in the cell models. These findings revealed that MLF1 was required for the cells to respond to the apoptotic stimulations. Ex vivo experiments also demonstrated that cytokine withdrawal significantly up-regulated Mlf1's expression and promoted its association with B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) in the lymphocytes, at the same time reduced the association of Bax with Bcl-XL The same effects were also observed in the cells that over-expressed MLF1. However, these effects were observed in Mlf1 null lymphocytes as well as the cells over-expressing Bcl-XL. In addition, MLF1's proapoptosis could be completely prevented by co-expression of Bcl-XL and significantly attenuated in Bax/Bak double null cells. These data, taken together, strongly suggested that in response to the stresses, up-regulated Mlf1 promoted its association with Bcl-XL and reduced the available Bcl-XL for associating with Bax, which resulted in releasing Bax from the Bcl-XL and apoptosis in turn. Lastly, we showed that MLF1 was negatively regulated by 14-3-3 and revealed that 14-3-3 bound to MLF1 and physically blocked MLF1's Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) as well as Bcl-XL from associating with MLF1. Our findings suggested that ectopically expressed MLF1 could be responsible for the pathological apoptosis in early myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.","['Sun, Yi', 'Fu, Amina', 'Xu, Wu', 'Chao, Jyh-Rong', 'Moshiach, Simon', 'Morris, Stephan W']","['Sun Y', 'Fu A', 'Xu W', 'Chao JR', 'Moshiach S', 'Morris SW']","[""Department of Hematology, Shijiazhuang City First Hospital, 36 FanXiLu, Shijiazhuang, 050011, People's Republic of China. yisun456@yahoo.com."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. yisun456@yahoo.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Shijiazhuang City First Hospital, 36 FanXiLu, Shijiazhuang, 050011, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Chemistry, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, 70504, USA.', ""Department of Biochemistry, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Genetics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151112,Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mlf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Thymocytes/physiology/radiation effects', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2015/11/14 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13105-015-0445-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13105-015-0445-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2015 Dec;71(4):807-21. doi: 10.1007/s13105-015-0445-5.

Currently, therapies capable of providing durable remissions in relapsed/refractory TP53- or ATM-defective CLL are lacking. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) mediates response to replication stress, the absence of which leads to collapse of stalled replication forks into chromatid fragments that require resolution through the ATM/p53 pathway. Here, using AZD6738, a novel ATR kinase inhibitor, we investigated ATR inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy to target CLL cells with TP53 or ATM defects. Irrespective of TP53 or ATM status, induction of CLL cell proliferation upregulated ATR protein, which then became activated in response to replication stress. In TP53- or ATM-defective CLL cells, inhibition of ATR signaling by AZD6738 led to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, which was carried through into mitosis because of defective cell cycle checkpoints, resulting in cell death by mitotic catastrophe. Consequently, AZD6738 was selectively cytotoxic to both TP53- and ATM-defective CLL cell lines and primary cells. This was confirmed in vivo using primary xenograft models of TP53- or ATM-defective CLL, where treatment with AZD6738 resulted in decreased tumor load and reduction in the proportion of CLL cells with such defects. Moreover, AZD6738 sensitized TP53- or ATM-defective primary CLL cells to chemotherapy and ibrutinib. Our findings suggest that ATR is a promising therapeutic target for TP53- or ATM-defective CLL that warrants clinical investigation.","['Kwok, Marwan', 'Davies, Nicholas', 'Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Smith, Edward', 'Oldreive, Ceri', 'Petermann, Eva', 'Stewart, Grant', 'Brown, Jeff', 'Lau, Alan', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Parry, Helen', 'Taylor, Malcolm', 'Moss, Paul', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Kwok M', 'Davies N', 'Agathanggelou A', 'Smith E', 'Oldreive C', 'Petermann E', 'Stewart G', 'Brown J', 'Lau A', 'Pratt G', 'Parry H', 'Taylor M', 'Moss P', 'Hillmen P', 'Stankovic T']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'Oncology iMed, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA;', 'R&D Oncology iMed, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Alderley Park, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom; and.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom;']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151112,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2015/11/14 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/11/14 06:00'],"['2015/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30495-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-05-644872 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Feb 4;127(5):582-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-05-644872.

Based on temporal trends during 1978-2007 in 24 populations, lymphoid leukemia and myeloid leukemia incidence rates generally have not changed greatly and differences in rates for non-Hodgkin and for Hodgkin lymphoma have diminished in some regions. Lymphoid leukemia rates during 2003-2007 in 54 populations varied about 10-fold, with rates highest in US white Hispanics (50.2 per million person-years) and Ecuador (48.3) and lowest in US blacks (20.4), Tunisia (17.7) and Uganda (6.9). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma rates varied 30-fold, with very high rates in sub-Saharan Africa (146.0 in Malawi and 54.3 in Uganda) and low rates (</= 10) in some Asian populations (China, Japan, India, the Philippines and Thailand) and U.S. Asian-Pacific Islanders, eastern and northern European populations and Puerto Rico. Hodgkin lymphoma rates varied 15-fold, with rates highest in Italy (21.3) and lowest in China (1.7). Myeloid leukemia rates varied only about fivefold, with rates highest in the Philippines and Korea (exceeding 14.0) and lowest in Eastern Europe (5.9 in Serbia and 5.3 in the Czech Republic) and Uganda (2.7). The boy/girl average incidence rate ratios were 2.00 or lower. Age-specific patterns differed among the four hematopoietic malignancies, but were generally consistent within major categories world-wide, except for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A systematic world-wide approach comparing postulated etiologic factors in low- versus high-risk populations may help clarify the etiology of these childhood malignancies.","['Linet, Martha S', 'Brown, Linda M', 'Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Check, David', 'Ostroumova, Evgenia', 'Landgren, Annelie', 'Devesa, Susan S']","['Linet MS', 'Brown LM', 'Mbulaiteye SM', 'Check D', 'Ostroumova E', 'Landgren A', 'Devesa SS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778 USA.', 'RTI International, Rockville, MD.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778 USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778 USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778 USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778 USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778 USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20151221,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Global Health/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29924 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Apr 15;138(8):1862-74. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29924.

Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) occasionally is used to stop bleeding in a variety of off-label indications, with the main argument curtailing its use being thrombotic events. The authors describe the use of rFVIIa for bleeding after full-mouth extraction in a patient with undiagnosed B-cell lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old man underwent full-mouth extraction (18 teeth). The next day, the patient experienced massive oral bleeding. The authors administered tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, and a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells in addition to local hemostatic measures without control of bleeding. On postoperative day 10, the authors administered 5,000 micrograms of rFVIIa, and within 2 hours oral the bleeding ceased. The authors performed flow cytometry and diagnosed B-cell lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Unexplained massive oral bleeding despite adequate local hemostatic measures should prompt further investigations for underlying bleeding or coagulation disorders. The authors describe the successful use of rFVIIa in massive oral bleeding. Further studies are mandatory to study the effectiveness of this drug for this off-label indication.","['Sprenker, Collin', 'Omar, Hesham R', 'Powless, R Andrew', 'Mangar, Devanand', 'Camporesi, Enrico']","['Sprenker C', 'Omar HR', 'Powless RA', 'Mangar D', 'Camporesi E']",,,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20151106,England,J Am Dent Assoc,Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),7503060,"['0 (Coagulants)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Coagulants/*therapeutic use', 'Factor VIIa/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Oral Hemorrhage/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Tooth Extraction/*adverse effects']",2015/11/13 06:00,2017/02/23 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-8177(15)00899-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.adaj.2015.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Dent Assoc. 2016 Feb;147(2):142-5. doi: 10.1016/j.adaj.2015.09.001.

PURPOSE: This study was designed to help explain how the meaning of disease and spiritual responses to threatening stressors influence the final experiential outcomes of adults with leukemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Iran. METHODS: This grounded theory study conducted in-depth interviews between 2009 and 2011 on 10 adults in Iran with leukemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recorded audio interviews were transcribed verbatim in Persian and coded and analyzed using Corbin and Strauss (2008)'s approach. RESULTS: Main categories that emerged from data included ""experiencing the meaning of cancer""; ""changing perceptions of death, life and health""; and ""moving toward perfection and sublimity."" ""Finding meaning"" was the main concept that defined the final outcome of the experience of participants. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding the meaning to patients of disease and treatments may help healthcare providers better appreciate the patients' perspective and improve the physician-patient relationship. Nurses are well positioned to play a decisive role in helping patients cope effectively with their treatment process and in helping ensure positive outcomes for treatments through their helping patients find the unique meaning of their experience.","['Farsi, Zahra']",['Farsi Z'],"['PhD, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Nursing, Medical Surgical Department, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China (Republic : 1949- ),J Nurs Res,The journal of nursing research : JNR,101128757,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Grounded Theory', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*nursing/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Spirituality', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/09/28 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JNR.0000000000000088 [doi]', '00134372-201512000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nurs Res. 2015 Dec;23(4):290-7. doi: 10.1097/JNR.0000000000000088.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the resistance to imatinib caused by the gatekeeper mutation T315I in Bcr-Abl remains a challenge in the clinic. Inspired by the successful development of ponatinib to curb drug resistance, we hypothesize that the incorporation of an alkyne linker in other heterocyclic scaffolds can also achieve potent inhibition of Bcr-Abl(T315I) by allowing for simultaneous occupancy of both the active site and the allosteric pocket in the Abl kinase domain. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of a series of alkyne-containing pyrazolopyrimidines as Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that some alkyne-containing pyrazolopyrimidines potently inhibit not only Abl(T315I) in vitro but also Bcr-Abl(T315I) in cells. These pyrazolopyrimidines can serve as lead compounds for future development of novel targeted therapy to overcome drug resistance of CML.","['Liu, Xu', 'Kung, Alvin', 'Malinoski, Brock', 'Prakash, G K Surya', 'Zhang, Chao']","['Liu X', 'Kung A', 'Malinoski B', 'Prakash GK', 'Zhang C']","['Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute & Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.', 'Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute & Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.', 'Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute & Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.', 'Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute & Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.', 'Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute & Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.', 'USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151120,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Alkynes/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2015 Dec 10;58(23):9228-37. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01125.

ROR1 is considered an onco-fetal antigen. In the present study we analysed spontaneous humoral and cellular immunity against ROR1 in CLL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibodies against ROR1 were analysed in 23 patients and 20 healthy donors by ELISA and Western blot. Purified serum IgG from patients was tested for cytotoxicity against CLL cells using the MTT viability assay. A cellular immune response against ROR1 derived HLA-A2 restricted 9 aa and 16 aa long peptides were analysed using peptide loaded dendritic cells co-cultured with autologous T cells from CLL patients (n = 9) and healthy donors (n = 6). IFN-gamma, IL-5 and IL-17A-secreting T cells were assessed by ELISPOT and a proliferative response using a H3-thymidine incorporation assay. RESULTS: The majority of CLL patients had antibodies against ROR1. Significantly higher titers of anti-ROR1 antibodies were noted in patients with non-progressive as compared to progressive disease. The extracellular membrane-close ROR1 KNG domain seemed to be an immunodominant epitope. Ten patients with high titers of anti-ROR1 binding antibodies were tested for cytotoxicity. Five of those had cytotoxic anti-ROR1 antibodies against CLL cells. ROR1-specific IFN-gamma and IL-17A producing T cells could be detected in CLL patients, preferentially in non-progressive as compared to patients with progressive disease (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: ROR1 seemed to spontaneously induce a humoral as well as a T cell response in CLL patients.

These non-heterocystous filamentous diazotrophs employ a potentially unique strategy of near-concurrent nitrogen fixation and oxygenic photosynthesis, potentially burdening Trichodesmium with a particularly high iron requirement due to the iron-binding proteins involved in these processes. Iron availability may therefore have a significant influence on the biogeography of Trichodesmium. Previous investigations of molecular responses to iron stress in this keystone marine microbe have largely been targeted. Here a holistic approach was taken using a label-free quantitative proteomics technique (MSE) to reveal a sophisticated multi-faceted proteomic response of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 to iron stress. Increased abundances of proteins known to be involved in acclimation to iron stress and proteins known or predicted to be involved in iron uptake were observed, alongside decreases in the abundances of iron-binding proteins involved in photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. Preferential loss of proteins with a high iron content contributed to overall reductions of 55-60% in estimated proteomic iron requirements. Changes in the abundances of iron-binding proteins also suggested the potential importance of alternate photosynthetic pathways as Trichodesmium reallocates the limiting resource under iron stress. Trichodesmium therefore displays a significant and integrated proteomic response to iron availability that likely contributes to the ecological success of this species in the ocean.","['Snow, Joseph T', 'Polyviou, Despo', 'Skipp, Paul', 'Chrismas, Nathan A M', 'Hitchcock, Andrew', 'Geider, Richard', 'Moore, C Mark', 'Bibby, Thomas S']","['Snow JT', 'Polyviou D', 'Skipp P', 'Chrismas NA', 'Hitchcock A', 'Geider R', 'Moore CM', 'Bibby TS']","['Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Proteomic Research, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, University Road, Clifton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Firth Court, Western Bank, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom.', 'Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151112,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cyanobacteria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Stress, Physiological']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0142626 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-23735 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 12;10(11):e0142626. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142626. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4642986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal WNT signaling has been related to the development of leukemogenic processes. In this regard, it is important to know the expression profile of WNT receptors in normal and malignant cells, in order to understand the WNT mechanisms that control the cell behavior. This work aimed to determine the WNT receptors expression profile in normal and leukemia cells. METHODS: Expression of WNT receptors was determined by flow cytometry using leukemia-derived cell lines, peripheral blood cells, and blood marrow samples from healthy volunteers and acute leukemia patients. RESULTS: Despite the heterogenic WNT receptors expression in mature normal blood cells and in immature tumorigenic cells, the RYK receptor was found highly express in leukemia cells, but not in normal cells. RYK expression was found mainly in cells positive to immature markers like CD33, CD13, CD7, and CD117. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show differences in FZD receptors expression between T and B leukemic cells, but both cell types and also myeloblast-derived cells express high levels of RYK. The association of RYK expression with immature markers indicates its possible use as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target.","['Alvarez-Zavala, Monserrat', 'Riveros-Magana, Alma R', 'Garcia-Castro, Beatriz', 'Barrera-Chairez, Esperanza', 'Rubio-Jurado, Benjamin', 'Garces-Ruiz, Oscar M', 'Ramos-Solano, Moises', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F']","['Alvarez-Zavala M', 'Riveros-Magana AR', 'Garcia-Castro B', 'Barrera-Chairez E', 'Rubio-Jurado B', 'Garces-Ruiz OM', 'Ramos-Solano M', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A', 'Jave-Suarez LF']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biomedicas, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS), Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Investigacion Clinica, CUCS, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Sinaloa, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia UMAE, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional de Occidente (CMNO)-IMSS, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia UMAE, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional de Occidente (CMNO)-IMSS, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151130,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Wnt)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Wnt/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/13 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12698 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Aug;97(2):155-65. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12698.

After a detailed statistical analysis, the resulting correlation coefficient (degree of matching of proposed framework with real data) is 0.9816 +/- 0.009 at 95% confidence interval.

Menin is primarily nuclear protein, acting as a tumor suppressor in endocrine organs, but as an oncogenic factor in the mixed lineage leukemia, in a tissue-specific manner. Recently, the crystal structures of menin with different binding partners reveal menin as a key scaffold protein that functionally interacts with various partners to regulate gene transcription in the nucleus. However, outside the nucleus, menin also regulates multiple signaling pathways that traverse the cell surface membrane. The precise nature regarding to how menin associates with the membrane fraction is poorly understood. Here we show that a small fraction of menin associates with the cell membrane fraction likely via serine palmitoylation. Moreover, the majority of the membrane-associated menin may reside inside membrane vesicles, as menin is protected from trypsin-mediated proteolysis, but disruption of the membrane fraction using detergent abolishes the detection. Consistently, cellular staining for menin also reveals the distribution of menin in the cell membrane and the punctate-like cell organelles. Our findings suggest that part of intracellular menin associates with the cell membrane peripherally as well as resides within the membrane vesicles.","['He, Xin', 'Wang, Lei', 'Yan, Jizhou', 'Yuan, Chaoxing', 'Witze, Eric S', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['He X', 'Wang L', 'Yan J', 'Yuan C', 'Witze ES', 'Hua X']","['a Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine , 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA.', 'a Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine , 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA.', 'd Department of Urology , Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University , Wuhan 430060 , Hubei , China.', 'b Department of Biology and Biotechnology , Shanghai Ocean University , 999 Hucheng Ring Rd Lingang New City, Shanghai , 201306 , China.', 'c The Proteomics and Systems Facility, Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine , Philadelphia, 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA.', 'a Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine , 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA.', 'a Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine , 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Lipoylation', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1108497 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016;17(1):114-22. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1108497.,"['1-R01-CA-178856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK097555/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK050306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4847924,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell membrane', 'menin', 'palmitoylation', 'secretory pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical use of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is limited by its cardiotoxic side effects. Grape seed and skin extract (GSSE) is a polyphenolic mixture with antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of GSSE on arsenic-induced cardiac oxidative stress and injury. Animals exposed to 2.5 mg/kg As2O3 for 21 days exhibited a relevant increase in heart lipoperoxidation, protein carbonylation, and inflammation, as well as a drop in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).

T cells engineered to express these artificial receptors hold great promise, but also carry significant risk. While permanent genetic modification of mature T cells appears safe, modulating their in vivo function is difficult, partly because the robust response can trigger other arms of the immune system. Suicide systems and toxicity management with cytokine blockade or signal transduction modulators have emerged as a new frontier in this field, a far cry from early problems getting CAR T cells to work at all. Currently, clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies treated with CD19-specific CAR T cells have induced durable remissions in adults and children. Results from these trials indicate that more work needs to be done to understand biomarkers of efficacy, the role of T cell persistence and how to integrate this care into standard practice.

CD49d expression was stable over the course of the disease. A high expression of CD49d (>30%) was found in 142/415 (34%) patients and was associated with progressive disease (advanced clinical stage, high serum lactate dehydrogenase or beta2 -microglobulin levels; all p < 0.05) and aggressive disease biology (increased ZAP70 or CD38, unmutated IGHV, trisomy 12, mutations of NOTCH1 and SF3B1; all P < 0.05). A higher CD49d expression was also associated with a lower blood lymphocyte count and a higher number of lymphoid areas involved by the disease. Patients with high CD49d expression were treated more frequently (55% vs. 27%; P < 0.001) and earlier (median time to treatment [TTT] 65.4 months vs. not reached; P < 0.001) than those with low CD49d expression. However, no significant differences in response rates were observed. In the subgroup of patients with mutated IGHV, high CD49d expression was predictive of a shorter TTT while other markers, such as ZAP70 and CD38, were not. In conclusion, in this study CD49d expression correlated with high-risk CLL biomarkers and proved to be useful for separating patients with mutated IGHV into two different prognostic groups.","['Baumann, Tycho', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Santacruz, Rodrigo', 'Martinez-Trillos, Alejandra', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Lopez, Cristina', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Carrio, Anna', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Baumann T', 'Delgado J', 'Santacruz R', 'Martinez-Trillos A', 'Rozman M', 'Aymerich M', 'Lopez C', 'Costa D', 'Carrio A', 'Villamor N', 'Montserrat E']","[""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute for Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Haematopathology Unit, Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151112,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Integrin alpha4/*blood', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13788 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jan;172(1):48-55. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13788.

The antiviral function of ND10 is antagonized by viral regulatory proteins such as the immediate early protein IE1 of HCMV. IE1 interacts with PML through its globular core domain (IE1CORE) and induces ND10 disruption in order to initiate lytic HCMV infection. Here, we investigate the consequences of a point mutation (L174P) in IE1CORE, which was shown to abrogate the interaction with PML, for lytic HCMV infection. We found that a recombinant HCMV encoding IE1-L174P displays a severe growth defect similar to that of an IE1 deletion virus. Bioinformatic modeling based on the crystal structure of IE1CORE suggested that insertion of proline into the highly alpha-helical domain severely affects its structural integrity. Consistently, L174P mutation abrogates the functionality of IE1CORE and results in degradation of the IE1 protein during infection. In addition, our data provide evidence that IE1CORE as expressed by a recombinant HCMV encoding IE1 1-382 not only is required to antagonize PML-mediated intrinsic immunity but also affects a recently described function of PML in innate immune signaling. We demonstrate a coregulatory role of PML in type I and type II interferon-induced gene expression and provide evidence that upregulation of interferon-induced genes is inhibited by IE1CORE. In conclusion, our data suggest that targeting PML by viral regulatory proteins represents a strategy to antagonize both intrinsic and innate immune mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which represent nuclear multiprotein complexes consisting of PML and additional proteins, represent important cellular structures that mediate intrinsic resistance against many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). During HCMV infection, the major immediate early protein IE1 binds to PML via a central globular domain (IE1CORE), and we have shown previously that this is sufficient to antagonize intrinsic immunity. Here, we demonstrate that modification of PML by IE1CORE not only abrogates intrinsic defense mechanisms but also attenuates the interferon response during infection. Our data show that PML plays a novel coregulatory role in type I as well as type II interferon-induced gene expression, which is antagonized by IE1CORE. Importantly, our finding supports the view that targeting of PML-NBs by viral regulatory proteins has evolved as a strategy to inhibit both intrinsic and innate immune defense mechanisms.","['Scherer, Myriam', 'Otto, Victoria', 'Stump, Joachim D', 'Klingl, Stefan', 'Muller, Regina', 'Reuter, Nina', 'Muller, Yves A', 'Sticht, Heinrich', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Scherer M', 'Otto V', 'Stump JD', 'Klingl S', 'Muller R', 'Reuter N', 'Muller YA', 'Sticht H', 'Stamminger T']","['Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Biotechnology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Biotechnology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany thomas.stamminger@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151111,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Computational Biology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*immunology/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/05/24 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01973-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01973-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2015 Nov 11;90(3):1190-205. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01973-15.

METHODS: The SUMOylation site of sPRDM16 at K568 was mutated to arginine by site-directed mutagenesis. THP-1 acute myeloid leukemia cells were transduced with a lentivirus containing wild type or K568 mutant sPRDM16. Proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation of transduced THP-1 cells were analyzed both in vitro cell culture and in mouse xenografts. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by RNA-seq. RESULTS: Overexpression of sPRDM16 promoted proliferation, enhanced self-renewal capacity, but inhibited differentiation of THP-1 acute myeloid leukemia cells. We further confirmed that K568 is a bona fide SUMOylation site on sPRDM16. Mutation of the sPRDM16 SUMOylation site at K568 partially abolished the capacity of sPRDM16 to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells both in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Furthermore, THP-1 cells overexpressing sPRDM16-K568R mutant exhibited a distinct gene expression profile from wild type sPRDM16 following incubation with PMA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that K568 SUMOylation of sPRDM16 plays an important role in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Dong, Song', 'Chen, Jieping']","['Dong S', 'Chen J']","[""Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street, Chongqing, 400038, People's Republic of China. dongsonne@yeah.net."", ""Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street, Chongqing, 400038, People's Republic of China. chenjpxn@163.com.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151111,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PRDM16 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1844-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1844-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Nov 11;15:893. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1844-2.,,PMC4641379,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capability to accurately measure ultrasonic scattering properties from cells is crucial in making an ultrasonic cell sorter a reality if ultrasound scattering is to be used as the sensing mechanism as well. To assess the performance of sensing and identifying live single cells with high-frequency ultrasound, an 86-MHz lithium niobate press-focused single-element acoustic transducer was used in a high-frequency ultrasound scattering measurement system that was custom designed and developed for minimizing noise and allowing better mobility. Peak-to-peak echo amplitude, integrated backscatter (IB) coefficient, spectral parameters including spectral slope and intercept, and midband fit from spectral analysis of the backscattered echoes were measured and calculated from a live single cell of two different types on an agar surface: leukemia cells (K562 cells) and red blood cells (RBCs). The amplitudes of echo signals from K562 cells and RBCs were 48.25 +/- 11.98 mV(pp) and 56.97 +/- 7.53 mV(pp), respectively. The IB coefficient was -89.39 +/- 2.44 dB for K562 cells and -89.00 +/- 1.19 dB for RBCs. The spectral slope and intercept were 0.30 +/- 0.19 dB/MHz and -56.07 +/- 17.17 dB, respectively, for K562 cells and 0.78 +/- 0.092 dB/MHz and -98.18 +/- 8.80 dB, respectively, for RBCs. Midband fits of K562 cells and RBCs were -31.02 +/- 3.04 dB and -33.51 +/- 1.55 dB, respectively. Acoustic cellular discrimination via these parameters was tested by Student's t-test.

Current treatment options have made significant progress but the 5 year survival for AML remains low and therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics. Ellipticines, a class of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, have had limited success clinically due to low solubility and toxic side effects. Isoellipticines, novel isomers of ellipticine, have been designed to overcome these limitations. One particular isoellipticine, 7-formyl-10-methylisoellipticine, has previously showed strong ability to inhibit the growth of leukaemia cell lines. In this study the anti-leukaemia effect of this compound was investigated in detail on an AML cell line, MV4-11. Over a period of 24 h 7-formyl-10-methyl isoellipticine at a concentration of 5 muM can kill up to 40 % of MV4-11 cells. Our research suggests that the cytotoxicity of 7-formyl-10-methylisoellipticine is partially mediated by an induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, 7-formyl-10-methylisoellipticine demonstrated promising anti-tumour activity in an AML xenograft mouse model without causing toxicity, implying the potential of isoellipticines as novel chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of leukaemia.","['Russell, Eileen G', 'Guo, Jianfeng', ""O'Sullivan, Elaine C"", ""O'Driscoll, Caitriona M"", 'McCarthy, Florence O', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Russell EG', 'Guo J', ""O'Sullivan EC"", ""O'Driscoll CM"", 'McCarthy FO', 'Cotter TG']","['Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Chemistry and ABCRF, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Chemistry and ABCRF, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry & Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. t.cotter@ucc.ie.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151112,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (7-formyl-10-methylisoellipticine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10637-015-0302-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-015-0302-y [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2016 Feb;34(1):15-23. doi: 10.1007/s10637-015-0302-y.

PROCEDURE: Medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU-CVM) or Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary, NC between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were cats that had complete diagnostic workups, including clinical, clinicopathological, serological, and histopathological data, as well as imaging modalities. Serology was consistently completed for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty cats met the inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of FeLV (2.7%), FIV (7.3%), FCoV (34.7%), T. gondii (23.7%), and Bartonella spp. (43.2%) was observed, with a combined seroprevalence of 59.2%. Nineteen cats (15.8%) were diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) based on clinical, hematological, serological, histopathological, and necropsy findings. The average age of all cases was 7.62 years, while the average age of cats diagnosed with FIP was 1.82 years. Neoplasia was diagnosed in six cats (5.0%). No underlying etiology was found in 49 cats (40.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Both idiopathic and neoplastic causes of uveitis were less prevalent than previously reported in studies, while seropositivity was higher than previously reported for the study area. This may be due to improved diagnostic capabilities or that cats with infectious disease were more likely to be referred. Because of the high prevalence of FIP, young cats with uveitis should be evaluated for hyperglobulinemia and FCoV serology should be performed as minimal diagnostics.","['Jinks, Maggie R', 'English, Robert V', 'Gilger, Brian C']","['Jinks MR', 'English RV', 'Gilger BC']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, NCSU-CVM, Clinical Sciences, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Animal Eye Care Associates, Cary, NC, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, NCSU-CVM, Clinical Sciences, Raleigh, NC, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151112,England,Vet Ophthalmol,Veterinary ophthalmology,100887377,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/microbiology/virology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/veterinary', 'North Carolina/epidemiology', 'Uveitis/etiology/microbiology/*veterinary/virology']",2015/11/13 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vop.12324 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Ophthalmol. 2016 Jul;19 Suppl 1:30-7. doi: 10.1111/vop.12324.

The hypoxic cancer microenvironment generates a powerful signaling interactome with positive-feedback loops that generates cancer robustness through the AKT locus. This complexity and robustness can be successfully halted in leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, plasmocytoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma by converting cancer positive-feedback loops into negative-feedback loops, achieved through the AKT dephosphorylation by redox balancing change. The hyperphosphorylated AKT locus is down-regulated completely to AKT dephosphorylation by redox balancing change, causing conversion of positive-feedback loops and the disappearance of malignant robustness as a direct effect of AKT locus chemotherapy.","['Radisavljevic, Ziv']",['Radisavljevic Z'],"[""Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/08/24 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['634f45605105f90b,314f1a3a192db389 [pii]', '10.1615/critreveukaryotgeneexpr.2015013838 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2015;25(3):199-202. doi: 10.1615/critreveukaryotgeneexpr.2015013838.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is either infused intravenously (IV) or injected intramuscularly (IM), administrations of which are associated with hypersensitivity reaction ranging from localized skin reaction to severe anaphylaxis. A retrospective review of 96 medical records of pediatric ALL patients was performed. We compared the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction associated with IV versus IM administration of pegylated ASNase. Ninety-one patients were included in the final analysis; 31 having received pegylated ASNase IV and 60 receiving it IM. The incidence of any grade >/= 2 hypersensitivity reaction in patients who received IV ASNase was 32.2% compared with 13.3% in the IM group (P=0.032). There was no difference in higher grade hypersensitivity reactions (19.4% vs. 11.7%). Most reactions tended to occur during periods of leukemia therapy that did not include concomitant steroid therapy. Our retrospective analysis indicates that IV administration of pegylated ASNase increases the incidence of low-grade, but not grade 3-4, hypersensitivity reactions compared with IM administration.","['Alrazzak, Muaz', 'Beaupin, Lynda K', 'Kinyoun, Peter', 'Barth, Matthew']","['Alrazzak M', 'Beaupin LK', 'Kinyoun P', 'Barth M']","['Departments of *Pediatric daggerPharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/13 06:00,2016/05/07 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000465 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Jan;38(1):e16-20. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000465.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that serum creatinine alteration after HDMTX administration predicts MTX clearance. Overall, 122 cycles in 50 patients of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged </=18 years receiving HDMTX were enrolled prospectively. Plasma MTX levels were measured at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours; serum creatinine was measured at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Correlation of plasma MTX levels with creatinine levels and changes in creatinine from baseline (Delta creatinine) were evaluated. Plasma MTX levels at 72 hours showed positive correlation with serum creatinine at 48 hours (P = .011) and 72 hours (P = .013) as also Delta creatinine at 48 hours (P = .042) and 72 hours (P = .045). However, cut-off value of either creatinine or Delta creatinine could not be established to reliably predict delayed MTX clearance. Greater than 50% Delta creatinine at 48 and 72 hours significantly predicted grade 3/4 leucopenia (P = .036 and P = .001, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (P = .012 and P = .009, respectively) but not mucositis (P = .827 and P = .910, respectively). Delayed MTX elimination did not predict any grade 3/4 toxicity. In spite of demonstration of significant correlation between serum creatinine and Delta creatinine with plasma MTX levels at 72 hours, cut-off value of either variable to predict MTX delay could not be established. Thus, either of these cannot be used as a surrogate for plasma MTX estimation. Interestingly, Delta creatinine effectively predicted hematological toxicities, which were not predicted by delayed MTX clearance.","['Tiwari, Priya', 'Thomas, M K', 'Pathania, Subha', 'Dhawan, Deepa', 'Gupta, Y K', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Tiwari P', 'Thomas MK', 'Pathania S', 'Dhawan D', 'Gupta YK', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Bakhshi S']","['a Department of Medical Oncology , DR.

This study is to investigate the clinical manifestation of de novo MYCyBCL2 double-hit BCP-ALL in young patients. Two pediatric and one young adult patients were identified after a retrospective data review and all without previous history of lymphoma. There were two females and one male aged 15, 18, and 24, respectively. All patients had an unremarkable medical history before presenting with extensive bone marrow and central nervous system involvement at diagnosis. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis showed an immature B-cell immunophenotype (CD10+, CD19+, TdT+, surface Ig-) and immunohistochemistry showed high expression of MYC and BCL2 in all cases. All patients showed complex karyotypes associated with 8q24 abnormalities in the form of t(8;9)(q24;p13) or t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed MYC and BCL2 rearrangements.

Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing studies have revealed recurrently occurring somatic mutations in some genes. Several other prognostic markers have previously been tested for their prognostic value in CLL. LPL is among these markers. AIM: To evaluate LPL gene expression together with the well-established prognostic markers of CLL and investigate correlations with more recently identified prognostic markers, NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations. METHODS: On 149 patients, LPL gene expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Exon 34 of NOTCH1 was PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. RESULTS: LPL gene expression could be measured as a categorical variable (LPL+/LPL-) and was associated with time to treatment (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.007). In patients otherwise classified as having a good prognosis according to established and new prognostic markers, 3 of 4 patients, who received treatment within 24 months after diagnosis, were LPL+ (P = 0.03). There was a strong correlation between NOTCH1 mutation and LPL+ (P = 0.005). The unfavorable prognosis of LPL+ was maintained in CLL with wild-type NOTCH1. CONCLUSIONS: NOTCH1 mutations are tightly associated with LPL gene expression. LPL expression is independently associated with poor outcome in CLL and can be measured as a categorical variable.","['Kristensen, Louise', 'Kristensen, Thomas', 'Abildgaard, Niels', 'Royo, Cristina', 'Frederiksen, Mikael', 'Mourits-Andersen, Torben', 'Campo, Elias', 'Moller, Michael Boe']","['Kristensen L', 'Kristensen T', 'Abildgaard N', 'Royo C', 'Frederiksen M', 'Mourits-Andersen T', 'Campo E', 'Moller MB']","['Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Hematology, Hospital of Southern Jutland, Aabenraa, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital of Southwestern Jutland, Esbjerg, Denmark.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151217,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",2015/11/13 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/11/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12700 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Aug;97(2):175-82. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12700.

Since the tumor progression effects of S1P and its mechanism in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer is not fully understood, we investigated the role and one of the mechanisms of S1P in tumor progression of SKW3 and H1299 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of S1P on proliferation, invasion and migration was studied using MTT assay, soft-agar colony forming assay and trans-well migration assay, respectively. In order to find out the mechanisms of S1P action, the role of S1P on expression of Survivin gene was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that although invasion was shown only in H1299 cells, low concentration of S1P, especially at 1 muM, mediated proliferation and migration in both cell lines. In addition, these effects of S1P in tumor progression are S1P receptor-dependent, and Survivin plays a key role in S1P tumorigenesis. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the involvement of S1P and its receptors in tumor progression of SKW3 and H1299. We also investigated another mechanism of S1P involved in cell survival, tumor progression, and Survivin signaling. In conclusion, data demonstrated the importance of this molecule as a target for designing new anticancer drugs such as anti-S1P monoclonal antibody for inhibiting major downstream signaling, which plays significant role in tumorigenesis.","['Tabasinezhad, Maryam', 'Ghaedi, Hamid', 'Qanbari, Parisa', 'Mohseni, Mahsa', 'Sabzichi, Mehdi', 'Samadi, Nasser']","['Tabasinezhad M', 'Ghaedi H', 'Qanbari P', 'Mohseni M', 'Sabzichi M', 'Samadi N']","['Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran ; Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran ; Student Research Center Committee, Tabriz university of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Medical Genetics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran ; Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran ; Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran ; Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran ; Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,2015/11/12 06:00,2015/11/12 06:01,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2015 Aug;18(8):813-21.,,PMC4633465,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Invasion', 'Migration', 'Proliferation', 'S1P', 'Survivin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown that T. welwitschii has antibacterial activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate T. welwitschii extract for anticancer activity against Jurkat T cells. The Jurkat T cell line is used to study acute T cell leukaemia. An antiproliferation assay, determination of induction of apoptosis, the determination of the effect of the combination of the extract and GSH, and effects of the extract on DNA leakage were conducted. T. welwitschii was found to decrease cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. T. welwitschii caused apoptosis in the Jurkat T cells as shown by DNA fragmentation. When T. welwitschii was combined with reduced GSH, it was found that the growth of the Jurkat T cells was significantly reduced compared to untreated cells after 72 h of treatment. This was unexpected, as cancer cells have elevated levels of GSH compared to normal cells. The results of this study show that T. welwitschii is a potential source of compounds that may serve as leads for anticancer compounds.","['Moyo, Batanai', 'Mukanganyama, Stanley']","['Moyo B', 'Mukanganyama S']","['Biomolecular Interactions Analyses Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, University of Zimbabwe, P.O.

To eliminate LSCs, the sensitivity of LSCs to chemotherapeutic agents used in conditioning regimens should be enhanced. Curcumin (CUR) has received considerable attention as a result of its anticancer activity in leukemia and solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms in leukemia stem-like KG1a cells exposed to busulfan (BUS) and CUR, either alone or in combination. KG1a cells exhibiting BUS-resistance demonstrated by MTT and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assays, compared with HL-60 cells. CUR induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in KG1a cells. Apoptosis of KG1a cells was significantly enhanced by treatment with CUR+BUS, compared with either agent alone. CUR synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of BUS. Seven apoptosis-related proteins were modulated in CUR- and CUR+BUS-treated cells analyzed by proteins array analysis. Importantly, the antiapoptosis protein survivin was significantly downregulated, especially in combination group. Suppression of survivin with specific inhibitor YM155 significantly increased the susceptibility of KG1a cells to BUS. These results demonstrated that CUR could increase the sensitivity of leukemia stem-like KG1a cells to BUS by downregulating the expression of survivin.","['Weng, Guangyang', 'Zeng, Yingjian', 'Huang, Jingya', 'Fan, Jiaxin', 'Guo, Kunyuan']","['Weng G', 'Zeng Y', 'Huang J', 'Fan J', 'Guo K']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangmen Wuyi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Jiangmen 529000, China.', 'Department of hemodialysis, Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangmen Wuyi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Jiangmen 529000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151018,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Busulfan/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Survivin']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/08/27 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/630397 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:630397. doi: 10.1155/2015/630397.

The ERK signaling pathway is dysregulated in cancer cells, including lung cancer, and this dysregulation promotes proliferation and cell invasion. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with ATRA can activate the ERK signaling pathway by a transcription-independent mechanism through a signaling cascade that involves RARalpha and PI3K, promoting growth, survival, and migration in lung cancer cells. Until now, this mechanism was unknown in lung cancer cells. The inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway restores the beneficial effects of ATRA, reduces proliferation, increases apoptosis, and blocks the cell migration process in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of ATRA with ERK inhibitor in clinical trials for lung cancer is warranted.","['Quintero Barceinas, Reyna Sara', 'Garcia-Regalado, Alejandro', 'Arechaga-Ocampo, Elena', 'Villegas-Sepulveda, Nicolas', 'Gonzalez-De la Rosa, Claudia Haydee']","['Quintero Barceinas RS', 'Garcia-Regalado A', 'Arechaga-Ocampo E', 'Villegas-Sepulveda N', 'Gonzalez-De la Rosa CH']","['Departamento de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Cuajimalpa, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga 4871, 05348 Colonia Santa Fe Cuajimalpa, DF, Mexico.', 'Facultad de Enfermeria, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Avenida Nino Artillero 130, 78240 Zona Universitaria, SLP, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Cuajimalpa, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga 4871, 05348 Colonia Santa Fe Cuajimalpa, DF, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Avenida Instituto Politecnico Nacional 2508, 14740 Colonia San Pedro Zacatenco, DF, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Cuajimalpa, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga 4871, 05348 Colonia Santa Fe Cuajimalpa, DF, Mexico.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151018,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/08/27 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2014/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/404368 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:404368. doi: 10.1155/2015/404368.

In this study, by using high resolution 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, as many as 2000 protein spots could be detected and those whose expression was specifically up- or downregulated in Jurkat T cells responsive to the treatment with 2-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (GHTT) can be identified. GHTT treatment can upregulate thirteen proteins involved in signal transduction, detoxification, metabolism, energy pathways, and channel transport in Jurkat cells. Nine proteins, that is, thioredoxin-like proteins, BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID protein involving apoptosis), methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase beta chain, and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, were downregulated in GHTT-treated Jurkat cells. Further, bioinformatics tool, Ingenuity software, was used to predict signaling pathways based on the data obtained from the differential proteomics approach. Two matched pathways, relevant to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, in Jurkat cells were inferred from the proteomics data. Biochemical analysis further verified both pathways involving GHTT in Jurkat cells. These findings do not merely prove the feasibility of combining proteomics and bioinformatics methods to identify cellular proteins as key players in response to the phytocompound in Jurkat cells but also establish the pathways of the proteins as the potential therapeutic targets of leukemia.","['Shiau, Jeng-Yuan', 'Yin, Shu-Yi', 'Chang, Shu-Lin', 'Hsu, Yi-Jou', 'Chen, Kai-Wei', 'Kuo, Tien-Fen', 'Feng, Ching-Shan', 'Yang, Ning-Sun', 'Shyur, Lie-Fen', 'Yang, Wen-Chin', 'Wen, Tuan-Nan']","['Shiau JY', 'Yin SY', 'Chang SL', 'Hsu YJ', 'Chen KW', 'Kuo TF', 'Feng CS', 'Yang NS', 'Shyur LF', 'Yang WC', 'Wen TN']","['Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan ; Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, 4F, No. 81, Chang-Xing Street, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan ; Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, 4F, No. 81, Chang-Xing Street, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan ; Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, 4F, No. 81, Chang-Xing Street, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, No. 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan ; Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, 4F, No. 81, Chang-Xing Street, Taipei, Taiwan ; Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Life Sciences Building 2F-7F, 250 Kuo Kuang Road, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151018,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2015/11/12 06:00,2015/11/12 06:01,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/475610 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015;2015:475610. doi: 10.1155/2015/475610.

We previously showed that the Hsp90 inhibitor, SNX-7081, synergizes with and restores sensitivity to fludarabine nucleoside (2-FaraA) in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with lesions in the p53 pathway (Best OG, et al., Leukemia Lymphoma 53:1367-75, 2012). Here, we used label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to determine the mechanism of this synergy. We propose that 2-FaraA-induced DNA damage is compounded by SNX-7081-mediated inhibition of DNA repair, resulting in enhanced induction of apoptosis. DNA damage responses are impaired in part due to reductions in checkpoint regulators BRCA1 and cyclin D1, and cell death is triggered following reductions of MYC and nucleolin and an accumulation of apoptosis-inducing NFkB2 p100 subunit. Loss of nucleolin can activate Fas-mediated apoptosis, leading to the increase of pro-apoptotic proteins (BID, fas-associated factor-2) and subsequent apoptosis of p53-negative, 2-FaraA refractory CLL cells. A significant induction of DNA damage, indicated by increases in DNA damage marker gammaH2AX, was observed following the dual drug treatment of additional cell lines, indicating that a similar mechanism may operate in other p53-mutated human B-lymphoid cancers. These results provide valuable insight into the synergistic mechanism between SNX-7081 and 2-FaraA that may provide an alternative treatment for CLL patients with p53 mutations, for whom therapeutic options are currently limited. Moreover, this drug combination reduces the effective dose of the Hsp90 inhibitor and may therefore alleviate any toxicity encountered.","['Kaufman, Kimberley L', 'Jenkins, Yiping', 'Alomari, Munther', 'Mirzaei, Mehdi', 'Best, O Giles', 'Pascovici, Dana', 'Mactier, Swetlana', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Haynes, Paul A', 'Christopherson, Richard I']","['Kaufman KL', 'Jenkins Y', 'Alomari M', 'Mirzaei M', 'Best OG', 'Pascovici D', 'Mactier S', 'Mulligan SP', 'Haynes PA', 'Christopherson RI']","['School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Molecular Neuropathology, Brain and Mind Centre, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute for Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia.', 'Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute for Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SNX-7081)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (nucleolin)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'BRCA1 Protein/metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['5715 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5715 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 1;6(38):40981-97. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5715.,,PMC4747384,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hsp90 inhibitor', 'MYC', 'NFkB2', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'fludarabine nucleoside']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is likely that genomic variation in the host, infecting microbe, and commensal microbiota are key determinants of infectious disease clinical outcomes. However, until recently, simultaneous, multiomic investigation of infecting microbe and holobiont components has rarely been explored. Herein, we characterized the infecting microbe, host, micro- and mycobiomes leading up to infection onset in a leukemia patient that developed invasive mucormycosis. We discovered that the patient was infected with a strain of the recently described Mucor velutinosus species which we determined was hypervirulent in a Drosophila challenge model and has a predisposition for skin dissemination. After completing the infecting M. velutinosus genome and genomes from four other Mucor species, comparative pathogenomics was performed and assisted in identifying 66 M. velutinosus-specific putatively secreted proteins, including multiple novel secreted aspartyl proteinases which may contribute to the unique clinical presentation of skin dissemination. Whole exome sequencing of the patient revealed multiple non-synonymous polymorphisms in genes critical to control of fungal proliferation, such as TLR6 and PTX3. Moreover, the patient had a non-synonymous polymorphism in the NOD2 gene and a missense mutation in FUT2, which have been linked to microbial dysbiosis and microbiome diversity maintenance during physiologic stress, respectively. In concert with host genetic polymorphism data, the micro- and mycobiome analyses revealed that the infection developed amid a dysbiotic microbiome with low alpha-diversity, dominated by staphylococci. Additionally, longitudinal mycobiome data showed that M. velutinosus DNA was detectable in oral samples preceding disease onset. Our genome-level study of the host-infecting microbe-commensal triad extends the concept of personalized genomic medicine to the holobiont-infecting microbe interface thereby offering novel opportunities for using synergistic genetic methods to increase understanding of infectious diseases pathogenesis and clinical outcomes.","['Shelburne, Samuel A', 'Ajami, Nadim J', 'Chibucos, Marcus

METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: A 36-year-old woman presented with bilateral conjunctival hyperemia and small papules on the legs and face. After complaining of significant fatigue at 6 months, she was diagnosed with high-risk chronic-type ATL. Ophthalmic examination revealed the formation of bilateral segmental rounded nodules, which were located both at the bulbar conjunctiva around the corneal limbus and at the palpebral conjunctiva around each lacrimal punctum. Although cellular infiltrations were also seen at the corneal subepithelium and stroma, no cellular infiltrations were observed in the anterior chamber, vitreous, or retina. Biopsy was performed of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, and the polymerase chain reaction detected HTLV-1 proviral DNA and monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma-chain gene rearrangement in both samples. Pathological evaluations identified atypical lymphoid cells that were consistent with ATL cells. These analyses confirmed that the rounded nodules were formed in conjunction with the infiltration of ATL cells. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of multiple rounded nodules during ATL cell infiltration into the ocular mucous membrane, especially at the palpebral conjunctiva around the lacrimal punctum, may be a distinguishing feature of ATL.","['Kamoi, Koju', 'Nagata, Yoichi', 'Mochizuki, Manabu', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko']","['Kamoi K', 'Nagata Y', 'Mochizuki M', 'Kobayashi D', 'Ohno N', 'Uchimaru K', 'Tojo A', 'Ohno-Matsui K']","['*Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; daggerDepartment of Ophthalmology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; double daggerDepartment of Human Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; and section signDepartment of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,,IM,"['Adult', 'Conjunctiva/*pathology', 'Eye Diseases/etiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/*pathology', 'Limbus Corneae/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/ICO.0000000000000689 [doi]'],ppublish,Cornea. 2016 Jan;35(1):137-9. doi: 10.1097/ICO.0000000000000689.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We estimated the risk for an autoimmune disease after childhood cancer in a large, population-based setting with outcome measures from comprehensive, nationwide health registries. METHODS: From the national cancer registries of Denmark, Iceland and Sweden, we identified 20 361 1-year survivors of cancer diagnosed before the age of 20 between the start of cancer registration in the 1940s and 1950s through 2008; 125 794 comparison subjects, matched by age, gender and country, were selected from national population registers. Study subjects were linked to the national hospital registers. Standardised hospitalisation rate ratios (SHRRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Childhood cancer survivors had a significantly increased SHRR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.5) of all autoimmune diseases combined, corresponding to an AER of 67 per 100 000 person-years. The SHRRs were significantly increased for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (16.3), Addison's disease (13.9), polyarteritis nodosa (5.8), chronic rheumatic heart disease (4.5), localised scleroderma (3.6), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (3.4), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (3.1), pernicious anaemia (2.7), sarcoidosis (2.2), Sjogren's syndrome (2.0) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (1.6). The SHRRs for any autoimmune disease were significantly increased after leukaemia (SHRR 1.6), Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.6), renal tumours (1.6) and central nervous system neoplasms (1.4). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for certain types of autoimmune diseases. These findings underscore the need for prolonged follow-up of these survivors.","['Holmqvist, Anna Sallfors', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Moell, Christian', 'Mansson, Bengt', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck']","['Holmqvist AS', 'Olsen JH', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Garwicz S', 'Hjorth L', 'Moell C', 'Mansson B', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Hasle H', 'Winther JF']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Icelandic Cancer Registry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['ALiCCS study group'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151110,England,Ann Rheum Dis,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,0372355,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events/*statistics & numerical data', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/12 06:00,2017/06/02 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['annrheumdis-2015-207659 [pii]', '10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207659 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Rheum Dis. 2016 Sep;75(9):1622-9. doi: 10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207659.

We focus here on the receptor gene Xpr1 (xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1) for murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). In a previous screen for selective sweeps in mouse populations we discovered that a population from Germany was almost monomorphic for Xpr1 haplotypes, while a population from France was polymorphic. RESULTS: Here we analyze Xpr1 sequences and haplotypes from a broad sample of wild mouse populations of two subspecies, M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus, to trace the origins of this distinctive polymorphism pattern. We show that the high polymorphism in the population in France is caused by a relatively recent invasion of a haplotype from a population in Iran, rather than a selective sweep in Germany. The invading haplotype codes for a novel receptor variant, which has itself undergone a recent selective sweep in the Iranian population. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a scenario in which Xpr1 is frequently subject to positive selection, possibly as a response to resistance development against recurrently emerging infectious viruses. During such an infection cycle, receptor variants that may convey viral resistance can be captured from another population and quickly introgress into populations actively dealing with the infectious virus.","['Hasenkamp, Natascha', 'Solomon, Terry', 'Tautz, Diethard']","['Hasenkamp N', 'Solomon T', 'Tautz D']","['Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306, Plon, Germany. hasenkamp@evolbio.mpg.de.', 'Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306, Plon, Germany. tsolomon@ucsd.edu.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. tsolomon@ucsd.edu.', 'Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306, Plon, Germany. tautz@evolbio.mpg.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151110,England,BMC Evol Biol,BMC evolutionary biology,100966975,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Asia, Western', 'Base Sequence', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Europe', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genetics, Population', 'Haplotypes', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice/classification/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Population Dynamics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12862-015-0528-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12862-015-0528-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Evol Biol. 2015 Nov 10;15:248. doi: 10.1186/s12862-015-0528-5.,['T32 GM008666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4641351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testing is often performed using Sanger sequencing (SS) which has relatively poor sensitivity. Given the widespread adoption of next generation sequencing (NGS), we sought to reevaluate the testing in the context of NGS methods. We developed an NGS-based BCR-ABL1 mutation test on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) to test for resistance mutations, primarily in the kinase domain in BCR-ABL1. We analyzed 508 clinical samples from patients with Ph+ leukemias. In a subset of these samples (n = 97), we conducted a comparison of the NGS results to a classical SS-based test. NGS facilitated detection of low-level mutations (<20 % allele frequency) that were not detectable by SS. In a subset of cases with multiple mutations, NGS was also able to determine if two mutations were on the same molecule (compound) or on separate molecules (polyclonal) but this was limited by the distance between mutated positions and by the effects of apparent distance-dependent PCR recombination. We found 22 compound mutations that centered on one or two key residues including two novel compound mutants: Q252H/Y253H and F311Y/F359I. The advantages of NGS make it a superior method for inventorying BCR-ABL1 resistance mutations.

However, there is a clear recognition within the academic, care delivery and pharmaceutical/biotech communities that our current model of clinical trial discovery and development is no longer fit for purpose. Delivering transformative cancer care should increasingly be our mantra, rather than maintaining the status quo of, at best, the often miniscule incremental benefits that are observed with many current clinical trials. As we enter the era of precision medicine for personalised cancer care (precision and personalised medicine), it is important that we capture and utilise our greater understanding of the biology of disease to drive innovative approaches in clinical trial design and implementation that can lead to a step change in cancer care delivery. A number of advances have been practice changing (e.g. imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukaemia, Herceptin in erb-B2-positive breast cancer), and increasingly we are seeing the promise of a number of newer approaches, particularly in diseases like lung cancer and melanoma. Targeting immune checkpoints has recently yielded some highly promising results. New algorithms that maximise the effectiveness of clinical trials, through for example a multi-stage, multi-arm type design are increasingly gaining traction. However, our enthusiasm for the undoubted advances that have been achieved are being tempered by a realisation that these new approaches may have significant cost implications. This article will address these competing issues, mainly from a European perspective, highlight the problems and challenges to healthcare systems and suggest potential solutions that will ensure that the cost/value rubicon is addressed in a way that allows stakeholders to work together to deliver optimal cost-effective cancer care, the benefits of which can be transferred directly to our patients.","['Lawler, Mark', 'Sullivan, Richard']","['Lawler M', 'Sullivan R']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151111,Switzerland,Public Health Genomics,Public health genomics,101474167,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic/economics/*methods/standards', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'European Union/economics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/economics/*genetics', 'Precision Medicine/economics/standards/*trends']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['000441555 [pii]', '10.1159/000441555 [doi]']",ppublish,Public Health Genomics. 2015;18(6):329-37. doi: 10.1159/000441555.

In both mice and humans, IRF8 is required for the differentiation of most monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, but suppresses neutrophil production. IRF8 mutations can cause immunodeficiency, and the dysregulated differentiation that underlies myeloid leukemia has been attributed in part to reduced IRF8 expression. In this review we discuss recent studies that have revealed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of myelopoiesis by IRF8, which cooperates with other transcription factors to control the initiation of gene expression programs that define the development of specific myeloid cell subsets. RECENT FINDINGS: It is now clear that IRF8 regulates cell fate choice by both promoting monocyte/dendritic cell differentiation and suppressing neutrophil differentiation. Recent studies have shown that it collaborates with PU.1 to promote monocyte gene expression (in part via induction of Kruppel-like factor-4), associates with Batf3 to induce CD8alpha conventional dendritic cell differentiation via autoregulation of its own expression, and restricts neutrophil gene expression by disrupting the binding of c/EBPalpha to target genes. SUMMARY: These studies have emphasized the importance of IRF8 in the regulation of myelopoiesis and are revealing novel therapeutic targets.","['Yanez, Alberto', 'Goodridge, Helen S']","['Yanez A', 'Goodridge HS']","['aBoard of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute bResearch Division of Immunology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center cDavid Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Monocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*metabolism']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000196 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jan;23(1):11-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000196.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, accumulating evidence is showing that malignant cells engage in novel associations/interdependencies with reprogrammed immune and stromal cells in the TME that provide crucial contributions to the licencing of tumour progression and immune evasion (suppression of antitumor immune responses). In this review, we outline TME-driven contributions to the licencing of immune evasion mechanisms including the expression and activity of the immune checkpoint network, focussing on two types of B cell malignancy: indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

The interaction of FLNA and MKL1 was required for the expression of MKL1 target genes in primary fibroblasts, melanoma, mammary and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We identified the regions of interaction between MKL1 and FLNA, and cells expressing an MKL1 mutant that was unable to bind FLNA exhibited impaired cell migration and reduced expression of MKL1-SRF target genes. Induction and repression of MKL1-SRF target genes correlated with increased or decreased MKL1-FLNA interaction, respectively. Lysophosphatidic acid-induced RhoA activation in primary human fibroblasts promoted the association of endogenous MKL1 with FLNA, whereas exposure to an actin polymerization inhibitor dissociated MKL1 from FLNA and decreased MKL1-SRF target gene expression in melanoma cells. Thus, FLNA functions as a positive cellular transducer linking actin polymerization to MKL1-SRF activity, counteracting the known repressive complex of MKL1 and monomeric G-actin.","['Kircher, Philipp', 'Hermanns, Constanze', 'Nossek, Maximilian', 'Drexler, Maria Katharina', 'Grosse, Robert', 'Fischer, Maximilian', 'Sarikas, Antonio', 'Penkava, Josef', 'Lewis, Thera', 'Prywes, Ron', 'Gudermann, Thomas', 'Muehlich, Susanne']","['Kircher P', 'Hermanns C', 'Nossek M', 'Drexler MK', 'Grosse R', 'Fischer M', 'Sarikas A', 'Penkava J', 'Lewis T', 'Prywes R', 'Gudermann T', 'Muehlich S']","['Walther Straub Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Walther Straub Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Walther Straub Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Walther Straub Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Biochemical-Pharmacological Center, University of Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Technical University Munich, Munich 80802, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Technical University Munich, Munich 80802, Germany.', 'Walther Straub Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.', 'Walther Straub Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich 80336, Germany.

For example, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for chronic myeloid leukaemia patients (CML) is often delayed. In Bosnia, 16% of patients received immediate TKI treatment (<3 months of diagnosis), while 66% of patients received therapy after a median 14-month wait period. To assess the effect of delayed treatment on outcome, three patient groups were studied according to the time they received TKI treatment (0-5 months, 6-12 months and >13 months delay). The primary endpoints were complete cytogenetic (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. At 12 months of therapy, CCyR and MMR rates on imatinib decreased significantly: CCyR was achieved in 67% of patients in the immediate imatinib treatment group, 18% of patients in 6-12 months group and 15% of patients in >13 months wait group. MMR rates at 12 months occurred in 10% of patients with immediate treatment, 6% of those in 6-12 months group and 0% of patients in >13 months wait group. However, CCyR and MMR rates in patients on nilotinib were not associated with duration of treatment delay. Our data suggests that the deleterious effect of a prolonged TKI therapy delay may be ameliorated by the more active TKI nilotinib.","['Kurtovic-Kozaric, Amina', 'Hasic, Azra', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Bijedic, Vildan', 'Nefic, Hilada', 'Eminovic, Izet', 'Kurtovic, Sabira', 'Colakovic, Ferida', 'Kozaric, Mirza', 'Vranic, Semir', 'Bovan, Nada S']","['Kurtovic-Kozaric A', 'Hasic A', 'Radich JP', 'Bijedic V', 'Nefic H', 'Eminovic I', 'Kurtovic S', 'Colakovic F', 'Kozaric M', 'Vranic S', 'Bovan NS']","['Department of Pathology, University Clinical Centre Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Genetics and Bioengineering, International Burch University, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Haematology Clinic, University Clinical Centre Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Haematology Clinic, University Clinical Centre Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Haematology Clinic, Cantonal Hospital Zenica, Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Centre for Mother and Child, University Clinical Centre Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Genetics and Bioengineering, International Burch University, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Pathology, University Clinical Centre Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hospital Mostar, Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20151111,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', '*Developing Countries', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13843 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Feb;172(3):420-7. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13843.

Average hollow core size of hmPCL nanocapsules used for nanoformulation is ~180 nm with shell thickness of 10-20 nm and mesopore size of ~5-10nm in diameter. Idiosyncratic capsules are biocompatible which has been confirmed with normal lymphocyte, K562 leukaemia cancer cells and on HepG2/EGFP cancer cells. In 1mg of hmPCL capsules up to 400 ng of siRNA can be loaded. This nanoformulation enables to tune the dose dependent delivery up to ~93.25% (373 ng) siRNA during therapy. hmPCL-siRNA nanoformulation mediated siRNA transfection on HepG2 cancer cells has been investigated and exhibited 32% silencing activity within 24h of post transfection. Obtained results directed us that the hmPCL-siRNA nanoformulation could be an efficient tool in siRNA mediated therapy for knocking down the infected cells. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: siRNA could be used in cancer therapy if naked nucleic acid could be transported using a suitable carrier. In this article, the authors developed a nano-carrier system using mesoporous polycaprolactone (hmPCL) and showed its efficacy in knocking down cancer cells. This approach may open another way of gene therapy.","['Kumar, Vijay Bhooshon', 'Medhi, Himadri', 'Yong, Zhang', 'Paik, Pradip']","['Kumar VB', 'Medhi H', 'Yong Z', 'Paik P']","['School of Engineering Sciences and Technology, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.

We report here a novel oncolytic adenovirus vector redirected to CD47+ leukemia cells though carrying a sCAR-4N1 expression cassette in the viral genome, forming Ad.4N1, in which 4N1 represents the C-terminal CD47-binding domain of thrombospondin-1. The infection and cytotoxicity of Ad.4N1 in leukemia cells were determined to be mediated by the 4N1-CD47 interaction. Ad.4N1 was further engineered to harbor a gene encoding melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), forming Ad.4N1-IL24, which replicated dramatically faster than Ad.4N1, and elicited significantly enhanced antileukemia effect in vitro and in a HL60/Luc xenograft mouse model. Our data suggest that Ad.4N1 could act as a novel oncolytic adenovirus vector for CD47+ leukemia targeting gene transfer, and Ad.4N1 harboring anticancer genes may provide novel antileukemia agents.","['Li, Gongchu', 'Wu, Hu', 'Cui, Lianzhen', 'Gao, Yajun', 'Chen, Lei', 'Li, Xin', 'Liang, Tianxiang', 'Yang, Xinyan', 'Cheng, Jianhong', 'Luo, Jingjing']","['Li G', 'Wu H', 'Cui L', 'Gao Y', 'Chen L', 'Li X', 'Liang T', 'Yang X', 'Cheng J', 'Luo J']","['College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of life sciences, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (interleukin-24)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD47 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*methods', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/10/12 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['6292 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6292 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 22;6(41):43496-507. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6292.,,PMC4791246,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD47', 'interleukin-24', 'leukemia', 'oncolytic adenovirus', 'thrombospondin-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific inhibitors against BCR-ABL, such as Imatinib mesylate (IM), have greatly improved CML management; however, no single agent is a cure yet. Delivery of microRNA (miRNA) using non-viral vectors has been utilized to inhibit various cancer cells; however, the efficacy of this approach to target CML stem/progenitor cells has not been elucidated. In this study, we firstly validated that spermine-introduced pullulan (Ps) was a robust non-viral vector for delivery of miRNA to CML cells, including the CD34+ cells from clinical isolates. We then found that the miR-181a/RALA (V-ral simian leukemia viral oncogene homolog A) axis was aberrantly expressed in the CML CD34+ cells. The delivery of miR-181a specifically inhibited the growth of CML CD34+ cells, possibly via the inhibition of RALA. In contrast, miR-181a did not evidently affect the normal hematopoietic CD34+ cells. In addition, miR-181a increased IM sensitivity of the CD34+ CML cells. Taken together, we have therefore demonstrated that the delivery of miR-181a using Ps to CML stem/progenitor cells leads to their growth inhibition and enhancement of IM sensitivity, which will possibly be beneficial to CML treatment.","['Ma, Wenjuan', 'Liu, Jian', 'Xie, Jundan', 'Zhang, Xiuyan', 'Zhou, Haixia', 'Yao, Hong', 'Zhang, Weiqi', 'Guo, Dawei', 'Zhu, Lingying', 'Xiao, Lun', 'Wu, Depei', 'Xu, Haiyan', 'Chen, Suning', 'Zhao, Yun']","['Ma W', 'Liu J', 'Xie J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou H', 'Yao H', 'Zhang W', 'Guo D', 'Zhu L', 'Xiao L', 'Wu D', 'Xu H', 'Chen S', 'Zhao Y']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucans)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8ZQ0AYU1TT (pullulan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Glucans/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/genetics/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nanomedicine', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/12 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2015/11/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2015.2147 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2015 Nov;11(11):1961-74. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2015.2147.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to analyze outcomes of AML patients enrolled in phase I studies to determine whether overall response rates (ORR) and mortality rates have changed over time. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 711 adult AML patients enrolling in 45 phase I clinical trials supported by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the National Cancer Institute from 1986 to 2009. Changes in ORR and mortality rates for patients enrolled in 1986 to 1990, 1991 to 1995, 1996 to 2000, 2001 to 2005, and 2006 to 2009 were estimated with multivariable logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in AML patients enrolling in phase I clinical trials over time (1986 to 1990: n = 61; 2006 to 2009: n = 256; P = .03). The ORR for the entire cohort was 15.4% (1986 to 1990: 8.9%, 1991 to 1995: 21.1%; 1996 to 2000: 7.0%; 2001 to 2005: 10.0%; 2006 to 2009: 22.6%), and it statistically significantly improved over time (P < .001). There was a statistically significant improvement in ORRs with novel agents in combination vs single agents (ORR = 22.8% vs 4.7%, respectively, odds ratio = 5.95, 95% confidence interval = 3.22 to 11.9, P < .001). The 60-day mortality rate for the entire cohort was 22.6%, but it statistically significantly improved over time (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: There has been an encouraging increase in AML patients enrolling in phase I clinical studies over time. The improvement in ORRs appears to be partly because of the increase in combination trials and the inclusion of previously untreated poor-risk AML. Continued enrollment of AML patients in early phase clinical trials is vital for drug development and improvement in therapeutic outcomes.","['Zeidner, Joshua F', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Blackford, Amanda L', 'Foster, Matthew C', 'Dees, E Claire', 'Smith, Gary', 'Ivy, S Percy', 'Harris, Pamela']","['Zeidner JF', 'Karp JE', 'Blackford AL', 'Foster MC', 'Dees EC', 'Smith G', 'Ivy SP', 'Harris P']","['Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .', 'Affiliations of authors: University of North Carolina, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Chapel Hill, NC (JFZ, MCF, ECD); Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Baltimore, MD (JEK, ALB); Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program , National Cancer Institute , Rockville, MD (GS, SPI, PH) .']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151109,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/02/20 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['djv335 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djv335 [doi]']",epublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2015 Nov 9;108(3). pii: djv335. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djv335.

The effects of mutations in IDH2 on cellular metabolism, the epigenetic state of mutated cells, and cellular differentiation have been elucidated in vitro and in vivo. Mutations in IDH2 lead to an enzymatic gain of function that catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to beta-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Supranormal levels of 2-HG lead to hypermethylation of epigenetic targets and a subsequent block in cellular differentiation.

Although some key transcription factors are known, the epigenetic mechanisms modulating TGFBIp and ECM expression remain unclear. We examined the role of chromatin markers such as histone H3 lysine methylation (H3Kme) in TGFbeta1-induced TGFBIp and ECM gene expression in normal and GCD2-derived human corneal fibroblasts. METHODS: Wild-type (n = 3), GCD2-heterozygous (n = 1), and GCD2-homozygous (n = 3) primary human corneal fibroblasts were harvested from human donors and patients prepared. Microarray and gene-expression profiling, Chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray analysis, and Methylated DNA isolation assay-assisted CpG microarrays was performed in Wild-type and GCD2-homozygous human cells. RESULTS: Transcription and extracellular-secretion levels of TGFBIp were high in normal cells compared with those in GCD2-derived cells and were related to H3K4me3 levels but not to DNA methylation over the TGFBI locus. TGFbeta1 increased the expression of TGFBIp and the ECM-associated genes connective tissue growth factor, collagen-alpha2[Iota], and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in normal corneal fibroblasts. Increased levels of gene-activating markers (H3K4me1/3) and decreased levels of repressive markers (H3K27me3) at the promoters of those gene accompanied the changes in expression. TGFbeta1 also increased recruitment of the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 and of SET7/9 and also the binding of Smad3 to the promoters. Knockdown of both MLL1 and SET7/9 significantly blocked the TGFbeta1-induced gene expression and inhibited TGFbeta1-induced changes in promoter H3K4me1/3 levels. Those effects were very weak, however, in GCD2-derived corneal fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results show the functional role of H3K4me in TGFbeta1-mediated TGFBIp and ECM gene expression in corneal fibroblasts. Pharmacologic and other therapies that regulate these modifications could have potential cornea-protective effects for granular corneal dystrophy.","['Maeng, Yong-Sun', 'Lee, Ga-Hyun', 'Choi, Seung-Il', 'Kim, Kyu Seo', 'Kim, Eung Kweon']","['Maeng YS', 'Lee GH', 'Choi SI', 'Kim KS', 'Kim EK']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Corneal Dystrophy Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Corneal Dystrophy Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Corneal Dystrophy Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.', 'Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Corneal Dystrophy Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 250 Seongsanno, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea. mysdm70@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Vision Research, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. mysdm70@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151109,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '148710-76-3 (betaIG-H3 protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETD7 protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'Corneal dystrophy Avellino type']",IM,"['Cornea/cytology/pathology', 'Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/*pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Smad3 Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-015-0151-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-015-0151-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2015 Nov 9;8:74. doi: 10.1186/s12920-015-0151-8.,,PMC4638082,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This qualitative article elucidates how patients with AL experience the different conditions of the inpatient and outpatient settings and how they reflect on these transitions in order to create meaning in and keep up everyday life. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured individual interviews twice with each AL patient focusing on the outpatient setting, impact on everyday life, responsibility and the home were performed. Twenty-two patients were interviewed the first time, and 15 of these were interviewed the second time. The data were analyzed in an everyday life relational perspective. RESULTS: Outpatient management facilitates time to be administrated by the patients and thereby the possibility of maintaining everyday life, which was essential to the patients. The privacy ensured by the home was important to patients, and they accepted the necessary responsibility that came with it. However, time spent together with fellow patients and their relatives was an important and highly valued part of their social life. CONCLUSIONS: Approached from the patient perspective, outpatient management provided a motivation for patients as it ensured their presence at home and provided the possibility of taking part in everyday life of the family, despite severe illness and intensive treatment. This may suggest a potential for extending the outpatient management further and also for patient involvement in own care.","['Jepsen, Lene Ostergaard', 'Hoybye, Mette Terp', 'Hansen, Dorte Gilsa', 'Marcher, Claus Werenberg', 'Friis, Lone Smidstrup']","['Jepsen LO', 'Hoybye MT', 'Hansen DG', 'Marcher CW', 'Friis LS']","['Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Sdr.

The majority of the HTLV-1 proviral load is found in CD4(+) T cells, and the phenotype of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is typically CD4(+). HTLV-1 also infects CD8(+) cells in vivo, but the relative abundance and clonal composition of the two infected subpopulations have not been studied. We used a high-throughput DNA sequencing protocol to map and quantify HTLV-1 proviral integration sites in separated populations of CD4(+) cells, CD8(+) cells and unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12 HTLV-1-infected individuals. RESULTS: We show that the infected CD8(+) cells constitute a median of 5% of the HTLV-1 proviral load. However, HTLV-1-infected CD8(+) clones undergo much greater oligoclonal proliferation than the infected CD4(+) clones in infected individuals, regardless of disease manifestation. The CD8(+) clones are over-represented among the most abundant clones in the blood and are redetected even after several years. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although they make up only 5% of the proviral load, the HTLV-1-infected CD8(+) T-cells make a major impact on the clonal composition of HTLV-1-infected cells in the blood. The greater degree of oligoclonal expansion observed in the infected CD8(+) T cells, contrasts with the CD4(+) phenotype of ATL; cases of CD8(+) adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma are rare. This work is consistent with growing evidence that oligoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells is not sufficient for malignant transformation.","['Melamed, Anat', 'Laydon, Daniel J', 'Al Khatib, Hebah', 'Rowan, Aileen G', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Melamed A', 'Laydon DJ', 'Al Khatib H', 'Rowan AG', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR']","['Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK. anat.melamed07@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK. d.laydon@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK. halkhatib85@hotmail.com.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK. a.rowan@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK. g.p.taylor@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Section of Virology, Imperial College London, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK. c.bangham@imperial.ac.uk.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151109,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology/*virology', 'Clone Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/*virology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Latency']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-015-0221-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-015-0221-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2015 Nov 9;12:91. doi: 10.1186/s12977-015-0221-1.,"['MR/K019090/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '100291/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",PMC4640420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The early immature CD34(+) AML cell subpopulation is frequently impervious to intensive chemotherapy, making them largely responsible for relapse of AML. CD34(+) AML cells have higher level of Bcl-2 protein expression than the CD34(-) subpopulation. As such, development of drugs that specifically target the Bcl-2 may have the potential to eliminate immature CD34(+) AML progenitor cells and provide therapeutic benefit. In this work, we made an attempt to investigate the cytotoxic effect of a novel Bcl-2 family inhibitor, ABT-737, on CD34(+) AML cell lines (KG1a and Kasumi-1) as well as CD34(+) primary AML cells. METHODS: Primary human CD34(+) cells were isolated from bone marrow mononuclear cells using CD34 MicroBead kit. The growth inhibitory effect was measured by cell counting kit-8. Apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V/PI assays. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Inhibition of Bcl-2 by ABT-737 effectively inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in CD34(+) AML cell lines and CD34(+) primary AML cells without affecting CD34(+) normal hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that ABT-737 induced apoptosis associated with caspase-3 activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) degradation. Finally, ABT-737 synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cytarabine and daunorubicin in CD34(+) AML cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings indicate that ABT-737 may offer as a promising molecular targeting agent in CD34(+) AML.","['Rao, Jia', 'Li, Fei', 'Zhang, Rong-Yan', 'Zhou, Huan-Huan', 'Chen, Guo-An']","['Rao J', 'Li F', 'Zhang RY', 'Zhou HH', 'Chen GA']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, NanChang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, NanChang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, NanChang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, NanChang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, NanChang University, Nanchang, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151109,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrophenols/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/11 06:00,2017/04/27 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12420 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Apr;13(2):e144-e152. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12420.

Therefore, efforts to generate inhibitors of CBP/p300 are of clinical value. We developed a specific and potent acetyl-lysine competitive protein-protein interaction inhibitor, I-CBP112, that targets the CBP/p300 bromodomains. Exposure of human and mouse leukemic cell lines to I-CBP112 resulted in substantially impaired colony formation and induced cellular differentiation without significant cytotoxicity. I-CBP112 significantly reduced the leukemia-initiating potential of MLL-AF9(+) acute myeloid leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, I-CBP112 increased the cytotoxic activity of BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 as well as doxorubicin. Collectively, we report the development and preclinical evaluation of a novel, potent inhibitor targeting CBP/p300 bromodomains that impairs aberrant self-renewal of leukemic cells. The synergistic effects of I-CBP112 and current standard therapy (doxorubicin) as well as emerging treatment strategies (BET inhibition) provide new opportunities for combinatorial treatment of leukemia and potentially other cancers.","['Picaud, Sarah', 'Fedorov, Oleg', 'Thanasopoulou, Angeliki', 'Leonards, Katharina', 'Jones, Katherine', 'Meier, Julia', 'Olzscha, Heidi', 'Monteiro,

In the allo-SCT model of C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) --> B6D2F1 (H-2(b/d)), recipients received transplants of wild type (WT) T-cell-depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) and splenic T cells from either WT or MyD88 deficient (MyD88KO) donors. Host-type (H-2(d)) P815 mastocytoma or L1210 leukemia cells were injected either subcutaneously or intravenously to generate a GVHD/GVL model. Allogeneic recipients of MyD88KO T cells demonstrated a greater tumor growth without attenuation of GVHD severity. Moreover, GVHD-induced GVL effect, caused by increasing the conditioning intensity was also not observed in the recipients of MyD88KO T cells. In vitro, the absence of MyD88 in T cells resulted in defective cytolytic activity to tumor targets with reduced ability to produce IFN-gamma or granzyme B, which are known to critical for the GVL effect. However, donor T cell expansion with effector and memory T-cell differentiation were more enhanced in GVHD hosts of MyD88KO T cells. Recipients of MyD88KO T cells experienced greater expansion of Foxp3- and IL4-expressing T cells with reduced INF-gamma producing T cells in the spleen and tumor-draining lymph nodes early after transplantation. Taken together, these results highlight a differential role for MyD88 deficiency on donor T-cells, with decreased GVL effect without attenuation of the GVHD severity after experimental allo-SCT.","['Lim, Ji-Young', 'Ryu, Da-Bin', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Park, Gyeongsin', 'Choi, Eun Young', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Lim JY', 'Ryu DB', 'Lee SE', 'Park G', 'Choi EY', 'Min CK']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea."", ""Department of Pathology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea."", 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151110,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/09/15 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14348/molcells.2015.0158 [doi]', 'molcells.2015.0158 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2015 Nov;38(11):966-74. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2015.0158.

Aberrant DNA methylation pattern is a characteristic feature of cancers and associated with abnormal expression of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes or repair genes. Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins are recently characterized dioxygenases that catalyze progressive oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to produce 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and further oxidized derivatives. These oxidized methylcytosines not only potentiate DNA demethylation but also behave as independent epigenetic modifications per se. The expression or activity of TET proteins and DNA hydroxymethylation are highly dysregulated in a wide range of cancers including hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, and accumulating evidence points TET proteins as a novel tumor suppressor in cancers. Here we review DNA demethylation-dependent and -independent functions of TET proteins. We also describe diverse TET loss-of-function mutations that are recurrently found in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies and their potential roles in hematopoietic transformation. We discuss consequences of the deficiency of individual Tet genes and potential compensation between different Tet members in mice. Possible mechanisms underlying facilitated oncogenic transformation of TET-deficient hematopoietic cells are also described. Lastly, we address non-mutational mechanisms that lead to suppression or inactivation of TET proteins in cancers. Strategies to restore normal 5mC oxidation status in cancers by targeting TET proteins may provide new avenues to expedite the development of promising anti-cancer agents.","['Han, Jae-A', 'An, Jungeun', 'Ko, Myunggon']","['Han JA', 'An J', 'Ko M']","['School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Korea.', 'Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan 689-798, Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151110,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/09/15 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14348/molcells.2015.0294 [doi]', 'molcells.2015.0294 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2015 Nov;38(11):925-35. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2015.0294.

METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted on newly diagnosed APL patients between January 1995 and May 2012. RESULTS: A total of 46 newly diagnosed APL patients were analyzed. Of these, 27 patients (58.7%) showed initial bleeding. The median number of points per patient fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of overt DIC by the ISTH and the KSTH was 5 (range, 1 to 7) and 3 (range, 1 to 4), respectively. At diagnosis of APL, 22 patients (47.8%) fulfilled the overt DIC diagnostic criteria by either the ISTH or KSTH. In multivariate analysis of the ISTH or KSTH diagnostic criteria for overt DIC, the initial fibrinogen level was the only statistically significant factor associated with initial bleeding (p = 0.035), but it was not associated with overall survival (OS). CONCLUSIONS: Initial fibrinogen level is associated with initial presentation of bleeding of APL patients, but does not affect OS.","['Lee, Ho Jin', 'Kim, Dong Hyun', 'Lee, Seul', 'Koh, Myeong Seok', 'Kim, So Yeon', 'Lee, Ji Hyun', 'Lee, Suee', 'Oh, Sung Yong', 'Han, Jin Yeong', 'Kim, Hyo-Jin', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun']","['Lee HJ', 'Kim DH', 'Lee S', 'Koh MS', 'Kim SY', 'Lee JH', 'Lee S', 'Oh SY', 'Han JY', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151030,Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/blood/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/11 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3904/kjim.2015.30.6.884 [doi]', 'kjim-30-6-884 [pii]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2015 Nov;30(6):884-90. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2015.30.6.884.

METHOD: The inhibitory effect of TMP on the proliferation of U937 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The cell apoptosis and cycle distribution were examined by the flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of bcl-2 and P27 were determined by the Real-time PCR. Western blot was carried out to detect bcl-2, caspase-3, cyclin E1, CDK2 and P27 expressions. RESULT: TMP inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells in a dose-and-time dependent manner, with IC50 value of 160 mg x L(-1) at 48 h. In addition, TMP could induce the apoptosis of U937 cells and block the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase. According to the results of Real-time PCR and Western blot, TMP could down-regulate the expression of apoptosis-related molecule bcl-2, cycle-related protein cyclin E1 and CDK2 and up-regulate caspase-3 and P27. CONCLUSION: TMP shows the effects in inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic U937 cells and inducing the apoptosis. Its mechanism may be related to the impacts on the cell cycle distribution, down-regulation of the bcl-2 expression, which finally activates caspase-3, starts the apoptosis path and causes the cell apoptosis.","['Wang, Xiao-jing', 'Yang, Gui-cun', 'Chen, Hong-xia', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Xu, You-hua']","['Wang XJ', 'Yang GC', 'Chen HX', 'Zhang P', 'Xu YH']",,,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'V80F4IA5XG (tetramethylpyrazine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'U937 Cells']",2015/11/11 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/11/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2015 Jun;40(11):2186-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such assessments are an important component of pharmacovigilance, however classification systems for assigning relatedness vary across study protocols. This on-line survey evaluated the consistency of SAE causality assessment among professionals with vaccine clinical trial experience. METHODS: Members of the clinical advisory forum of experts (CAFE), a Brighton Collaboration online-forum, were emailed a survey containing SAEs from hypothetical vaccine trials which they were asked to classify. Participants were randomised to either two classification options (related/not related to study immunisation) or three options (possibly/probably/unrelated). The clinical scenarios, were (i) leukaemia diagnosed 5 months post-immunisation with a live RSV vaccine, (ii) juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 3 months post-immunisation with a group A streptococcal vaccine, (iii) developmental delay diagnosed at age 10 months after infant capsular group B meningococcal vaccine, (iv) developmental delay diagnosed at age 10 months after maternal immunisation with a group B streptococcal vaccine. RESULTS: There were 140 respondents (72 two options, 68 three options). Across all respondents, SAEs were considered related to study immunisation by 28% (leukaemia), 74% (JIA), 29% (developmental delay after infant immunisation) and 42% (developmental delay after maternal immunisation). Having only two options made respondents significantly less likely to classify the SAE as immunisation-related for two scenarios (JIA p=0.0075; and maternal immunisation p=0.045). Amongst study investigators (n=43) this phenomenon was observed for three of the four scenarios: (JIA p=0.0236; developmental delay following infant immunisation p=0.0266; and developmental delay after maternal immunisation p=0.0495). CONCLUSIONS: SAE causality assessment is inconsistent amongst study investigators and can be influenced by the classification systems available to them. There is a pressing need for SAE classification systems to be standardised across study protocols.","['Voysey, Merryn', 'Tavana, Rahele', 'Farooq, Yama', 'Heath, Paul T', 'Bonhoeffer, Jan', 'Snape, Matthew D']","['Voysey M', 'Tavana R', 'Farooq Y', 'Heath PT', 'Bonhoeffer J', 'Snape MD']","['Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) plays a key role in suppressing the progression of disease caused by BLV. T and B cell epitopes in BLV have been studied, but CD8(+) CTL epitopes remain poorly understood. We used a library of 115 synthetic peptides covering the entirety of the Env proteins (gp51 and gp30), the Gag proteins (p15, p24, and p12), and the Tax protein of BLV to identify 11 novel CD8(+) T cell epitopes (gp51N5, gp51N11, gp51N12, gp30N5, gp30N6, gp30N8, gp30N16, tax16, tax18, tax19, and tax20) in four calves experimentally infected with BLV. The number of CD8(+) T cell epitopes that could be identified in each calf correlated with the BLV proviral load. Interestingly, among the 11 epitopes identified, only gp51N11 was capable of inducing CD8(+) T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in all four calves, but it is not a suitable vaccine target because it shows a high degree of polymorphism according to the Wu-Kabat variability index. By contrast, no CTL epitopes were identified from the Gag structural protein. In addition, several epitopes were obtained from gp30 and Tax, indicating that cellular immunity against BLV is strongly targeted to these proteins. CD8(+) CTL epitopes from gp30 and Tax were less polymorphic than epitopes from. Indeed, peptides tax16, tax18, tax19, and tax20 include a leucine-rich activation domain that encompasses a transcriptional activation domain, and the gp30N16 peptide contains a proline-rich region that interacts with a protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 to regulate B cell activation. Moreover, at least one CD8(+) CTL epitope derived from gp30 was identified in each of the four calves. These results indicate that BLV gp30 may be the best candidate for the development of a BLV vaccine.","['Bai, Lanlan', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Isogai, Emiko', 'Kohara, Junko', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Bai L', 'Takeshima SN', 'Isogai E', 'Kohara J', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan; Laboratory of Animal Microbiology, Department of Microbial Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 981-8555, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Animal Microbiology, Department of Microbial Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 981-8555, Japan.', 'Animal Research Center, Hokkaido Research Organization, Shintoku, Hokkaido 081-0038, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.

By a simple amidation reaction, OA-Ara was synthesized successfully with a yield up to 61.32%. It was for the first time to see that the novel prodrug molecules could assemble into the unexpectedly spiral assembly under probe ultrasonication in aqueous solution. The oil/water partition coefficient (Ko/w) and the permeability of cell membrane of the prodrug were significantly increased compared with Ara-C molecules. In addition, OA-Ara molecules were stable in various pH solutions and artificial digestives, which indicated that it could be administrated orally. Cell viability assay showed that the prodrug displayed much higher antiproliferative effect against K562 and HL60 cells due to its improvement of the lipophilicity and penetrability of cell membrane.

Although it provides low incidences of GVHD, the efficacy of Haplo-SCT is still questioned, especially for patients with myeloid malignancies. Thus, we analyzed 60 consecutive patients with refractory (n=30) or high-risk CR (n=30) AML or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) who underwent PT-Cy Haplo-SCT. The median age was 57 years (22-73 years), hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index was 3 in 38 patients (63%) and Haplo-SCT was the second allogeneic transplantation for 10 patients (17%). Although most of patients received PBSC as graft source (n=48, 80%), we found low incidences of grade 3-4 acute (2%) and severe chronic GVHD (4%). Among patients with high-risk CR diseases, 1-year non-relapse mortality, cumulative incidence of relapse, progression-free and overall survivals were 20%, 32%, 47% and 62%, respectively. In patients with refractory disease, corresponding results were 34%, 35%, 32% and 37%, respectively. We conclude that PT-Cy Haplo-SCT could provide promising anti-leukemic effect even in the setting of very advanced diseases. Thus, it represents a viable alternative for high-risk AML/MDS patients without HLA-identical donor.","['Devillier, R', 'Bramanti, S', 'Furst, S', 'Sarina, B', 'El-Cheikh, J', 'Crocchiolo, R', 'Granata, A', 'Chabannon, C', 'Morabito, L', 'Harbi, S', 'Faucher, C', 'Santoro, A', 'Weiller, P-J', 'Vey, N', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Castagna, L', 'Blaise, D']","['Devillier R', 'Bramanti S', 'Furst S', 'Sarina B', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Crocchiolo R', 'Granata A', 'Chabannon C', 'Morabito L', 'Harbi S', 'Faucher C', 'Santoro A', 'Weiller PJ', 'Vey N', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Castagna L', 'Blaise D']","['Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Medicine Faculty, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Medicine Faculty, Marseille, France.', 'Cell Therapy Facility, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Medicine Faculty, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Medicine Faculty, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Humanitas Cancer Center, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Medicine Faculty, Marseille, France.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20151109,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2015/11/10 06:00,2016/10/21 06:00,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2015270 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.270 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Feb;51(2):194-8. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2015.270.

We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert their effects on disease.","['Gaulton, Kyle J', 'Ferreira, Teresa', 'Lee, Yeji', 'Raimondo, Anne', 'Magi, Reedik', 'Reschen, Michael E', 'Mahajan, Anubha', 'Locke, Adam', 'Rayner, N William', 'Robertson, Neil',

FLT3-ITD mutations are heterogeneous with respect to allelic ratio, location, and length of the insertion, with a high mutant-to-wild-type ratio consistently associated with inferior prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the role of alloHCT in first remission in relationship to the allelic ratio and presence or absence of nucleophosmin 1 mutations (NPM1) in the Study Alliance Leukemia AML2003 trial. FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 209 patients and concomitant NPM1 mutations in 148 patients. Applying a predefined cutoff ratio of .8, AML was grouped into high- and low-ratio FLT3-ITD AML (HR(FLT3-ITD) and LR(FLT3-ITD)). Sixty-one patients (29%) were transplanted in first remission. Overall survival (OS) (HR, .3; 95% CI, .16 to .7; P = .004) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR, .4; 95% CI, .16 to .9; P = .02) were significantly increased in patients with HR(FLT3-ITD) AML who received alloHCT as consolidation treatment compared with patients who received consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and wild-type NPM1 who received alloHCT in first remission had increased OS (HR, .3; 95% CI, .1 to .8; P = .02) and EFS (HR, .2; 95% CI, .1 to .8; P = .02), whereas alloHCT in first remission did not have a significant impact on OS and EFS in patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and concomitant NPM1 mutation. In conclusion, our results provide additional evidence that alloHCT in first remission improves EFS and OS in patients with HR(FLT3-ITD) AML and in patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and wild-type NPM1.","['Ho, Anthony D', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Kaufmann, Martin', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Ho AD', 'Schetelig J', 'Bochtler T', 'Schaich M', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Hanel M', 'Rosler W', 'Einsele H', 'Kaufmann M', 'Serve H', 'Berdel WE', 'Stelljes M', 'Mayer J', 'Reichle A', 'Baldus CD', 'Schmitz N', 'Kramer M', 'Rollig C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Thiede C', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Abteilung Innere Medizin V, Hamatologie, Onkologie und Rheumatologie, Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

Because graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and GVL are tightly linked, inhibition of T cell populations that cause GVHD may lead to an unintended increased risk of relapse in the RIC setting. Although not completely understood, etanercept and extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) are thought to ameliorate GVHD without direct T cell inhibition. We hypothesized that adding these 2 agents to a standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) would improve survival by reducing GVHD-related mortality without increasing relapse rates. Therefore, we conducted a prospective phase II clinical trial that incorporated tacrolimus, MMF, etanercept, and ECP as GVHD prophylaxis in 48 patients undergoing RIC unrelated donor transplantation. The preferred RIC was fludarabine 160 mg/m(2) + busulfan 6.4 mg/kg to 12.8 mg/kg +/- total body irradiation 200 cGy. Etanercept .4 mg/kg (maximum dose, 25 mg) was given subcutaneously twice weekly for 8 weeks after HCT and ECP was given for 12 treatments, starting weekly on day 28 weekly and tapering off by day 180. The median age of the study patients was 60 (range, 18 to 71) years. Donors were 7/8 (n = 14, 29%) or 8/8 (n = 34, 71%) HLA matched. All patients engrafted neutrophils at a median of 12 days. The cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD at day 100 was 46%, but it was typically sensitive to initial steroid treatment (84% day 56 complete response/partial response rate). Overall survival at 1 year in this older, frequently mismatched unrelated donor setting was excellent (73%) because of low rates of nonrelapse mortality (21%) and relapse (19%). However, this strategy was not effective at preventing a high incidence of chronic GVHD and late deaths led to a drop in 2-year survival, declining to 56%, reflecting a high incidence of chronic GVHD.","['Kitko, Carrie L', 'Braun, Thomas', 'Couriel, Daniel R', 'Choi, Sung W', 'Connelly, James', 'Hoffmann, Sandra', 'Goldstein, Steven', 'Magenau, John', 'Pawarode, Attaphol', 'Reddy, Pavan', 'Schuler, Charles', 'Yanik, Gregory A', 'Ferrara, James L', 'Levine, John E']","['Kitko CL', 'Braun T', 'Couriel DR', 'Choi SW', 'Connelly J', 'Hoffmann S', 'Goldstein S', 'Magenau J', 'Pawarode A', 'Reddy P', 'Schuler C', 'Yanik GA', 'Ferrara JL', 'Levine JE']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Program, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.

We have previously shown that persistent AML detected by flow cytometry (FC+) before reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) was associated with significantly increased relapse, shorter disease-free survival (DFS), and poorer overall survival (OS), independent of morphologic blast count. We evaluated the effect of FC status on outcomes of alloHCT for AML after either myeloablative conditioning (MAC) or RIC regimens in 203 patients (MAC, n = 80, and RIC, n = 123) with no morphologic evidence of persistent AML pretransplant on marrow biopsy. The allografts included 130 umbilical cord blood (UCB) and 73 sibling donors. We performed central review of pretransplant standard sensitivity FC to identify detectable FC+. Twenty-five patients were FC+, including 15 (18.7%) receiving MAC and 10 (8.1%) RIC alloHCT. Among RIC patients FC+ was associated with significantly inferior relapse, DFS, and OS (multiple regression HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 8.7; P < .01 for relapse; HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.9; P < .01 for DFS; and HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7; P < .01 for OS). In contrast, FC+ status was not associated with relapse or decreased OS after MAC.

Studies have demonstrated overexpression of Pims in cancer. To our knowledge, only a single study has examined Pim-1 in urothelial carcinoma. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3 in urothelial carcinoma and assess for expression that may contribute to disease progression and serve as a site for targeted therapy. METHODS: This retrospective study included 137 cases taken from specimens from the University of Utah, Department of Pathology (2008 to 2011). Tissue was stained with antibodies against Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. Cases were classified into 3 groups, based upon current World Health Organization criteria (invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma [IHG] [n=84], noninvasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma/carcinoma in situ [n=32], and noninvasive low-grade urothelial carcinoma [NILG] [n=21]). Cases were scored and recorded as positive or negative on the basis of the percentage of cells with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining. RESULTS: NILG showed higher expression of Pim-1 (relative expression rate [RER]=2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.183-0.764) and Pim-3 (RER=3.06; 95% CI, 0.423-0.816) compared with other lesions. IHG had lower expression of Pim-1 (RER=0.31; 95% CI, 0.401-0.844) and Pim-3 (RER=0.354; 95% CI, 0.322-0.816) and noninvasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma (NIHG) demonstrated increased expression of Pim-1 and (RER=2.09; 95% CI, 0.124-0.739) and Pim-2 (RER=1.70; 95% CI, 0.151-0.591). At least 1 Pim kinase protein was expressed at the following rates: 49% in IHG, 66% in NIHG, and 76% in NILG. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of urothelial carcinomas express Pim kinases. Pim expression differs in NILG, NIHG, and IHG lesions.","['Albertson, Daniel J', 'Schmidt, Robert L', 'Bearss, Jared J', 'Tripp, Sheryl R', 'Bearss, David J', 'Liu, Ting']","['Albertson DJ', 'Schmidt RL', 'Bearss JJ', 'Tripp SR', 'Bearss DJ', 'Liu T']","['*Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah daggerARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology double daggerHuntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*biosynthesis', '*Urologic Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology', '*Urothelium/enzymology/pathology']",2015/11/10 06:00,2016/08/31 06:00,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000138 [doi]', '00129039-201511000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2015 Nov-Dec;23(10):717-23. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The defining molecular feature of NMC is a chromosomal translocation that joins (in the majority of cases) the nuclear testis gene NUT (NUTM1) to the bromodomain protein family member 4 (BRD4) and thereby creating a fusion oncogene that disrupts cellular differentiation and drives the disease. In this study, we report the case of an adolescent NMC patient presenting with severe facial pain, proptosis and visual impairment due to a mass arising from the ethmoid sinus that invaded the right orbit and frontal lobe. Treatment involved radical resection, including exenteration of the affected eye with the view to consolidate treatment with radiation therapy; however, the patient experienced rapid tumor progression and passed away 79 days post resection. Molecular analysis of the tumor tissue identified a novel in-frame BRD4-NUT transcript, with BRD4 exon 15 fused to the last 124 nucleotides of NUT exon 2 (BRD4-NUT ex15:ex2Deltant1-585). The partial deletion of NUT exon 2 was attributed to a mid-exonic genomic breakpoint and the subsequent activation of a cryptic splice site further downstream within the exon. Inhibition of the canonical 3' acceptor splice site of NUT intron 1 in cell lines expressing the most common NMC fusion transcripts (PER-403, BRD4-NUT ex11:ex2; PER-624, BRD4-NUT ex15:ex2) induced alternative splicing from the same cryptic splice site as identified in the patient. Detection of low levels of an in-frame BRD4-NUT ex11:ex2Deltant1-585 transcript in PER-403 confirmed endogenous splicing from this alternative exon 2 splice site. Although further studies are necessary to assess the clinical relevance of the increasing number of variant fusions described in NMC, the findings presented in this case identify alternative splicing as a mechanism that contributes to this pathogenic complexity.","['Stirnweiss, A', 'McCarthy, K', 'Oommen, J', 'Crook, M L', 'Hardy, K', 'Kees, U R', 'Wilton, S D', 'Anazodo, A', 'Beesley, A H']","['Stirnweiss A', 'McCarthy K', 'Oommen J', 'Crook ML', 'Hardy K', 'Kees UR', 'Wilton SD', 'Anazodo A', 'Beesley AH']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, WA, Australia."", 'Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Cyto Labs Pty Ltd, Perth, WA, Australia.', ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, WA, Australia."", 'Molecular Therapy Laboratory, Western Australian Neuroscience Research Institute, Centre for Comparative Genomics, Murdoch University, Perth, WA, Australia.', ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", 'Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.', ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, West Perth, WA, Australia.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151109,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,2015/11/10 06:00,2015/11/10 06:01,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:01 [medline]']","['oncsis201533 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2015.33 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2015 Nov 9;4:e174. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2015.33.,,PMC4670959,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eradication of LSCs should be a critical and efficient therapeutic approach for the cure of AML. T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) is expressed in most types of AML LSCs, but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); therefore, TIM-3 would be one of the promising therapeutic targets to specifically kill AML LSCs, sparing normal HSCs. In xenograft models reconstituted with human AML LSCs or human normal HSCs, an anti-human TIM-3 mouse antibody with cytotoxic activities exerts a potent anti-leukemic effect by targeting AML LSCs but does not affect normal human hematopoiesis in vivo.

It is an effective agent for patients with CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, for which no standard therapy exists, and it has an acceptable toxicity profile. In addition, because CCR4 is expressed on CD45RA-FOXP3highCD4+ effector regulatory T (Treg) cells, it is an even more attractive target, because Treg cells involved in the tumor escape from host immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Based on this concept, we conducted a clinical study of mogamulizumab for the treatment of CCR4-negative advanced or recurrent solid cancer, with the aim of depleting effector Treg cells and thus boosting anti-cancer immune responses. In this study, mogamulizumab infusion at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg was safe and well tolerated. Four of 10 patients showed stable disease during treatment and showed long-term survival. Mogamulizumab efficiently depleted effector Treg cells even at the lowest dose of 0.1 mg/kg, and an augmentation or induction of specific immune responses to cancer/testis antigens was observed in some patients.

ATLL is usually widely disseminated, and it is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). It is a disease with a long latency, and affected individuals are usually exposed to the virus very early in life. The cumulative incidence of ATLL is estimated to be 2.5% among HTLV-1 carriers. ATLL cells express CD2, CD3, CD5, CD4, and CD25, as well as CCR4 and FoxP3 of the regulatory T-cell marker. HTLV-1 is causally linked to ATLL, but infection alone is not sufficient to result in neoplastic transformation. A significant finding in this connection is that the Tax viral protein leads to transcriptional activation of many genes, while the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor is thought to be important for T-cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Half of ATLL cases retain the ability to express HTLV-1 Tax, which is a target of HTLV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). An increase in HTLV-1-specific CTL responses is observed in some asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Although HTLV-1-specific CTL are also present in the peripheral blood of ATLL patients, they do not expand sufficiently. We investigated the clinicopathological features and analyzed the staining of Tax-specific CTL and FoxP3. Tax-specific CTL correlated inversely with FoxP3, an increase in the ratio of CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages was associated with worse clinical prognosis, and ATLL cell lines proliferated significantly following direct co-culture with M2 macrophages. Several clinical variants of ATLL have been identified: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering. Oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization revealed that genomic loss of 9p21.3 was a significant characteristic of acute-type, but not of chronic-type ATLL. Furthermore, we found that genomic alteration of CD58, which is implicated in immune escape, is more frequently observed in acute than in chronic ATLL. Interestingly, the chronic cases with cell cycle deregulation and disruption of immunosurveillance mechanism were associated with faster progression to acute ATLL. Immune evasion, microenvironment, and genetic alteration are therefore important in the multi-step progression of ATLL lymphomagenesis.","['Ohshima, Koichi']",['Ohshima K'],"['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151110,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/isolation & purification', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Disease Progression', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CCR4/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/isolation & purification', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",2015/11/10 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['000431058 [pii]', '10.1159/000431058 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2015;89 Suppl 1:7-15. doi: 10.1159/000431058.

It is a rare disease that comprises 2-5% of mature lymphocytic leukemia in adults. Here we present a T-PLL patient with CNS involvement. A 74-year-old man admitted to a hospital in April 2014 with vomiting. He was diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and R-CVP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) chemotherapy protocol was started. After the first two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient's mental functions improved. However after the 3(rd) cycle of chemotherapy was given in July 2014 the general situation of the patient deteriorated and ptosis of the left eye and facial paralysis developed. Then the patient was referred to our medical center. An MR of the brain revealed linear contrast enhancement around the bilateral 3(rd), 7(th) and 8(th) cranial nerves which indicated cranial involvement by the lymphoproliferative process (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid cytological examination confirmed the diagnosis. Based on these and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy findings a diagnosis of T-PLL was rendered (Figure 3). In September 2014 the patient died suddenly due to a cardiac arrest. Differential diagnosis is very important in T-PLL. Both T-PLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may present with splenomegaly and lymphocytosis as well as circulating prolymphocytes in blood. Typical CLL cells are like mature lymphocytes with dense nucleus and aggregated chromatin. To conclude, CNS involvement in T-PLL is a rare finding and differential diagnosis of T-PLL is very important.","['Malkan, Umit Yavuz', 'Gunes, Gursel', 'Yayar, Okan', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Yesilirmak, Aysun', 'Uner, Aysegul']","['Malkan UY', 'Gunes G', 'Yayar O', 'Demiroglu H', 'Yesilirmak A', 'Uner A']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University Ankara, Turkey.']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20150815,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,,2015/11/10 06:00,2015/11/10 06:01,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2015 Aug 15;8(8):14207-9. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4613082,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia', 'central nervous system involvement']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It strikes about 1,500 patients in the United States each year. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that arsenic trioxide (ATO) can induce clinical remission in de-novo and APL patients that have relapsed from conventional treatment. Ascorbic acid (AA) is an anti-oxidant and free radical scavenger effective against peroxyl- and hydroxyl-radicals, superoxide, singlet oxygen and peroxynitrite. Although research has shown that AA can prevent cancer by deactivating free radicals before they can damage DNA and initiate tumor growth, there are also published reports indicating that it may act as a pro-oxidant that helps the body's own free radical defense mechanism destroy tumors in their early stages. AIM: The aim of this research was to study the modulatory effect of AA on ATO-induced oxidative stress in leukemia cells. METHODS: In the present investigation, we performed the MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion test for cell viability. We also performed the thiobarbituric acid test to determine the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) production in HL-60 cells co-exposed to ascorbic acid (AA) and ATO. RESULTS: The results of MTT assay indicated that AA exposure potentiates the cytotoxicity of ATO in HL-60 cells, as evidenced by a gradual increase in MDA levels with increasing doses of AA. From these results, we concluded that the addition of the ascorbic acid to ATO-treated HL-60 cells enhances the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these direct in vitro findings, our study provides evidence that AA may extend the therapeutic spectrum of ATO, and improve the clinical outcome associated with ATO monotherapy in vivo.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Brown, Erika', 'Rogers, Christian', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Brown E', 'Rogers C', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, P.O.

MiR-210 is closely related with cancer development; however, whether miR-210 expression level correlates with clinical correlation in AML is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between miR-210 expression and AML prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to examine the expression level of miR-210 in bone marrow and serum obtained from AML patients and healthy controls. Then the correlation between miR-210 expression and a variety of important clinical parameters (such as overall survival, relapse-free survival, and prognostic value) were further studied. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-210 was significantly higher in the bone marrow and serum of AML patients than that of healthy controls (p<0.001). Moreover, miR-210 expression was associated with various AML clinicopathological parameters, including FAB classification and cytogenetics. The serum miR-210 expression level was reduced significantly when the patients achieved complete remission (p=0.02). The high miR-210 expression group had both poorer relapse-free survival (p=0.015) and worse overall survival (p=0.008). In the multivariate analysis model, miR-210 was identified as an independent prognostic marker. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-210 up-regulation was associated with poor prognosis in AML and it might be useful as a marker for predicting the clinical outcome of AML patients.","['Tang, Xiaoqiong', 'Chen, Liping', 'Yan, Xinyu', 'Li, Yuanjie', 'Xiong, Yuanlin', 'Zhou, Xiaohui']","['Tang X', 'Chen L', 'Yan X', 'Li Y', 'Xiong Y', 'Zhou X']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151109,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (MIRN210 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/10 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['894812 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.894812 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2015 Nov 9;21:3427-33. doi: 10.12659/msm.894812.,,PMC4644019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib versus placebo in addition to standard chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done at 25 sites in Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-60 years with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia who had a WHO clinical performance score 0-2, adequate renal and liver function, no cardiac comorbidities, and no recent trauma or operation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two cycles of induction therapy with daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) on days 3-5) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) on days 1-7), followed by three cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy (3 g/m(2) twice daily on days 1, 3, and 5) plus either sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo on days 10-19 of induction cycles 1 and 2, from day 8 of each consolidation, and as maintenance for 12 months. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was scheduled for all intermediate-risk patients with a sibling donor and for all high-risk patients with a matched donor in first remission. Computer-generated randomisation was done in blocks. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, with an event defined as either primary treatment failure or relapse or death, assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. We report the final analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00893373, and the EU Clinical Trials Register (2008-004968-40). FINDINGS: Between March 27, 2009, and Nov 28, 2011, 276 patients were enrolled and randomised, of whom nine did not receive study medication. 267 patients were included in the primary analysis (placebo, n=133; sorafenib, n=134). With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 35.5-38.1), median event-free survival was 9 months (95% CI 4-15) in the placebo group versus 21 months (9-32) in the sorafenib group, corresponding to a 3-year event-free survival of 22% (95% CI 13-32) in the placebo group versus 40% (29-51) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI; 0.45-0.91; p=0.013). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were fever (71 [53%] in the placebo group vs 73 [54%] in the sorafenib group), infections (55 [41%] vs 46 [34%]), pneumonia (21 [16%] vs 20 [14%]), and pain (13 [10%] vs 15 [11%]). Grade 3 or worse adverse events that were significantly more common in the sorafenib group than the placebo group were fever (relative risk [RR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.04-2.28), diarrhoea (RR 7.89, 2.94-25.2), bleeding (RR 3.75, 1.5-10.0), cardiac events (RR 3.46, 1.15-11.8), hand-foot-skin reaction (only in sorafenib group), and rash (RR 4.06, 1.25-15.7). INTERPRETATION: In patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger, the addition of sorafenib to standard chemotherapy has antileukaemic efficacy but also increased toxicity. Our findings suggest that kinase inhibitors could be a useful addition to curative treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival after long-term follow-up and strategies to reduce toxicity are needed to determine the future role of sorafenib in treatment of this disease.

Pegylated Escherichia coli asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) has a longer half-life and is potentially less immunogenic than the native Escherichia coli (E coli) preparation, and can be more feasibly administered intravenously. The aim of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Consortium Protocol 05-001 (DFCI 05-001) was to compare the relative toxicity and efficacy of intravenous PEG-asparaginase and intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: DFCI 05-001 enrolled patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia from 11 consortium sites in the USA and Canada. Patients were assigned to an initial risk group on the basis of their baseline characteristics and then underwent 32 days of induction therapy. Those who achieved complete remission after induction therapy were assigned to a final risk group and were eligible to participate in a randomised comparison of intravenous PEG-asparaginase (15 doses of 2500 IU/m(2) every 2 weeks) or intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase (30 doses of 25 000 IU/m(2) weekly), beginning at week 7 after study entry. Randomisation (1:1) was unmasked, and was done by a statistician-generated allocation sequence using a permuted blocks algorithm (block size of 4), stratified by final risk group. The primary endpoint of the randomised comparison was the overall frequency of asparaginase-related toxicities (defined as allergy, pancreatitis, and thrombotic or bleeding complications). Predefined secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, serum asparaginase activity, and quality of life during therapy as assessed by PedsQL surveys. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00400946. FINDINGS: Between April 22, 2005, and Feb 12, 2010, 551 eligible patients were enrolled. 526 patients achieved complete remission after induction, of whom 463 were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase (n=231) or intravenous PEG-asparaginase (n=232). The two treatment groups did not differ significantly in the overall frequency of asparaginase-related toxicities (65 [28%] of 232 patients in the intravenous PEG-asparaginase group vs 59 [26%] of 231 patients in the intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase group, p=0.60), or in the individual frequency of allergy (p=0.36), pancreatitis (p=0.55), or thrombotic or bleeding complications (p=0.26). Median follow-up was 6.0 years (IQR 5.0-7.1). 5-year disease-free survival was 90% (95% CI 86-94) for patients assigned to intravenous PEG-asparaginase and 89% (85-93) for those assigned to intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase (p=0.58). The median nadir serum asparaginase activity was significantly higher in patients who received intravenous PEG-asparaginase than in those who received intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase. Significantly more anxiety was reported by both patients and parent-proxy in the intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase group than in the intravenous PEG-asparaginase group. Scores for other domains were similar between the groups. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were bacterial or fungal infections (47 [20%] of 232 in the intravenous PEG-asparaginase group vs 51 [22%] of 231 patients in the intramuscular E colil-asparaginase group) and asparaginase-related allergic reactions (14 [6%] vs 6 [3%]). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous PEG-asparaginase was not more toxic than, was similarly efficacious to, and was associated with decreased anxiety compared with intramuscular native E colil-asparaginase, supporting its use as the front-line asparaginase preparation in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

T-cell homeostasis is maintained by clonal competition for trophic niches (survival signals stimulated through interactions with self-antigens bound to major histocompatibility molecules), where a clone is defined as the set of T cells carrying the same antigen specific T-cell receptor (TCR). We analytically derive fitness functions of healthy and leukemic clone variants, respectively, that capture the dependency of the stability of the healthy T-cell pool against leukemic invaders on clonal diversity and kinetic parameters. Similar to the stability of ecosystems with high biodiversity, leukemic mutants are suppressed within polyclonal T-cell populations, i.e., in the presence of a huge number of different TCRs. To the contrary, for a low clonal diversity the leukemic clone variants are able to invade the healthy T-cell pool. The model, therefore, describes the experimentally observed phenomenon that preleukemic clone variants prevail in quasi-monoclonal experimental settings (in mice), whereas in polyclonal settings the healthy TCR variants are able to suppress the outgrowth of tumours. Between the two extremal situations of mono- and polyclonality there exists a range of coexistence of healthy and oncogenic clone variants with moderate fitness (stability) each. A variation of cell cycle times considerably changes the dynamics within this coexistence region. Faster proliferating variants increase their chance to dominate. Finally, a simplified niche variation scheme illustrates a possible mechanism to increase clonal T-cell diversity given a small niche diversity.","['Diebner, Hans H', 'Kirberg, Jorg', 'Roeder, Ingo']","['Diebner HH', 'Kirberg J', 'Roeder I']","['Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Fetscherstrasse 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.

GTPase-impairing somatic mutations in RAS genes, such as KRAS(G12D), are among the most common oncogenic events in metastatic cancer. A different type of cancer Ras signal, driven by overexpression of the RasGEF RasGRP1 (Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 1), was recently implicated in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients and murine models, in which RasGRP1 T-ALLs expand in response to treatment with interleukins (ILs) 2, 7 and 9. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2/7/9 stimulation activates Erk and Akt pathways downstream of Ras in RasGRP1 T-ALL but not in normal thymocytes. In normal lymphocytes, RasGRP1 is recruited to the membrane by diacylglycerol (DAG) in a phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma)-dependent manner. Surprisingly, we find that leukemic RasGRP1-triggered Ras-Akt signals do not depend on acute activation of PLCgamma to generate DAG but rely on baseline DAG levels instead. In agreement, using three distinct assays that measure different aspects of the RasGTP/GDP cycle, we established that overexpression of RasGRP1 in T-ALLs results in a constitutively high GTP-loading rate of Ras, which is constantly counterbalanced by hydrolysis of RasGTP. KRAS(G12D) T-ALLs do not show constitutive GTP loading of Ras.

Although typically considered as having tumour-suppressive properties, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling is altered during cancer and has been associated with the invasion of cancer cells and metastasis. In this study, we report a previously unknown role for the cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukaemia (cPML) tumour suppressor in TGF-beta signalling-induced regulation of prostate cancer-associated EMT and invasion. We demonstrate that cPML promotes a mesenchymal phenotype and increases the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of TGF-beta canonical signalling pathway through the induction of Sma and Mad related family 2 and 3 (SMAD2 and SMAD3) phosphorylation. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic localization of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) is mediated by its nuclear export in a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner. This was clinically tested in prostate cancer tissue and shown that cytoplasmic PML and CRM1 co-expression correlates with reduced disease-specific survival. In summary, we provide evidence of dysfunctional TGF-beta signalling occurring at an early stage in prostate cancer. We show that this disease pathway is mediated by cPML and CRM1 and results in a more aggressive cancer cell phenotype. We propose that the targeting of this pathway could be therapeutically exploited for clinical benefit.","['Buczek, M E', 'Miles, A K', 'Green, W', 'Johnson, C', 'Boocock, D J', 'Pockley, A G', 'Rees, R C', 'Hulman, G', 'van Schalkwyk, G', 'Parkinson, R', 'Hulman, J', 'Powe, D G', 'Regad, T']","['Buczek ME', 'Miles AK', 'Green W', 'Johnson C', 'Boocock DJ', 'Pockley AG', 'Rees RC', 'Hulman G', 'van Schalkwyk G', 'Parkinson R', 'Hulman J', 'Powe DG', 'Regad T']","['John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Urology, City Hospital, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', ""Department of Cellular Pathology, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, Nottingham, UK."", 'Department of Histopathology, Royal Derby Hospital, Derby, UK.', 'Department of Urology, City Hospital, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.', ""Department of Cellular Pathology, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, Nottingham, UK."", 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.', ""Department of Cellular Pathology, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, Nottingham, UK."", 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane, Nottingham, UK.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151109,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyopherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad2 Protein/metabolism', 'Smad3 Protein/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2015/11/10 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2015/11/10 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2015409 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.409 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Jun 30;35(26):3465-75. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.409.

However, their underlying mechanisms in CML remain unclear. In the present study, three regulatory networks of genes and miRs were constructed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of CML. The first network was the experimentally validated network of miRs and genes. The second was the dysregulatory network of CML, consisting of dysregulated genes and miRs, contributing to the pathogenesis of CML. The third was the CMLassociated network, consisting of CMLassociated genes and miRs. In addition to dysregulated genes and miRs, the associated network includes nondysregulated genes and miRs that contribute to prevention, diagnosis, metastasis and therapy of CML. Key pathways were extracted and compared to distinguish the similarities and differences between dysregulatory nodes among the three networks. V-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog and miR155 were observed to form a feedback loop module in the dysregulatory network. Regulation of the dysregulatory network may present as a strategy for gene therapy of CML. The current study provides an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of, and a potential treatment strategy for, CML.","['Wang, Kunhao', 'Xu, Zhiwen', 'Wang, Ning', 'Tian, Ye', 'Sun, Xin', 'Ma, Yonggang']","['Wang K', 'Xu Z', 'Wang N', 'Tian Y', 'Sun X', 'Ma Y']","['School of Information Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, Jilin 130600, P.R.

Yet pharmacological inhibition of RAD52, which binds single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and lacks enzymatic activity, has not been demonstrated. Here, we identify the small molecule 6-hydroxy-DL-dopa (6-OH-dopa) as a major allosteric inhibitor of the RAD52 ssDNA binding domain. For example, we find that multiple small molecules bind to and completely transform RAD52 undecamer rings into dimers, which abolishes the ssDNA binding channel observed in crystal structures. 6-OH-Dopa also disrupts RAD52 heptamer and undecamer ring superstructures, and suppresses RAD52 recruitment and recombination activity in cells with negligible effects on other double-strand break repair pathways. Importantly, we show that 6-OH-dopa selectively inhibits the proliferation of BRCA-deficient cancer cells, including those obtained from leukemia patients. Taken together, these data demonstrate small-molecule disruption of RAD52 rings as a promising mechanism for precision medicine in BRCA-deficient cancers.","['Chandramouly, Gurushankar', 'McDevitt, Shane', 'Sullivan, Katherine', 'Kent, Tatiana', 'Luz, Antonio', 'Glickman, J Fraser', 'Andrake, Mark', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Pomerantz, Richard T']","['Chandramouly G', 'McDevitt S', 'Sullivan K', 'Kent T', 'Luz A', 'Glickman JF', 'Andrake M', 'Skorski T', 'Pomerantz RT']","['Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'High-Throughput and Spectroscopy Resource Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'High-Throughput and Spectroscopy Resource Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple Health, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with acute leukemia were enrolled for determination of mRNA STC1 by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis and at day 28. RESULTS: Median STC1 gene expression was 16.2 and 4.43 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 9.67 and 2.37 in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on days 0 and 28, respectively. A cutoff level for STC1 gene expression was established subdividing patients into high- and low-STC1 gene expression groups. Median STC1 gene expression at days 0 and 28 was significantly higher among patients who were nonresponders to therapy than among those who were therapy responders in both groups. Patients achieving complete remission had significantly lower baseline STC1 gene expression than those in relapse. High STC1 gene expression was associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival times. CONCLUSION: STC1 gene expression at diagnosis might be a useful prognostic marker for clinical outcome and monitoring therapeutic response in patients with acute leukemia.","['Abaza, H M H', 'Elmougy, M I', 'El Maraghy, H M A', 'Mahmoud, H M']","['Abaza HM', 'Elmougy MI', 'El Maraghy HM', 'Mahmoud HM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151107,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '76687-96-2 (teleocalcin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/09 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/09 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12445 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Feb;38(1):81-9. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12445.

Src homology-2 (SH2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. Transcriptional silencing of SHP-1 plays a critical role in the development and progression of cancers through STAT3 activation. 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that causes DNA demethylation resulting in re-expression of silenced SHP-1. Lestaurtinib (CEP-701) is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits FLT3 tyrosine kinase and induces hematological remission in AML patients harboring the internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD). However, the majority of patients in clinical trials developed resistance to CEP-701. Therefore, the aim of this study, was to assess the effect of re-expression of SHP-1 on sensitivity to CEP-701 in resistant AML cells. METHODS: Resistant cells harboring the FLT3-ITD were developed by overexposure of MV4-11 to CEP-701, and the effects of 5-Aza treatment were investigated. Apoptosis and cytotoxicity of CEP-701 were determined using Annexin V and MTS assays, respectively. Gene expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. STATs activity was examined by western blotting and the methylation profile of SHP-1 was studied using MS-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The cytotoxic dose of CEP-701 on resistant cells was significantly higher in comparison with parental and MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells (p = 0.004). The resistant cells showed a significant higher viability and lower apoptosis compared with other cells (p < 0.001). Expression of SHP-1 was 7-fold higher in MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells compared to parental and resistant cells (p = 0.011). STAT3 was activated in resistant cells. Methylation of SHP-1 was significantly decreased in MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The restoration of SHP-1 expression induces sensitivity towards CEP-701 and could serve as a target in the treatment of AML. Our findings support the hypothesis that, the tumor-suppressor effect of SHP-1 is lost due to epigenetic silencing and its re-expression might play an important role in re-inducing sensitivity to TKIs. Thus, SHP-1 is a plausible candidate for a role in the development of CEP-701 resistance in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients.","['Al-Jamal, Hamid Ali Nagi', 'Mat Jusoh, Siti Asmaa', 'Hassan, Rosline', 'Johan, Muhammad Farid']","['Al-Jamal HA', 'Mat Jusoh SA', 'Hassan R', 'Johan MF']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. aljamalhamid08@gmail.com.', 'Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. asma_sof88@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. roslin@usm.my.', 'Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. faridjohan@usm.my.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151107,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Furans', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2015/11/10 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2015/11/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1695-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1695-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Nov 7;15:869. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1695-x.,,PMC4637135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geographical regions were classified according to the United Nations World Macro Regions and Components. Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (ASR) were adjusted to the World Standard Population. Poisson regression was used to assess age-specific interactions. 57.2% were male among 33,690 diagnoses. Median age at diagnosis was lowest in Africa and Asia (47 years) and highest in Oceania (72 years). ASR was lowest in African males (0.61 per 100,000) and Asian females (0.55 per 100,000) and highest in Oceania males and females (1.78 and 0.96 per 100,000, respectively). A significant interaction (p < 0.0001) between age (<50 years and >50 years) and region exists; no significant differences were seen by region in the <50 age-group while significant differences by region exist in the >50 age group.

This problem is aggravated by the fact that multiple rather than single mechanisms are involved in resistance and that multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomena cause inefficacy of many clinical established anticancer drugs. We are seeking for novel cytotoxic phytochemicals to combat drug-resistant tumour cells. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of three naturally occurring flavonoids including two flavones artocarpesin (1) and cycloartocarpesin (2) and one chalcone, isobavachalcone (3) against 9 drug-sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines. The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these compounds, whilst caspase-Glo assay was used to detect caspase activation. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were all analysed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flavones 1 and 2 as well as chalcone 3 displayed cytotoxic effects at various extent on all the 9 tested cancer cell lines with IC50 values respectively below 106 microM, 50 microM and 25 microM. The IC50 values for the three investigational flavonoids ranged from 23.95 microM (towards hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells) to 105 microM [towards colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells] for 1, from 15.51 microM (towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 49.83 microM [towards glioblastoma U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells] for 2 and from 2.30 microM (towards CCRF-CEM cells) to 23.80 microM [towards colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53(+/+)) cells] for 3 and from 0.20 microM (towards CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 microM (towards leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. Compounds 2 and 3 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells, mediated by caspase activation and the disruption of MMP. CONCLUSIONS: The three tested flavonoids and mostly chalcone 3 are potential cytotoxic natural products that deserve more investigations to develop novel antineoplastic drugs against multifactorial drug-resistant cancers.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Zeino, Maen', 'Fozing, Christian D', 'Ngameni, Bathelemy', 'Kapche, Gilbert Deccaux W F', 'Ngadjui, Bonaventure T', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Mbaveng AT', 'Zeino M', 'Fozing CD', 'Ngameni B', 'Kapche GD', 'Ngadjui BT', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', ""Department of Chemistry, Higher Teachers' Training College, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon."", 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.

A number of phenotypic driver (JAK2, CALR, MPL) and additional subclonal mutations have been described in PMF, pointing to a complex genomic landscape. To discover novel genomic lesions that can contribute to disease phenotype and/or development, gene expression and copy number signals were integrated and several genomic abnormalities leading to a concordant alteration in gene expression levels were identified. In particular, copy number gain in the polyamine oxidase (PAOX) gene locus was accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional up-regulation in PMF patients. PAOX inhibition resulted in rapid cell death of PMF progenitor cells, while sparing normal cells, suggesting that PAOX inhibition could represent a therapeutic strategy to selectively target PMF cells without affecting normal hematopoietic cells' survival. Moreover, copy number loss in the chromatin modifier HMGXB4 gene correlates with a concomitant transcriptional down-regulation in PMF patients. Interestingly, silencing of HMGXB4 induces megakaryocyte differentiation, while inhibiting erythroid development, in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

However, drug resistance is a primary hindrance to curative chemotherapy in leukemia and its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have recently shown that impaired folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) splicing possibly contributes to the loss of FPGS activity in MTX-resistant leukemia cell line models and adult leukemia patients. However, no information is available on the possible splicing alterations in FPGS in pediatric ALL. Here, using a comprehensive PCR-based screen we discovered and characterized a spectrum of FPGS splicing alterations including exon skipping and intron retention, all of which proved to frequently emerge in both pediatric and adult leukemia patient specimens. Furthermore, an FPGS activity assay revealed that these splicing alterations resulted in loss of FPGS function. Strikingly, pulse-exposure of leukemia cells to antifolates and other chemotherapeutics markedly enhanced the prevalence of several FPGS splicing alterations in antifolate-resistant cells, but not in their parental antifolate-sensitive counterparts. These novel findings suggest that an assortment of deleterious FPGS splicing alterations may constitute a mechanism of antifolate resistance in childhood ALL. Our findings have important implications for the rational overcoming of drug resistance in individual leukemia patients.","['Wojtuszkiewicz, Anna', 'Raz, Shachar', 'Stark, Michal', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Wojtuszkiewicz A', 'Raz S', 'Stark M', 'Assaraf YG', 'Jansen G', 'Peters GJ', 'Sonneveld E', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department Of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department Of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department Of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department Of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department Of Rheumatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department Of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department Of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151125,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Peptide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2015/11/09 06:00,2016/06/10 06:00,['2015/11/09 06:00'],"['2015/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29919 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Apr 1;138(7):1645-56. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29919.

The prognosis of patients with aggressive ATL remains poor because ATL cells acquire resistance to conventional cytotoxic agents. Therefore, development of novel agents is urgently needed. We examined the effects of YM155, sepantronium bromide, on cell proliferation and survival of ATL or HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, S1T, MT-1, and MT-2. We found that YM155 suppressed cell proliferation in these cells and induced cell death in S1T and MT-1 cells. Both real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses showed suppression of survivin expression in S1T, MT-1, and MT-2 cells. In addition, we observed the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in YM155-treated S1T and MT-1 cells, indicating that YM155 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in these cells. To clarify the mechanism of drug tolerance of MT-2 cells in terms of YM155-induced cell death, we examined intracellular signaling status in these cells. We found that STAT3, STAT5, and AKT were constitutively phosphorylated in MT-2 cells but not in S1T and MT-1 cells. Treatment with YM155 combined with the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 significantly suppressed cell proliferation compared to that with either YM155 or S3I-201 in MT-2 cells, indicating that STAT3 may play a role in tolerance of MT-2 cells to YM155 and that STAT3 may therefore be a therapeutic target for YM155-resistant ATL cells. These results suggest that YM155 presents potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects via suppression of survivin in ATL cells in which STAT3 is not constitutively phosphorylated. YM155 merits further investigation as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for ATL.","['Sasaki, Ryousei', 'Ito, Shigeki', 'Asahi, Maki', 'Ishida, Yoji']","['Sasaki R', 'Ito S', 'Asahi M', 'Ishida Y']","['Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Morioka, Iwate 020-8505, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Morioka, Iwate 020-8505, Japan.

RESULTS: We detected FLT3-ITD and/or RAS mutations in twenty-seven (26%) patients at the time of transformation to AML. Twenty-two patients (81%) had RAS mutations and five (19%) had FLT3-ITD mutations. The median survival after leukemia transformation in patients who had detectable RAS and/or FLT3-ITD mutations was 2.4 months compared to 7.5 months in patients who retained wt RAS and FLT3-ITD (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-5.0, p<0.0001).

Although some in vitro methods assessing DILI risk that utilize hepatic cell death or cellular stress as markers have been developed, the predictive ability of these tests is low. In this study, we sought to develop a novel cell-based assay for the risk assessment of DILI that considers drug metabolism as well as immune- and inflammatory-related gene expression. To accomplish this goal, human hepatoma HepaRG or HepG2 cells were treated with 96 drugs with different clinical DILI risks. The conditioned media were subsequently used to treat human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, and the mRNA expression levels of immune- and inflammatory-related genes in the cells were measured. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was calculated to evaluate the predictive performance of the mRNA levels as markers to discriminate DILI risk. The expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in HL-60 cells treated with conditioned media from HepaRG cells (HL-60/HepaRG) exhibited the highest ROC-AUC value of 0.758, followed by the expression of IL-1beta in HL-60/HepaRG (ROC-AUC: 0.726). Notably, the ROC-AUC values of these genes were higher in HL-60/HepaRG than in HL-60/HepG2, which suggests that HL-60/HepaRG has a higher potential for detecting the metabolic activation of drugs.

Our previous studies showed that oligonucleotide-treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells compensate for diminished expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), an apoptosis inhibitor, by suppressing the expression of caspase-3 (an apoptosis promoter) while enhancing that of serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT1) (another apoptosis inhibitor). In addition, we found an enhanced expression of the androgen receptor (AR), its p300 and interleukin-6 (IL6) co-activators, polymerase transcription mediator (MED12), and growth-regulating signal transducer (STAT3). The net result was an altered pattern of gene expression often associated with more aggressive and proliferative tumors. To further evaluate adaptive compensatory mechanisms related to tumor resistance, aggression and proliferation, herein we evaluated the level of expression of a proliferation antigen (KI-67) and mitosis-regulating cyclins (B1 and D1). Compared to the relative levels of compensation detailed above, we found the expression of KI-67 to be statistically the most enhanced non-targeted protein yet identified in compensation for suppression of BCL2. Expression of cyclin D1 was also significantly enhanced, although to a much lesser extent. As a result, we propose that oligonucleotide-mediated treatment could be more effective when directed towards KI-67 and BCL2. This could be accomplished by dual monospecific targeting KI-67 and BCL2, or with a bispecific (or proposed multispecific) oligonucleotide simultaneously targeting both.","['Rubenstein, Marvin', 'Hollowell, Courtney M P', 'Guinan, Patrick']","['Rubenstein M', 'Hollowell CM', 'Guinan P']","['Division of Cellular Biology, Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.

Recently, it was hypothesized that efflux properties might facilitate the efflux of accumulated chemotherapeutic drugs and as such constitute a tumor escape mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As SP characterization in leukemia is incomplete, we characterized SP frequencies in 19 children diagnosed with acute B cell precursor leukemia (BCP-ALL), AML and T-ALL and described engraftment properties in immune-compromised NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)IL2rg(tmWjl)/Sz (NSG) mice. RESULTS: SP cells are detectable in children and mice irrespective of the origin of the leukemia and flow-cytometric analysis reveals that the SP population is a distinct sub-population. Functionally, the SP size remains stable over serial transplantations indicating that the ""stemness"" potential of our SP sample cohort was overall low. CONCLUSION: SP cells exist in pediatric leukemia and are maintainable in NSG mice. Thus, our observations may facilitate down-stream characterization of LSCs in future studies.","['Andre, Maya C', 'Witte, Kai-Erik', 'Hoerrmann, Reinhard A', 'Schmitt, Anja', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Ebinger, Martin']","['Andre MC', 'Witte KE', 'Hoerrmann RA', 'Schmitt A', 'Handgretinger R', 'Ebinger M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, University Children's Hospital, Basel, Switzerland maya.andre@med.uni-tuebingen.de."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Benzimidazoles', 'Cell Tracking/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Side-Population Cells/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/08 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['29/6/661 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2015 Nov-Dec;29(6):661-9.,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloic leukemia', 'Leukemic stem cells', 'NSG mice', 'acute B cell precursor leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'side population']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early adverse events may be detrimental in adulthood. Protective factors present during gestation could significantly impact post-natal therapy. The role of PreImplantation Factor (PIF) within this context is herein examined. Secreted by viable early embryos, PIF establishes effective embryonic-maternal communication and exerts essential trophic and protective roles by reducing oxidative stress and protein misfolding and by blunting the nocive let-7 microRNA related pathway. PIF's effects on systemic immunity lead to comprehensive immune modulation, not immune suppression. We examine PIF's role in protecting embryos from adverse maternal environment, which can lead to neurological disorders that may only manifest post-nataly: Synthetic PIF successfully translates endogenous PIF features in both pregnant and non-pregnant clinically relevant models. Specifically PIF has neuroprotective effects in neonatal prematurity. In adult relapsing-remitting neuroinflammation, PIF reverses advanced paralysis while promoting neurogenesis. PIF reversed Mycobacterium smegmatis induced brain infection. In graft-vs.-host disease, PIF reduced skin ulceration, liver inflammation and colon ulceration while maintaining beneficial anti-cancer, graft-vs.-leukemia effect. Clinical-grade PIF has high-safety profile even at supraphysiological doses. The FDA awarded Fast-Track designation, and university-sponsored clinical trials for autoimmune disorder are ongoing. Altogether, PIF properties point to its determining regulatory role in immunity, inflammation and transplant acceptance. Specific plans for using PIF for the treatment of complex neurological disorders (ie. traumatic brain injury, progressive paralysis), including neuroprotection from newborn to adult, are presented.","['Barnea, E R', 'Almogi-Hazan, O', 'Or, R', 'Mueller, M', 'Ria, F', 'Weiss, L', 'Paidas, M J']","['Barnea ER', 'Almogi-Hazan O', 'Or R', 'Mueller M', 'Ria F', 'Weiss L', 'Paidas MJ']","['The Society for the Investigation of Early Pregnancy (SIEP), Cherry Hill, NJ, USA; BioIncept LLC, Cherry Hill, NJ, USA.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacogenetic screening is warranted for better management of imatinib therapy. The present study was framed to explore the influence of common drug transporter gene polymorphisms of ABCB1, ABCG2, OCT1 and trough level concentration on commonly occurring adverse events in CML patients treated with imatinib mesylate. METHODS: A total number of 111 patients in chronic phase (Philadelphia chromosome +ve) were included in the study. The plasma drug concentration of imatinib was estimated using LC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD trough level concentration of imatinib mesylate was found to be 1430.7 +/- 438.7 ng/ml. The trough level concentration at steady state (Cmin.ss) was significantly higher in patients with grade 2-4 thrombocytopenia compared with patients without the adverse event (P value 0.033). CONCLUSION: The drug level of imatinib in plasma correlates with the severity of thrombocytopenia, which adds to the utility of TDM in the management of CML patients.","['Francis, Jose', 'Dubashi, Biswajit', 'Sundaram, Rajan', 'Pradhan, Suresh Chandra', 'Chandrasekaran, Adithan']","['Francis J', 'Dubashi B', 'Sundaram R', 'Pradhan SC', 'Chandrasekaran A']","['Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India. drbiswajitdm@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/08 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00280-015-2905-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-015-2905-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Dec;76(6):1185-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2905-6.

A sample of 174 CML patients aged 60 years or above was analyzed. HRQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). A number of pre-selected sociodemographic and disease-related factors were considered as potential confounding factors for the association between comorbidity and HRQOL. Mean age of the 174 patients analyzed was 70 years (range 60-87 years) and 55 % were male. Overall, 111 patients (64 %) reported at least one comorbidity. Analysis stratified by age group category showed a greater proportion of patients with comorbidities in the older sub-group population (>/=70 years) compared to younger patients (60 to 69 years). Differences in HRQOL outcomes between patients with no comorbidity at all and those with two or more comorbid conditions were at least twice the magnitude of a clinically meaningful difference in all the physical and mental health scales of the SF-36. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for key confounding factors, the following scales were significantly lower in those with comorbidity: general health (p < 0.001), bodily pain (p < 0.001), physical functioning (p = 0.002), and vitality (p = 0.002). Assessing comorbidity in elderly patients with CML is important to facilitate identification of those most in need of HRQOL improvements.","['Efficace, F', 'Rosti, G', 'Breccia, M', 'Cottone, F', 'Giesinger, J M', 'Stagno, F', 'Iurlo, A', 'Russo Rossi, A', 'Luciano, L', 'Martino, B', 'Galimberti, S', 'Turri, D', 'Bergamaschi, M', 'Tiribelli, M', 'Fava, C', 'Angelucci, E', 'Mandelli, F', 'Baccarani, M']","['Efficace F', 'Rosti G', 'Breccia M', 'Cottone F', 'Giesinger JM', 'Stagno F', 'Iurlo A', 'Russo Rossi A', 'Luciano L', 'Martino B', 'Galimberti S', 'Turri D', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Tiribelli M', 'Fava C', 'Angelucci E', 'Mandelli F', 'Baccarani M']","['Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), GIMEMA Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Via Benevento, 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. f.efficace@gimema.it.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, S.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), known to modulate gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms, were implicated in regulation of early pregnancy events including maternal recognition of pregnancy and implantation. To characterize complex transcriptomic changes, expression of miRNAs in pregnant and cyclic endometria collected on days 12, 16 and 20 was analyzed using Illumina deep sequencing and analyzed with bioinformatic pipeline. Moreover, expression profiles of ten genes related to miRNA synthesis and transport such as DROSHA, DGCR8, XPO5, DICER, TARBP2, TNRC6A, and AGO1-4 were determined. RESULTS: Among genes involved in miRNA transport and synthesis DROSHA, XPO5, DICER1, TARBP, and AGO1 expression was affected by the reproductive status. Moreover, DICER1 and AGO2 proteins were localized in luminal and glandular epithelium with immunofluorescence staining. Several hundred mature, canonical and non-canonical miRNAs were found to be expressed in the endometrial samples. Detailed analysis revealed that miRNA length variants, isomiRs, accounted for the vast majority of defined sequences. Both miRNA and isomiR of miR-140-3p were shown to affect expression of putative targets in endometrial stromal cells in vitro. Computational analysis of putative target genes for miRNAs differentially expressed (DE) between pregnant and cyclic animals resulted in lists of biological processes and regulatory pathways indicating their role in cellular development, cell cycle, immunological response and organismal development. Among predicted target genes for DE miRNAs, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), progesterone and estradiol receptors (PGR, ESR1) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were found. CONCLUSIONS: This research revealed a repertoire of pregnancy-related miRNAs in porcine endometrium during initial stages of conceptus implantation and during the estrous cycle, and sheds light on mechanisms regulating miRNA-mediated gene expression at the maternal-conceptus interface.","['Krawczynski, Kamil', 'Bauersachs, Stefan', 'Reliszko, Zaneta P', 'Graf, Alexander', 'Kaczmarek, Monika M']","['Krawczynski K', 'Bauersachs S', 'Reliszko ZP', 'Graf A', 'Kaczmarek MM']","['Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research Polish Academy of Sciences (IARFR PAS), Tuwima 10, 10-748, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis (LAFUGA), LMU University of Munich, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 25, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'Present address: Department of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Zurich, Animal Physiology, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Universitaetstrasse 2, Zurich, 8092, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research Polish Academy of Sciences (IARFR PAS), Tuwima 10, 10-748, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis (LAFUGA), LMU University of Munich, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 25, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research Polish Academy of Sciences (IARFR PAS), Tuwima 10, 10-748, Olsztyn, Poland. m.kaczmarek@pan.olsztyn.pl.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2015/11/08 06:00,2016/07/19 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-015-2172-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-015-2172-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2015 Nov 6;16:906. doi: 10.1186/s12864-015-2172-2.,,PMC4636777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the genome-wide interplay between AML1/ETO and wild-type AML1 remains elusive in the leukemogenesis of t(8;21) AML. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and computational analysis, followed by a series of experimental validations, we report here that wild-type AML1 is able to orchestrate the expression of AML1/ETO targets regardless of being activated or repressed; this is achieved via forming a complex with AML1/ETO and via recruiting the cofactor AP-1 on chromatin. On chromatin occupancy, AML1/ETO and wild-type AML1 largely overlap and preferentially bind to adjacent and distinct short and long AML1 motifs on the colocalized regions, respectively. On physical interaction, AML1/ETO can form a complex with wild-type AML1 on chromatin, and the runt homology domain of both proteins are responsible for their interactions. More importantly, the relative binding signals of AML1 and AML1/ETO on chromatin determine which genes are repressed or activated by AML1/ETO. Further analysis of coregulators indicates that AML1/ETO transactivates gene expression through recruiting AP-1 to the AML1/ETO-AML1 complex. These findings enrich our knowledge of understanding the significance of the interplay between the wild-type protein and the oncogenic fusion protein in the development of leukemia.","['Li, Yizhen', 'Wang, Huanwei', 'Wang, Xiaoling', 'Jin, Wen', 'Tan, Yun', 'Fang, Hai', 'Chen, Saijuan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Wang, Kankan']","['Li Y', 'Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Jin W', 'Tan Y', 'Fang H', 'Chen S', 'Chen Z', 'Wang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; and Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; and Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)']",IM,"['Chromatin/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2015/11/08 06:00,2016/06/06 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30562-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-03-626671 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 14;127(2):233-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-03-626671.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Reductions of thyroid gland volume below 2 standard deviations of the weight-specific mean value, occurrence of ultrasonographically detectable thyroid gland pathologies, and hypothyroidism were retrospectively assessed in 103 children and adolescents 7 months to 20 years of age (median: 7 years of age) at baseline (1997-2013) treated with chemoradiation therapy (with the thyroid gland dose assessable) or with chemotherapy alone and followed by ultrasonography and laboratory examinations through 2014 (median follow-up time: 48 months). RESULTS: A relevant reduction of thyroid gland volume was significantly correlated with thyroid gland dose in univariate (P<.001) and multivariate analyses for doses above 2 Gy. Odds ratios were 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-9.2; P=.046) for medium doses (2-25 Gy) and 14.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-160; P=.027) for high doses (>25 Gy). Thyroid gland dose was significantly higher in patients with thyroid gland pathologies during follow-up (P=.03). Univariate analysis revealed significant correlations between hypothyroidism and thyroid gland dose (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonographically detectable changes, that is, volume reductions, pathologies, and hypothyroidism, after malignancy treatment during childhood are associated with thyroid gland dose. Both ultrasonography and laboratory follow-up examinations should be performed regularly after tumor therapy during childhood, especially if the treatment included radiation therapy.","['Lollert, Andre', 'Gies, Christina', 'Laudemann, Katharina', 'Faber, Jorg', 'Jacob-Heutmann, Dorothee', 'Konig, Jochem', 'Duber, Christoph', 'Staatz, Gundula']","['Lollert A', 'Gies C', 'Laudemann K', 'Faber J', 'Jacob-Heutmann D', 'Konig J', 'Duber C', 'Staatz G']","['Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Section of Pediatric Radiology, Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.

We investigated whether miR-362-5p act as an oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and aimed to understand its potential underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We compared the miR-362-5p expression levels between CML and non-CML cell lines, and between fresh blood samples from CML patients and normal healthy controls using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin V-FITC/PI analyses were used to measure the effects of miR-362-5p on proliferation and apoptosis, and Transwell assays were used to evaluate migration and invasion. A xenograft model was used to examine in vivo tumourigenicity. The potential target of miR-362-5p was confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay, qPCR and western blotting. Involvement of the JNK1/2 and P38 pathways was investigated by western blotting. RESULTS: miR-362-5p was up-regulated in CML cell lines and fresh blood samples from CML patients, and was associated with Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (GADD)45alpha down-regulation. Inhibition of miR-362-5p simultaneously repressed tumour growth and up-regulated GADD45alpha expression in a xenograft model. Consistently, the knockdown of GADD45alpha expression partially neutralized the effects of miR-362-5p inhibition. Furthermore study suggested that GADD45alpha mediated downstream the effects of miR-362-5p, which might indirectly regulates the activation of the JNK1/2 and P38 signalling pathways. CONCLUSION: miR-362-5p acts as an oncomiR that down-regulates GADD45alpha, which consequently activates the JNK1/2 and P38 signalling. This finding provides novel insights into CML leukaemogenesis and may help identify new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.","['Yang, Peng', 'Ni, Fang', 'Deng, Rui-Qing', 'Qiang, Guo', 'Zhao, Hua', 'Yang, Ming-Zhen', 'Wang, Xin-Yi', 'Xu, You-Zhi', 'Chen, Li', 'Chen, Dan-Lei', 'Chen, Zhi-Jun', 'Kan, Li-Xin', 'Wang, Si-Ying']","['Yang P', 'Ni F', 'Deng RQ', 'Qiang G', 'Zhao H', 'Yang MZ', 'Wang XY', 'Xu YZ', 'Chen L', 'Chen DL', 'Chen ZJ', 'Kan LX', 'Wang SY']","['Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. yangpeng00812@163.com.', 'Department of Transfusion, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, PR China. yangpeng00812@163.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. nifang1203@126.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 443703883@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 414235163@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. bananazh.ivy@163.com.', 'Department of Haematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, PR China. yangmz89@163.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 409416935@qq.com.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 409416935@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. youzhixu08@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 23864775@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 869663530@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 269884236@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. 2816393992@qq.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, 81 MeiShan Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230032, PR China. sywang@ahmu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (MIRN361 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2015/11/08 06:00,2016/07/14 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-015-0465-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-015-0465-3 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Nov 6;14:190. doi: 10.1186/s12943-015-0465-3.,,PMC4636774,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gain of supernumerary copies of the 8q24 chromosomal region, which harbors MYC and PVT1, has been shown to be the most common secondary alteration in human APL. Increased MYC can accelerate the development of myeloid leukemia in APL. However, the role that the expression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PVT1 plays in the pathogenesis of APL remains largely unknown. FINDINGS: In this study, we first analyzed the lncRNA PVT1 expression level in peripheral blood cells from 28 patients with de novo APL, and significantly upregulated PVT1 was found in APL patients compared with healthy donors. We then observed significantly lower MYC and PVT1 expression during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest in the APL cell line. MYC knockdown in NB4 cells led to PVT1 downregulation. Moreover, PVT1 knockdown by RNA interference led to suppression of the MYC protein level, and cell proliferation was inhibited. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that the lncRNA PVT1 may play an important role in the proliferation of APL cells and may be useful for future therapeutic management.","['Zeng, Chengwu', 'Yu, Xibao', 'Lai, Jing', 'Yang, Lijiang', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zeng C', 'Yu X', 'Lai J', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Li Y']","['First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151106,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2015/11/08 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/11/08 06:00'],"['2015/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0223-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0223-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Nov 6;8:126. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0223-4.,,PMC4636781,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, mutations of this gene were also found in 3/3 high hypodiploid (40-44 chromosomes) cases, suggesting that the mutational patterns are similar in low hypodiploid and high hypodiploid ALL. The high hypodiploid ALLs frequently displayed substantial cell-to-cell variability in chromosomal content, indicative of chromosomal instability; a rare phenomenon in ALL. Gene expression analysis showed that genes on heterodisomic chromosomes were more highly expressed in hypodiploid cases. Cases clustered according to hypodiploid subtype in the unsupervised methylation analyses, but there was no association between chromosomal copy number and methylation levels. A comparison between samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse showed that the relapse did not arise from the major diagnostic clone in 3/4 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data support the conclusion that near-haploid and low hypodiploid ALL are different with regard to mutational profiles and also suggest that ALL cases with high hypodiploidy may harbor chromosomal instability.","['Safavi, Setareh', 'Olsson, Linda', 'Biloglav, Andrea', 'Veerla, Srinivas', 'Blendberg, Molly', 'Tayebwa, Johnbosco', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Castor, Anders', 'Hansson, Markus', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Paulsson, Kajsa']","['Safavi S', 'Olsson L', 'Biloglav A', 'Veerla S', 'Blendberg M', 'Tayebwa J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Castor A', 'Hansson M', 'Johansson B', 'Paulsson K']","['Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Region Skane, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Oncology and Pathology, Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Region Skane, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['6000 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6000 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 15;6(40):42793-802. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6000.,,PMC4767471,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chromosomal instability', 'hypodiploidy', 'next generation sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it was unknown whether and how Ras regulate DNA demethylation during carcinogenesis.

TDG recruited histone lysine demethylase JMJD3 to the Fas promoter and activated its expression, thus restoring sensitivity to apoptosis. TDG suppressed in vivo tumorigenicity of xenograft pancreatic cancer.

Treatment options are limited and targeted therapies are not available for MDS. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and the molecular mechanism of Homoharringtonine (HHT) and Bortezomib towards high-risk MDS cell line SKM-1 in vitro and the role of miR-3151 was first evaluated in SKM-1 cells. METHODS: SKM-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of HHT or Bortezomib, and cell viability was analyzed with CCK-8 assay. The influence on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and the percentage of apoptosis cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Calcusyn software was used to calculate combination index (CI) values. Western blot was used to analysis phosphorylation of Akt and nuclear NF-kappaB protein expression in SKM-1 cells. Mature miR-3151 level and p53 protein level were detected after HHT or Bortezomib treatment. The cell proliferation and p53 protein level were reassessed in SKM-1 cells infected with lentivirus to overexpress miR-3151. RESULTS: Simultaneous exposure to HHT and Bortezomib (10.4:1) resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation in SKM-1 cells (P < 0.05). Cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M phase was observed (P < 0.05). HHT and Bortezomib synergistically induced cell apoptosis by regulating members of caspase 9, caspase 3 and Bcl-2 family (P < 0.01). The mechanisms of the synergy involved Akt and NF-kappaB signaling pathway inhibition, downregulation of mature miR-3151 and increment of downstream p53 protein level. Overexpression of miR-3151 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited p53 protein expression in SKM-1 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: HHT and Bortezomib synergistically inhibit SKM-1 cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro. Inhibition of Akt and NF-kappaB pathway signaling contribute to molecular mechanism of HHT and Bortezomib. miR-3151 abundance is implicated in SKM-1 cell viability, cell proliferation and p53 protein expression.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Chen, Bobin', 'Wu, Ting', 'Wang, Qian', 'Zhuang, Lin', 'Zhu, Chen', 'Fan, Ni', 'Qing, Wenjiao', 'Ma, Yan', 'Xu, Xiaoping']","['Zhang J', 'Chen B', 'Wu T', 'Wang Q', 'Zhuang L', 'Zhu C', 'Fan N', 'Qing W', 'Ma Y', 'Xu X']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Software']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/06/22 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0142422 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-28213 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 6;10(11):e0142422. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142422. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4636319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspects of natural killer (NK) cell biology were analyzed before and during immunotherapy with focus on outcome in older patients. In younger (<60 years old, n = 37) and older patients (>60 years old, n = 47), treatment with HDC/IL-2 resulted in an expansion of CD56(bright) and CD16+ NK cells in blood along with an increased NK cell expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) NKp30 and NKp46. In older patients, a high expression of NKp30 or NKp46 on CD16+ NK cells before and during therapy predicted leukemia-free and overall survival. These results suggest that NK cell functions determine relapse risk and survival in older AML patients and point to biomarkers of efficacy in protocols for remission maintenance.","['Martner, Anna', 'Rydstrom, Anna', 'Riise, Rebecca E', 'Aurelius, Johan', 'Brune, Mats', 'Foa, Robin', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Thoren, Fredrik B']","['Martner A', 'Rydstrom A', 'Riise RE', 'Aurelius J', 'Brune M', 'Foa R', 'Hellstrand K', 'Thoren FB']","['TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 413 45, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 413 45, Sweden.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome 00161, Italy.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 405 30, Sweden.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase IV', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'M89N0Q7EQR (aldesleukin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD56 Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Histamine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['5559 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5559 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 15;6(40):42569-74. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5559.,,PMC4767453,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology and Microbiology Section', 'NKp30', 'NKp46', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment of AML consists of two treatment phases: the remission induction phase to achieve a rapid, complete remission (CR) and the consolidation phase to achieve a durable molecular remission. People in CR are at risk of AML relapse, and people with relapsed AML have poor survival prospects. Thus, there is a continuous need for treatments to further improve prognosis. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an immune-stimulatory cytokine, is an alternative to standard treatment for people with AML to maintain the efficacy after consolidation therapy. Maintenance therapy is not an integral part of the standard treatment for AML. Studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of IL-2 as maintenance therapy for people with AML in first CR, but the effect of IL-2 is not yet fully established. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IL-2 as maintenance therapy for children and adults with AML who have achieved first CR and have not relapsed. SEARCH METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2015), EMBASE (1950 to August 2015), LILACS (1982 to August 2015), CBM (1978 to August 2015), relevant conference proceedings (2000 to 2015), and metaRegister of Controlled Trials (since inception to August 2015) of ongoing and unpublished trials. In addition, we screened the reference lists of relevant trials and reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IL-2 with no treatment in people with AML who had achieved first CR and had not relapsed. We did not identify studies comparing IL-2 versus best supportive care or maintenance chemotherapy or studies comparing IL-2 plus maintenance chemotherapy versus maintenance chemotherapy alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data with a predefined extraction form, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We extracted data on the following outcomes: disease-free survival, overall survival, event-free survival, treatment-related mortality, adverse events, and quality of life. We measured the treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes and dichotomous outcomes with hazard ratio (HR) and risk ratio, respectively. We used inverse-variance method to combine HRs with fixed-effect model unless there was significant between-study heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with a total of 1665 participants, comparing IL-2 with no treatment. Six studies included adult participants, and three studies included both adults and children. However, the latter three studies did not report data for children, thus we were unable to conduct subgroup analysis of children. One Chinese study did not report any outcomes of interest for this review. We included six trials involving 1426 participants in the meta-analysis on disease-free survival, and included five trials involving 1355 participants in the meta-analysis on overall survival. There is no evidence for difference between IL-2 group and no-treatment group regarding disease-free survival (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, P = 0.37; quality of evidence: low) or overall survival (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.16, P = 0.35; quality of evidence: moderate). Based on one trial of 161 participants, IL-2 exerted no effect on event-free survival (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32, P = 0.88; quality of evidence: low). Adverse events (including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, malaise/fatigue, and infection/fever) were more frequent in participants receiving IL-2, according to one trial of 308 participants. No mortality due to adverse events was reported. None of the included studies reported treatment-related mortality or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for a difference between IL-2 maintenance therapy and no treatment with respect to disease-free survival or overall survival of people with AML in first CR; however, the quality of the evidence is moderate or low, and further research is likely or very likely to have an important impact on the estimate or our confidence in the estimate. Adverse events seem to be more frequent in participants treated with IL-2, but the quality of the evidence is very low and our confidence in the estimates is very uncertain. Thus, further prospective randomised trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn on these issues.","['Mao, Chen', 'Fu, Xiao-Hong', 'Yuan, Jin-Qiu', 'Yang, Zu-Yao', 'Huang, Ya-Fang', 'Ye, Qian-Ling', 'Wu, Xin-Yin', 'Hu, Xue-Feng', 'Zhai, Zhi-Min', 'Tang, Jin-Ling']","['Mao C', 'Fu XH', 'Yuan JQ', 'Yang ZY', 'Huang YF', 'Ye QL', 'Wu XY', 'Hu XF', 'Zhai ZM', 'Tang JL']","['Division of Epidemiology, The Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20151106,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*methods/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/03/31 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD010248.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Nov 6;(11):CD010248. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD010248.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative RNA splicing generates three main transcripts designated as Extra-long (XL; 5.9 kb/125 kD), Long (L; 3.8 kb/100 kD) and Short (S; 2.4 kb/35 kD). Our previous study results demonstrated that BCL11A expression levels were specifically upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues, especially in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and large cell carcinoma (LCC). METHODS: In this study, we detected the BCL11A protein isoforms with immunohistochemistry (IHC) method in NSCLC with in a cohort (n=40) of BCL11A overexpression NSCLC patients. All 40 cases were BCL11A overexpression including 27 SCCs, 8 LCCs and 5 adenocarcinomas (ACs). Relationship between BCL11A isoforms and the clinicopathological parameters were also analyzed. RESULTS: Compare to the BCL11A-L and S isoforms, the BCL11A-XL isoform was specifically expressed in SCC and LCC (P=0.006). There were 19 (19/40, 47.5%) cases positive for BCL11A-XL expression, SCC accounted for 63.2% (12/19) and LCC accounted for 36.8% (7/19). The survival analysis indicated that BCL11A-XL expression was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) [hazards ratio (HR) 0.246; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.065-0.939, P=0.040] but not for overall survival (OS) in patients with SCC and LCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the BCL11A-XL isoform might be a potential prognostic biomarker of SCC and LCC.","['Zhang, Na', 'Jiang, Ben-Yuan', 'Zhang, Xu-Chao', 'Xie, Zhi', 'Su, Jian', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Han, Jie-Fei', 'Tu, Hai-Yan', 'Wu, Yi-Long']","['Zhang N', 'Jiang BY', 'Zhang XC', 'Xie Z', 'Su J', 'Zhang Q', 'Han JF', 'Tu HY', 'Wu YL']","['1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '1 Southern Medical University, Graduate School, Guangzhou, China ; 2 Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute, Guangdong General Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,J Thorac Dis,Journal of thoracic disease,101533916,,,,2015/11/07 06:00,2015/11/07 06:01,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.09.39 [doi]', 'jtd-07-09-1630 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Dis. 2015 Sep;7(9):1630-6. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.09.39.,,PMC4598500,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11A-XL', 'non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Egypt, cladribine is mainly used as IV continuous infusion at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day for 7 days and as SC bolus injection at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg/day for 5 days. We aimed to compare the outcome and toxicity between these two regimens. We retrospectively collected data from HCL patients treated at the National Cancer Institute and its affiliated center, Nasser Institute, Cairo, Egypt. Forty-nine patients were identified, 18 treated with the IV regimen (IV group) and 31 with the SC regimen (SC group). Forty-one patients were newly diagnosed. Patient characteristics were balanced across the two groups. The CR rates in the IV and the SC group were 94% and 97%, respectively. The main complications in the IV group and the SC were neutropenia G3-4 (67% vs. 87%), mucositis mainly G1-2 (67% vs 32%) and infections (mainly viral, 78% vs 34%). In the IV group, five patients died, three of progression and infection, one of unknown cause and one of late heart failure. In the SC group, one patient died of disease progression and one of second cancer. After 33.5 months, median follow-up, the 3-year event free survival was 60% and 96%, respectively (p=0.104). The 3-year overall survival was 81% and 100%, respectively (p=0.277). In conclusion, SC cladribine is an excellent alternative to the IV regimen for the treatment of HCL.","['Khorshid, Ola', 'Namour, Alfred Elias', 'El-Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Mahmoud, Tarek Yakout', 'Fortpied, Catherine', 'Abdel-Malek, Raafat', 'Ramadan, Safaa']","['Khorshid O', 'Namour AE', 'El-Gammal MM', 'Mahmoud TY', 'Fortpied C', 'Abdel-Malek R', 'Ramadan S']","['National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Kasr Al-Ainy school of Medicine, Cairo University.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151016,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2015/11/07 06:00,2015/11/07 06:01,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2015.058 [doi]', 'mjhid-7-1-e2015058 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2015 Oct 16;7(1):e2015058. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2015.058. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4621169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The projection obtained (about 17,000 patients visited in the previous 12 months) is probably overestimated because of double-counting of patients who may have been treated at two different facilities during the year, although it is also underestimated since the internal medicine units were not involved. The balance of these two opposite factors is not known. It is important to bear in mind the approximation with which the count was performed in facilities for which no official data were available.

Our analysis showed 354 conserved motifs in the noncoding regions of HBG1 gene and 231 motifs in the HBG2 gene between the analyzed species. Of these motifs, 13 showed relation to Hb F regulation: cell division cycle-5 (CDC5), myelo-blastosis viral oncogene homolog (c-MYB), transcription factor CP2 (TFCP2), GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1), GATA binding protein 2 (GATA-2), nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2), nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX-1), T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL-1), YY1 transcription factor (YY1), beta protein 1 (BP1), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), and paired box 1 (PAX-1).

Despite the clinical and biological differences between these diseases, common pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified in MPN. First, aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling due to somatic mutations in certain driver genes is common to these MPN. Second, alterations of the bone marrow microenvironment are found in all MPN types and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the diseases. Finally, elevated levels of proinflammatory and microenvironment-regulating cytokines are commonly found in all MPN-variants. In this paper, we review the effects of MPN-related oncogenes on cytokine expression and release and describe common as well as distinct pathogenetic mechanisms underlying microenvironmental changes in various MPN. Furthermore, targeting of the microenvironment in MPN is discussed. Such novel therapies may enhance the efficacy and may overcome resistance to established tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in these patients. Nevertheless, additional basic studies on the complex interplay of neoplastic and stromal cells are required in order to optimize targeting strategies and to translate these concepts into clinical application.","['Hoermann, Gregor', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Valent, Peter']","['Hoermann G', 'Greiner G', 'Valent P']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria ; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151012,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Fibrosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/metabolism', '*Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/869242 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2015;2015:869242. doi: 10.1155/2015/869242.

However, the role of inflammation in the genesis of hematological malignancies has not been extensively studied. Recent evidence clearly shows that changes in the bone marrow niche can suffice to induce myeloid diseases. Nonetheless, while it has been demonstrated that myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are associated with a proinflammatory state, it is not clear whether inflammatory processes contribute to the induction or maintenance of MPN. More provocatively stated: which comes first, the hen or the egg, inflammation or MPN? In other words, can chronic inflammation itself trigger an MPN? In this review, we will describe the evidence supporting a role for inflammation in initiating and promoting MPN development. Furthermore, we will compare and contrast the data obtained in gastrointestinal tumors with observations in MPN patients and models, pointing out the opportunities provided by novel murine MPN models to address fundamental questions regarding the role of inflammatory stimuli in the molecular pathogenesis of MPN.","['Jutzi, Jonas S', 'Pahl, Heike L']","['Jutzi JS', 'Pahl HL']","['Division of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Freiburg, Center for Clinical Research, Breisacher Strasse 66, 79106 Freiburg, Germany ; Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), University of Freiburg, Albertstrasse 19A, 79104 Freiburg, Germany ; Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Schanzlestrasse 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Freiburg, Center for Clinical Research, Breisacher Strasse 66, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151012,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Inflammation/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*pathology']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/08/24 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/101987 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2015;2015:101987. doi: 10.1155/2015/101987.

RESULTS: Combined use of oaCGH analysis and karyotyping improved the overall detection rate in comparison to karyotyping-alone and vice versa. In cases with normal karyotypes oaCGH analysis detected genomic aberrations in 66% (39/60) of cases. In the group of simple karyotypes oaCGH analysis extended karyotypic findings in 39% (12/31) while oaCGH analysis extended the karyotypic findings in 89% (39/44) of cases with complex karyotypes. In 7% (5/75) of cases oaCGH analysis failed in detecting the observed abnormalities by karyotyping.

The prototypical NAMPT inhibitor FK866 effectively lowers NAD(+) levels in cancer cells, reducing the activity of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes, lowering intracellular ATP, and promoting cell death. RESULTS: We show that FK866 induces a translational arrest in leukemia cells through inhibition of MTOR/4EBP1 signaling and of the initiation factors EIF4E and EIF2A. Specifically, treatment with FK866 is shown to induce 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which, together with EIF2A phosphorylation, is responsible for the inhibition of protein synthesis. Notably, such an effect was also observed in patients' derived primary leukemia cells including T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Jurkat cells in which AMPK or LKB1 expression was silenced or in which a non-phosphorylatable EIF2A mutant was ectopically expressed showed enhanced sensitivity to the NAMPT inhibitor, confirming a key role for the LKB1-AMPK-EIF2A axis in cell fate determination in response to energetic stress via NAD(+) depletion. CONCLUSIONS: We identified EIF2A phosphorylation as a novel early molecular event occurring in response to NAMPT inhibition and mediating protein synthesis arrest. In addition, our data suggest that tumors exhibiting an impaired LBK1- AMPK- EIF2A response may be especially susceptible to NAMPT inhibitors and thus become an elective indication for this type of agents.","['Zucal, Chiara', ""D'Agostino, Vito G"", 'Casini, Antonio', 'Mantelli, Barbara', 'Thongon, Natthakan', 'Soncini, Debora', 'Caffa, Irene', 'Cea, Michele', 'Ballestrero, Alberto', 'Quattrone, Alessandro', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Nencioni, Alessio', 'Provenzani, Alessandro']","['Zucal C', ""D'Agostino VG"", 'Casini A', 'Mantelli B', 'Thongon N', 'Soncini D', 'Caffa I', 'Cea M', 'Ballestrero A', 'Quattrone A', 'Indraccolo S', 'Nencioni A', 'Provenzani A']","['Laboratory of Genomic Screening, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. chiara.zucal@unitn.it.', 'Laboratory of Genomic Screening, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. vito.dagostino@unitn.it.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. antonio.casini@unitn.it.', 'Laboratory of Genomic Screening, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. barbara.mantelli@unitn.it.', 'Laboratory of Genomic Screening, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. natthakan.thongon@unitn.it.', 'Laboratory of Translational Networks, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. soncini.debora@gmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy. irene.caffa@libero.it.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy. michele.cea@unige.it.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy. aballestrero@unige.it.', 'Laboratory of Translational Networks, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. alessandro.quattrone@unitn.it.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy. stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy. alessio.nencioni@unige.it.', 'Laboratory of Genomic Screening, CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy. alessandro.provenzani@unitn.it.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151105,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Acrylamides/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1845-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1845-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Nov 5;15:855. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1845-1.,,PMC4636066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of aberrant CHFR promoter methylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in an attempt to improve prognostication. CHFR promoter methylation levels were analyzed in 358 newly diagnosed AML cases and 30 healthy donors by the use of quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we analyzed possible association between CHFR hypermethylation and hematological characteristics, chromosome abnormalities, genetic mutations, and survival. Hypermethylation of the CHFR promoter was observed in 24% (85 of 358) AML patients, but not in healthy individuals. CHFR hypermethylation correlated significantly with SRSF2 and DNMT3A mutations. Patients with hypermethylation exhibited lower overall survival and shorter relapse-free survival than nonmethylated cases. In multivariate analysis, CHFR hypermethylation was an independent factor predicting poor overall survival but not relapse-free survival. In conclusion, hypermethylation of the CHFR promoter, frequent in AML, is associated with adverse outcome, and can thus be used for risk stratification.","['Gao, Li', 'Liu, Fang', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Sun, Junzhong', 'Ma, Yigai']","['Gao L', 'Liu F', 'Zhang H', 'Sun J', 'Ma Y']","['Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (CHFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/10/16 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22322 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2016 Feb;55(2):158-68. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22322.

There were 9 dose-escalation cohorts ranging from 20 mg to 600 mg once daily with twice-daily regimens of 240 mg and 300 mg. Twenty-four of 25 evaluable chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (96%) responded to ONO/GS-4059, with a median treatment duration of 80 weeks; 21 CLL patients remain on treatment. Lymph node responses were rapid and associated with a concurrent lymphocytosis. Eleven of 12 evaluable patients with mantle cell lymphoma (92%) responded (median treatment duration, 40 weeks). Eleven of 31 non-germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients (35%) responded but median treatment duration was 12 weeks due to development of progressive disease. ONO/GS-4059 was very well tolerated with 75% of adverse events (AEs) being Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 grade 1 or grade 2. Grade 3/4 AEs were mainly hematologic and recovered spontaneously during therapy. One CLL patient experienced a grade 3 treatment-related bleeding event (spontaneous muscle hematoma) but no clinically significant diarrhea, cardiac dysrhythmias, or arthralgia were observed. No maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the CLL cohort. In the non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort, 4 patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity, yielding an MTD of 480 mg once daily. ONO/GS-4059 has significant activity in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies without major drug-related toxicity. The selectivity of ONO/GS-4059 should confer advantages in combination therapies.

Increased expression of the ETS-related transcription factor gene ERG has been described in myeloid malignancies with chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome band 21q22, but also in cytogenetically normal AML, where it is associated with adverse prognosis. In this study, fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase nuclei disclosed an amplification of the ERG gene (more than six copies) in 33 AML patients with structural rearrangements of 21q22. Array comparative genomic hybridization of these cases disclosed a minimal amplified region at the position 39.6-40.0 Mbp from pter that harbors ERG as the only gene. Analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed significantly higher ERG mRNA expression in these patients and in a group of 95 AML patients with complete or partial gain of chromosome 21 (three to six copies) compared with 351 AML patients without gain of chromosome 21. Quantification of ERG DNA copy numbers revealed a strong correlation with ERG mRNA expression. Furthermore, in patients with gain of chromosome 21, higher ERG expression was found to be associated with RUNX1 mutations. Our results suggest that acquired gain of chromosome 21 or amplification of chromosome arm 21q is one mechanism contributing to increased ERG expression in AML.","['Weber, Simone', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Jeromin, Sabine', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Noel, Louisa', 'Zenger, Melanie', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schnittger, Susanne']","['Weber S', 'Haferlach C', 'Jeromin S', 'Nadarajah N', 'Dicker F', 'Noel L', 'Zenger M', 'Alpermann T', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151106,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Duplication', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/10/16 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22321 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2016 Feb;55(2):148-57. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22321.

Quality of life (QOL) and well-being among AML survivors have been extensively studied during the 6 months of active treatment. However, it is not clear what survivors experience after active treatment. The purpose of our study was to explore how AML survivors describe their longer-term physical and psychosocial well-being and how they cope with these challenges. METHODS: We conducted a prospective qualitative study and interviewed 19 adult participants (11 had completed treatment, 8 were receiving maintenance chemotherapy). Data were collected using semi-structured interviews that were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. RESULTS: A marked improvement in physical health was reported; however, psychosocial well-being was compromised by enduring emotional distress. A range of emotion- and problem-focused coping strategies were reported. Keeping one's mind off negative things through engaging in formal work or informal activities and seeking control were the two most commonly used coping strategies. Seeking social support for reassurance was also common. Problem-focused strategies were frequently described by the ongoing treatment group to manage treatment side effects. CONCLUSION: Although physical symptoms improved after completion of treatment, psychosocial distress persisted over longer period of time. In addition, essential needs of AML survivors shifted across survivorship as psychological burden gradually displaced physical concerns. The integral role of coping mechanisms in the adaptation process suggests a need for effective and ongoing psychological interventions.","['Ghodraty-Jabloo, Vida', 'Alibhai, Shabbir M H', 'Breunis, Henriette', 'Puts, Martine T E']","['Ghodraty-Jabloo V', 'Alibhai SMH', 'Breunis H', 'Puts MTE']","['Lawrence S.

However, the functions of specific RBPs and the molecular mechanisms through which they act in monocyte/macrophage differentiation remain to be determined. In this study, through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, we identify that ZFP36L1, a member of ZFP36 zinc finger protein family, exhibits significant decrease in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients compared with normal controls and remarkable time-course increase during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of PMA-induced THP-1 and HL-60 cells as well as induction culture of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Lentivirus-mediated gain and loss of function assays demonstrate that ZFP36L1 acts as a positive regulator to participate in monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Mechanistic investigation further reveals that ZFP36L1 binds to the CDK6 mRNA 3'untranslated region bearing adenine-uridine rich elements and negatively regulates the expression of CDK6 which is subsequently demonstrated to impede the in vitro monocyte/macrophage differentiation of CD34(+) HSPCs. Collectively, our work unravels a ZFP36L1-mediated regulatory circuit through repressing CDK6 expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which may also provide a therapeutic target for AML therapy.","['Chen, Ming-Tai', 'Dong, Lei', 'Zhang, Xin-Hua', 'Yin, Xiao-Lin', 'Ning, Hong-Mei', 'Shen, Chao', 'Su, Rui', 'Li, Feng', 'Song, Li', 'Ma, Yan-Ni', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhao, Hua-Lu', 'Yu, Jia', 'Zhang, Jun-Wu']","['Chen MT', 'Dong L', 'Zhang XH', 'Yin XL', 'Ning HM', 'Shen C', 'Su R', 'Li F', 'Song L', 'Ma YN', 'Wang F', 'Zhao HL', 'Yu J', 'Zhang JW']","['The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'Haematology Department, the 303 Hospital, Nanning, China.', 'Haematology Department, the 303 Hospital, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital to Academy of Military Medical Science, Beijing, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151106,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Butyrate Response Factor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ZFP36L1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Butyrate Response Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/09/27 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['srep16229 [pii]', '10.1038/srep16229 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Nov 6;5:16229. doi: 10.1038/srep16229.,,PMC4635361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explored the in vitro and in vivo activity of PF-00477736 (Pfizer), a potent, selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and with lower efficacy of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2). METHODS: The effectiveness of PF-00477736 as single agent in B-/T-ALL was evaluated in vitro and in vivo studies as a single agent. The efficacy of the compound in terms of cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and changes in gene and protein expression was assessed using different B-/T-ALL cell lines. Finally, the action of PF-00477736 was assessed in vivo using leukemic mouse generated by a single administration of the tumorigenic agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. RESULTS: Chk1 and Chk2 are overexpressed concomitant with the presence of genetic damage as suggested by the nuclear labeling for gamma-H2A.X (Ser139) in 68 % of ALL patients. In human B- and T-ALL cell lines, inhibition of Chk1/2 as a single treatment strategy efficiently triggered the Chk1-Cdc25-Cdc2 pathway resulting in a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and increased DNA damage. Moreover, treatment with PF-00477736 showed efficacy ex vivo in primary leukemic blasts separated from 14 adult ALL patients and in vivo in mice transplanted with T-ALL, arguing in favor of its future clinical evaluation in leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo results support the inhibition of Chk1 as a new therapeutic strategy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and they provide a strong rationale for its future clinical investigation.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Di Rora, Andrea Ghelli Luserna', 'Falzacappa, Maria Vittoria Verga', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Derenzini, Enrico', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Righi, Simona', 'Imbrogno, Enrica', 'Pomella, Silvia', 'Venturi, Claudia', 'Guadagnuolo, Viviana', 'Cattina, Federica', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Abbenante, Maria Chiara', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Iacobucci I', 'Di Rora AG', 'Falzacappa MV', 'Agostinelli C', 'Derenzini E', 'Ferrari A', 'Papayannidis C', 'Lonetti A', 'Righi S', 'Imbrogno E', 'Pomella S', 'Venturi C', 'Guadagnuolo V', 'Cattina F', 'Ottaviani E', 'Abbenante MC', 'Vitale A', 'Elia L', 'Russo D', 'Zinzani PL', 'Pileri S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

The most potent effect was observed for high molecular weight fucoidan CF from the alga Chordaria flagelliformis, whose backbone is built of (1-->3)-linked units of alpha-L-fucopyranose, and branches included residues of alpha-D-glucuronic acid and alpha-L-fucofuranose. This compound at the concentration of 0.05 mg/ml potentiated phagocytosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus acidophilus by neutrophils, increasing relative quantity of phagocytes as well as their effectiveness. Along with this, 14% increase in the concentration of membrane-bound integrin CD11c molecules was observed. The systemic effect of CF at the dose of 0.01 mg/mouse i.p. led to potentiation of cytotoxic activity of spleen mononuclear leucocytes towards melanoma cells of line B16 by 1.9-fold and towards chronic myelogenous leukemia cells of line K-562 by 1.7-fold.

However, most of the pathways responsible for RA effects remain unknown. To investigate such pathways, we used a RA-induced differentiation model in the human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y. Our data showed that n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced cells' proliferation rate and increased cells' sensitivity to RA toxicity. Simultaneously, NAC pre-incubation attenuated nuclear factor erythroid 2-like factor 2 (NRF2) activation by RA. None of these effects were obtained with Trolox((R)) as antioxidant, suggesting a cysteine signalization by RA. NRF2 knockdown increased cell sensibility to RA after 96 h of treatment and diminished neuroblastoma proliferation rate. Conversely, NRF2 overexpression limited RA anti-proliferative effects and increased cell proliferation. In addition, a rapid and non-genomic activation of the ERK 1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways revealed to be equally required to promote NRF2 activation and necessary for RA-induced differentiation. Together, we provide data correlating NRF2 activity with neuroblastoma proliferation and resistance to RA treatments; thus, this pathway could be a potential target to optimize neuroblastoma chemotherapeutic response as well as in vitro neuronal differentiation protocols.","['de Miranda Ramos, Vitor', 'Zanotto-Filho, Alfeu', 'de Bittencourt Pasquali, Matheus Augusto', 'Klafke, Karina', 'Gasparotto, Juciano', 'Dunkley, Peter', 'Gelain, Daniel Pens', 'Moreira, Jose Claudio Fonseca']","['de Miranda Ramos V', 'Zanotto-Filho A', 'de Bittencourt Pasquali MA', 'Klafke K', 'Gasparotto J', 'Dunkley P', 'Gelain DP', 'Moreira JCF']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil. vitorramos1908@gmail.com.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Ciencias Basicas da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Ramiro Barcelos, 2600, Porto Alegre, RS, 90035-035, Brazil.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151105,United States,Mol Neurobiol,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2016/11/01 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12035-015-9506-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12035-015-9506-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Neurobiol. 2016 Nov;53(9):6124-6135. doi: 10.1007/s12035-015-9506-6.

High-throughput biochemical analysis of MLL1 methyltransferase activity requires the production of at least a trimeric complex of MLL1, RbBP5 and WDR5 to elicit robust activity. Production of trimeric and higher order MLL1 complexes in the quantities and reproducibility required for high-throughput screening presents a significant impediment to MLL1 drug discovery efforts. We present here a small molecule fluorescent ligand (FL-NAH, 6) that is able to bind to the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site of MLL1 in a manner independent of the associated complex members. We have used FL-NAH to develop a fluorescence polarization-based SAM displacement assay in a 384-well format targeting the MLL1 SET domain in the absence of associated complex members. FL-NAH competes with SAM and is displaced from the MLL1 SET domain by other SAM-binding site ligands with Kdisp values similar to the higher-order complexes, but is unaffected by the H3 peptide substrate. This assay enables screening for SAM-competitive MLL1 inhibitors without requiring the use of trimeric or higher order MLL1 complexes, significantly reducing screening time and cost.","['Luan, Yepeng', 'Blazer, Levi L', 'Hu, Hao', 'Hajian, Taraneh', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wu, Hong', 'Houliston, Scott', 'Arrowsmith, Cheryl H', 'Vedadi, Masoud', 'Zheng, Yujun George']","['Luan Y', 'Blazer LL', 'Hu H', 'Hajian T', 'Zhang J', 'Wu H', 'Houliston S', 'Arrowsmith CH', 'Vedadi M', 'Zheng YG']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA. yzheng@uga.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Org Biomol Chem,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,101154995,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/economics/*methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Fluorescence', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors']",2015/11/07 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5ob01794g [doi]'],ppublish,Org Biomol Chem. 2016 Jan 14;14(2):631-638. doi: 10.1039/c5ob01794g.,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 GM086717/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4689628,['NIHMS736202'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age at HCT was 53.7 years. The majority of patients received a peripheral blood stem cell transplant (81%) following nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning (55%). Pediatric age group and use of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood grafts were underrepresented in our cohort (</=11%). The cumulative incidence of late aGVHD (late onset and recurrent) was 10% at a median of 5.5 months post-HCT, that of cGVHD was 47% at a median of 7.4 months, that of bronchiolitis obliterans was 3% at a median of 12.2 months, and that of cutaneous sclerosis was 8% at a median onset of 14.0 months. Late aGVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans had particularly high nonrelapse mortality of 23% and 32%, respectively, by 2 years after diagnosis. The probability of late aGVHD- and cGVHD-free, relapse-free survival was 38% at 1 year post-HCT and 26% at 2 years post-HCT. This multicenter prospective study confirms the high rate of late aGVHD and cGVHD syndromes and supports the need for continuous close monitoring and development of more effective GVHD treatment strategies to improve HCT success.","['Arora, Mukta', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Jagasia, Madan H', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Chai, Xiaoyu', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Chen, George L', 'Wood, William A', 'Khera, Nandita', 'Palmer, Jeanne', 'Duong, Hien', 'Arai, Sally', 'Mayer, Sebastian', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Lee, Stephanie J']","['Arora M', 'Cutler CS', 'Jagasia MH', 'Pidala J', 'Chai X', 'Martin PJ', 'Flowers ME', 'Inamoto Y', 'Chen GL', 'Wood WA', 'Khera N', 'Palmer J', 'Duong H', 'Arai S', 'Mayer S', 'Pusic I', 'Lee SJ']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplant, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

To gain insights into the functional importance of gliosis, we developed a new model of adolescent closed-head injury (CHI) and interrogated the behavioral, physiological, and cellular outcomes after a concussive CHI in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) haplodeficient mice. These mice were chosen because LIF is important for astrocyte and microglial activation. Behaviorally, the LIF haplodeficient animals were equally impaired 4 h after the injury, but in the subsequent 2 weeks, the LIF haplodeficient mice acquired more severe motor and sensory deficits, compared with wild type mice. The prolonged accumulation of neurological impairment was accompanied by desynchronization of the gliotic response, increased cell death, axonal degeneration, diminished callosal compound action potential, and hypomyelination. Our results clearly show that LIF is an essential injury-induced cytokine that is required to prevent the propagation of secondary neurodegeneration.","['Goodus, Matthew T', 'Kerr, Nadine A', 'Talwar, Ruchika', 'Buziashvili, David', 'Fragale, Jennifer E C', 'Pang, Kevin C H', 'Levison, Steven W']","['Goodus MT', 'Kerr NA', 'Talwar R', 'Buziashvili D', 'Fragale JE', 'Pang KC', 'Levison SW']","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.', '2 Veterans Affairs Medical Center , New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.', '2 Veterans Affairs Medical Center , New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange, New Jersey.', '1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School , Newark, New Jersey.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160128,United States,J Neurotrauma,Journal of neurotrauma,8811626,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/deficiency/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Head Injuries, Closed/*metabolism/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice']",2015/11/07 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2015/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/neu.2015.4234 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurotrauma. 2016 Aug 15;33(16):1522-34. doi: 10.1089/neu.2015.4234.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces apoptosis in all CLL cell types and could constitute an efficient therapy. To further explore this, we have studied the influence of stromal cells, key components of the CLL microenvironment, on the response of CLL cells to ATO. Bone marrow stromal cells induced CLL cell resistance to 2 muM ATO and led to activation of Lyn, ERK, PI3K and PKC, as well as NF-kappaB and STAT3. Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bfl-1 were also upregulated after the co-culture. Inhibition experiments indicated that PI3K and PKC were involved in the resistance to ATO induced by stroma. Moreover, idelalisib and sotrastaurin, specific inhibitors for PI3Kdelta and PKCbeta, respectively, inhibited Akt phosphorylation, NF-kappaB/STAT3 activation and Mcl-1 upregulation, and rendered cells sensitive to ATO. Mcl-1 was central to the mechanism of resistance to ATO, since: 1) Mcl-1 levels correlated with the CLL cell response to ATO, and 2) blocking Mcl-1 expression or function with specific siRNAs or inhibitors overcame the protecting effect of stroma. We have therefore identified the mechanism involved in the CLL cell resistance to ATO induced by bone marrow stroma and show that idelalisib or sotrastaurin block this mechanism and restore sensibility to ATO. Combination of ATO with these inhibitors may thus constitute an efficient treatment for CLL.","['Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Aguilera-Montilla, Noemi', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Bailon E', 'Aguilera-Montilla N', 'Terol MJ', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Unit, Hematology Department, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Microenvironment', 'Up-Regulation']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['6265 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6265 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 29;6(42):44832-48. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6265.,,PMC4792595,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Mcl-1', 'arsenic trioxide', 'idelalisib', 'stromal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this period specific regulatory molecules involved in the maturation process have been identified by biochemical and molecular biological methods. Recent developments of high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic techniques made it possible to analyze large sets of mRNA and proteins; this resulted in identification of functionally important signal transduction pathways and networks of molecular interactions, and thus extent existing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of induced differentiation. Despite significant advances in mechanisms of induced differentiation, many problems related to the molecular mechanism of cell maturation, a phenomenon of therapeutic resistance of leukemic cells need better understanding and thus require further detailed study. Transcriptomics and proteomics methods provide a suitable methodological platform for the implementation of such studies. This review highlights the use of transcriptomic and proteomic methods in studies aimed at various aspects of the induced differentiation. Special attention is paid to the employment of the systems approach for investigation of various aspects of cell maturation.

We hypothesised that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity, which is crucial for repair of DNA breaks induced by oxidative stress or chemotherapy, may be an additional predictive biomarker and a target for therapy with PARP inhibitors.We measured PARP activity in 109 patient-derived CLL samples, which varied widely (192 - 190052 pmol PAR/10(6) cells) compared to that seen in healthy volunteer lymphocytes (2451 - 7519 pmol PAR/10(6) cells). PARP activity was associated with PARP1 protein expression and endogenous PAR levels. PARP activity was not associated with p53 or ATM loss, Binet stage, IGHV mutational status or survival, but correlated with Bcl-2 and Rel A (an NF-kB subunit).

Whether this is important in the development or progression of CLL is controversial. We interrogated associations between blood EBV-DNA copy number and biological and clinical variables in 243 new-diagnosed consecutive subjects with CLL. Quantification of EBV-DNA copies was done by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). All subjects had serological evidence of prior EBV-infection. However, only 24 subjects (10%) had a EBV-DNA-positive test at diagnosis. EBV-DNA-positive subjects at diagnosis had lower hemoglobin concentrations and platelet levels, higher thymidine kinase-1 and serum ferritin levels, un-mutated IGHV genes and a greater risk of Richter transformation compared with EBV-DNA-negative subjects. Percent CD20-, CD148- and ZAP70-positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each cluster designation were also increased in EBV-DNA-positive subjects at diagnosis. EBV-DNA test positivity was associated with a briefer time-to-treatment interval (HR 1.85; [95% confidence interval, 1.13, 3.03]; P=0.014) and worse survival (HR 2.77; [1.18, 6.49]; P=0.019). Reduction in EBV copies was significantly associated with therapy-response. A positive blood EBV-DNA test at diagnosis and sequential testing of EBV copies during therapy were significantly associated with biological and clinical variables, time-to-treatment, therapy-response and survival.

The results were less spectacular, but nevertheless important. Progress has been made toward understanding the mechanism of action of retinoids in different physiological and pathological contexts. For some diseases, specific genetic backgrounds were found to confer responsiveness to retinoid therapy.

PML is the core component of subnuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which are disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. PML plays important roles in cell cycle regulation, survival and apoptosis, and inactivation or down-regulation of PML is frequently found in cancer cells. More than 120 proteins have been experimentally identified to physically associate with PML, and most of them either transiently or constitutively co-localize with PML-NBs. These interactions are associated with many cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and intermediary metabolism. Importantly, PML inactivation in cancer cells can occur at the transcriptional-, translational- or post-translational- levels. However, only a few somatic mutations have been found in cancer cells. A better understanding of its regulation and its role in tumor suppression will provide potential therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we discuss the role of PML in multiple tumor suppression pathways and summarize the players and stimuli that control PML protein expression or subcellular distribution.","['Guan, Dongyin', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Guan D', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151104,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,2015/11/06 06:00,2015/11/06 06:01,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-015-0051-9 [doi]', '51 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2015 Nov 4;5:60. doi: 10.1186/s13578-015-0051-9. eCollection 2015.,"['R01 DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093269/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4632682,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PML', 'PML nuclear bodies', 'Therapy', 'Tumor suppressor protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that molecular signatures based on DNA-methylation (DNAm) patterns can be used for classification of the disease. In this study, we followed the hypothesis that DNAm at a single CpG site might support risk stratification in AML. FINDINGS: Using DNAm profiles of 194 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified a CpG site in complement component 1 subcomponent R (C1R) as best suited biomarker: patients with higher methylation at this CpG site (>27 % DNAm) reveal significantly longer overall survival (53 versus 11 months; P < 0.0001). This finding was validated in an independent set of 62 DNAm profiles of cytogenetically normal AML patients (P = 0.009) and with a region-specific pyrosequencing assay in 84 AML samples (P = 0.012). DNAm of C1R correlated with genomic DNAm and gene expression patterns, whereas there was only moderate association with gene expression levels of C1R. These results indicate that DNAm of C1R is a biomarker reflecting chromatin reorganization rather than being of pathophysiological relevance per se. Notably, DNAm of C1R was associated with occurrence of specific genomic mutations that are traditionally used for risk stratification in AML. Furthermore, DNAm of C1R correlates also with overall survival in several other types of cancer, but the prognostic relevance was less pronounced than in AML. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of DNAm at C1R provides a simple, robust, and cost-effective biomarker to further complement risk assessment in AML.","['Bozic, Tanja', 'Lin, Qiong', 'Frobel, Joana', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Hoffmann, Melanie', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Wagner, Wolfgang']","['Bozic T', 'Lin Q', 'Frobel J', 'Wilop S', 'Hoffmann M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Jost E', 'Wagner W']","['Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 20, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering - Cell Biology, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 20, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering - Cell Biology, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 20, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering - Cell Biology, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 20, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Engineering - Cell Biology, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151104,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,,2015/11/06 06:00,2015/11/06 06:01,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-015-0153-6 [doi]', '153 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2015 Nov 4;7:116. doi: 10.1186/s13148-015-0153-6. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4632269,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Biomarker', 'C1R', 'DNA-methylation', 'Epigenetic', 'Leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'Survival', 'TCGA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess the antitumor potential of BthTX-I, a basic myotoxic PLA2 isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom, by evaluating in vitro processes of cytotoxicity, modulation of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis in human (HL-60 and HepG2) and murine (PC-12 and B16F10) tumor cell lines. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of BthTX-I were evaluated on the tumor cell lines HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), PC-12 (murine pheochromocytoma) and B16F10 (murine melanoma) using the MTT method. Flow cytometry technique was used for the analysis of cell cycle alterations and death mechanisms (apoptosis and/or necrosis) induced in tumor cells after treatment with BthTX-I. RESULTS: It was observed that BthTX-I was cytotoxic to all evaluated tumor cell lines, reducing their viability in 40 to 50 %. The myotoxin showed modulating effects on the cell cycle of PC-12 and B16F10 cells, promoting delay in the G0/G1 phase. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis indicated cell death mainly by apoptosis. B16F10 was more susceptible to the effects of BthTX-I, with ~40 % of the cells analyzed in apoptosis, followed by HepG2 (~35 %), PC-12 (~25 %) and HL-60 (~4 %). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that BthTX-I presents antitumor properties that may be useful for developing new therapeutic strategies against cancer.","['Prinholato da Silva, Cassio', 'Costa, Tassia R', 'Paiva, Raquel M Alves', 'Cintra, Adelia C O', 'Menaldo, Danilo L', 'Antunes, Lusania M Greggi', 'Sampaio, Suely V']","['Prinholato da Silva C', 'Costa TR', 'Paiva RM', 'Cintra AC', 'Menaldo DL', 'Antunes LM', 'Sampaio SV']","['Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analyses, Toxicology and Food Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Avenida do Cafe, s/n, Ribeirao Preto, SP CEP 14040-903 Brazil.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151103,Brazil,J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis,The journal of venomous animals and toxins including tropical diseases,101201501,,,,2015/11/06 06:00,2015/11/06 06:01,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40409-015-0044-5 [doi]', '44 [pii]']",epublish,J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis. 2015 Nov 3;21:44. doi: 10.1186/s40409-015-0044-5. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4632473,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antitumor potential', 'Apoptosis', 'Bothrops jararacussu', 'BthTX-I', 'Cell cycle alterations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in the biology of MPNs have greatly facilitated their molecular diagnosis since most patients present with mutation(s) in the JAK2, MPL, or CALR genes. Yet the roles played by these mutations in the pathogenesis and main complications of the different subtypes of MPNs are not fully elucidated. Importantly, chronic inflammation has long been associated with MPN disease and some of the symptoms and complications can be linked to inflammation. Moreover, the JAK inhibitor clinical trials showed that the reduction of symptoms linked to inflammation was beneficial to patients even in the absence of significant decrease in the JAK2-V617F mutant load. These observations suggested that part of the inflammation observed in patients with JAK2-mutated MPNs may not be the consequence of JAK2 mutation. The aim of this paper is to review the different aspects of inflammation in MPNs, the molecular mechanisms involved, the role of specific genetic defects, and the evidence that increased production of certain cytokines depends or not on MPN-associated mutations, and to discuss possible nongenetic causes of inflammation.","['Hermouet, Sylvie', 'Bigot-Corbel, Edith', 'Gardie, Betty']","['Hermouet S', 'Bigot-Corbel E', 'Gardie B']","[""Inserm UMR 892, CNRS UMR 6299, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie Nantes-Angers, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Universite de Nantes, 44007 Nantes, France ; Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, 44093 Nantes Cedex, France."", 'Inserm UMR 892, CNRS UMR 6299, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie Nantes-Angers, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Universite de Nantes, 44007 Nantes, France ; Laboratoire de Biochimie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, 44093 Nantes Cedex, France.', 'Inserm UMR 892, CNRS UMR 6299, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie Nantes-Angers, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Universite de Nantes, 44007 Nantes, France ; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Laboratoire de Genetique Oncologique, 44007 Nantes, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151011,United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia']",IM,"['Calreticulin/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/genetics/physiopathology', 'Inflammation/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/physiopathology', 'Mastocytosis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/physiopathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/physiopathology']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/08/24 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/145293 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2015;2015:145293. doi: 10.1155/2015/145293.

However, information on associations between RAI dose and second primary malignancy (SPM) is lacking. METHODS: Patients without antecedent cancer age 20 years or older and newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer were recruited from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database between 1997 and 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for the cancers were calculated to compare the incidence of thyroid cancer with the general population. The association between RAI dosage and cancer development was estimated using time-dependent Cox regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 692 cases of SPM were identified among 20 235 patients with thyroid cancer. Regarding the latter, 79.7% of the patients were women, the median age was 46 years, and the follow-up period included 134 178 person-years. The SIR for any SPM was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31 to 1.52). A statistically significantly higher SIR was observed in leukemia (2.74), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.38), prostate (2.30), lung and mediastinum (1.93), pancreas (1.83), kidney (1.81), breast (1.48), and colon-rectum (1.31) cancers. Cumulative RAI dose (per 30 mCi increase) conferred a strong risk for SPM (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.02, P < .001) and leukemia (aHR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.04, P < .001) occurrences. A cumulative RAI dose greater than 150 mCi possessed a statistically significant risk for all cancer combined (aHR = 1.30) and leukemia (aHR = 6.03). CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of SPM was observed for thyroid cancer patients, especially with cumulative RAI doses over 150 mCi.","['Teng, Chung-Jen', 'Hu, Yu-Wen', 'Chen, San-Chi', 'Yeh, Chiu-Mei', 'Chiang, Huey-Ling', 'Chen, Tzeng-Ji', 'Liu, Chia-Jen']","['Teng CJ', 'Hu YW', 'Chen SC', 'Yeh CM', 'Chiang HL', 'Chen TJ', 'Liu CJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine (CJT) and Department of Psychiatry (HLC), Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan;

Overexpressing FLI1 in healthy mice results in the development of an autoimmune kidney disease similar to that observed in lupus. Lowering the global levels of FLI1 in two lupus strains (Fli1(+/-)) significantly improved kidney disease and prolonged survival. T cells from MRL/lpr Fli1(+/-) lupus mice have reduced activation and IL-4 production, neuraminidase 1 expression, and the levels of the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide. In this study, we demonstrate that MRL/lpr Fli1(+/-) mice have significantly decreased renal neuraminidase 1 and lactosylceramide levels. This corresponds with a significant decrease in the number of total CD3(+) cells, as well as CD4(+) and CD44(+)CD62L(-) T cell subsets in the kidney of MRL/lpr Fli1(+/-) mice compared with the Fli1(+/+) nephritic mice. We further demonstrate that the percentage of CXCR3(+) T cells and Cxcr3 message levels in T cells are significantly decreased and correspond with a decrease in renal CXCR3(+) cells and in Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 expression in the MRL/lpr Fli1(+/-) compared with the Fli1(+/+) nephritic mice.

Hypomorphic alleles of MRE11 and NBS1 confer embryonic lethality in ATM-deficient mice, indicating that the complex exerts ATM-independent functions that are essential when ATM is absent. To delineate those functions, a conditional ATM allele (ATM(flox)) was crossed to hypomorphic NBS1 mutants (Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB) mice). Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB) Atm(-/-) hematopoietic cells derived by crossing to vav(cre) were viable in vivo. Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB) Atm(-/-) (VAV) mice exhibited a pronounced defect in double-strand break repair and completely penetrant early onset lymphomagenesis. In addition to repair defects observed, fragile site instability was noted, indicating that the Mre11 complex promotes genome stability upon replication stress in vivo. The data suggest combined influences of the Mre11 complex on DNA repair, as well as the responses to DNA damage and DNA replication stress. IMPLICATIONS: A novel mouse model was developed, by combining a vav(cre)-inducible ATM knockout mouse with an NBS1 hypomorphic mutation, to analyze ATM-independent functions of the Mre11 complex in vivo. These data show that the DNA repair, rather than DDR signaling functions of the complex, is acutely required in the context of ATM deficiency to suppress genome instability and lymphomagenesis.","['Balestrini, Alessia', 'Nicolas, Laura', 'Yang-Lott, Katherine', 'Guryanova, Olga A', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Bassing, Craig H', 'Chaudhuri, Jayanta', 'Petrini, John H J']","['Balestrini A', 'Nicolas L', 'Yang-Lott K', 'Guryanova OA', 'Levine RL', 'Bassing CH', 'Chaudhuri J', 'Petrini JH']","['Molecular Biology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, New York.', 'Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Therefore disrupting the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis with antagonists is of great significance for improving chemosensitivity and decreasing relapse rate. In a previous study, we reported a novel synthetic peptide E5 with its remarkable effect on inhibiting CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated adhesion and migration of AML cells. Here we presented E5's capacity of enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of various chemotherapeutics on AML in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that E5 can diminish bone marrow stromal cell-provided protection to leukemia cells, significantly increasing the apoptosis induced by various chemotherapeutics in multiple AML cell lines. In an AML mouse xenograft model, E5 induced 1.84-fold increase of circulating AML cells out of protective stroma niche. Combined with vincristine or cyclophosphamide, E5 inhibited infiltration of AML cells into bone marrow, liver and spleen, as well as prolonged the lifespan of AML mice compared with mice treated with chemotherapy alone. In addition, E5 presented no toxicity in vivo according to the histological analysis and routine clinical parameters of serum analysis.","['Li, Xiaojin', 'Guo, Hua', 'Duan, Hongyang', 'Yang, Yanlian', 'Meng, Jie', 'Liu, Jian', 'Wang, Chen', 'Xu, Haiyan']","['Li X', 'Guo H', 'Duan H', 'Yang Y', 'Meng J', 'Liu J', 'Wang C', 'Xu H']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, P.

Within this family, the myeloid cell leukemia factor 1 (Mcl-1) protein exists in two forms as the result of alternative splicing. The long variant (Mcl-1L) acts as an antiapoptotic factor, whereas the short isoform (Mcl-1S) displays proapoptotic activity. In this study, using splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), we increased the synthesis of Mcl-1S, which induced a concurrent reduction of Mcl-1L, resulting in increased sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli. The Mcl-1 ASOs also induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization and a consequent increase in mitochondrial calcium (Ca(2+)) accumulation. The high Mcl-1S/L ratio correlated with significant hyperfusion of the entire mitochondrial network, which occurred in a dynamin-related protein (Drp1)-dependent manner. Our data indicate that the balance between the long and short variants of the Mcl-1 gene represents a key aspect of the regulation of mitochondrial physiology. We propose that the Mcl-1L/S balance is a novel regulatory factor controlling the mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery.","['Morciano, Giampaolo', 'Giorgi, Carlotta', 'Balestra, Dario', 'Marchi, Saverio', 'Perrone, Daniela', 'Pinotti, Mirko', 'Pinton, Paolo']","['Morciano G', 'Giorgi C', 'Balestra D', 'Marchi S', 'Perrone D', 'Pinotti M', 'Pinton P']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, FE 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara, FE 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, FE 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies paolo.pinton@unife.it.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mitochondrial Dynamics/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/11/02 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['mbc.E15-01-0028 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E15-01-0028 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2016 Jan 1;27(1):20-34. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E15-01-0028.

Elevated CD1d expression is detected in CD5(+) IL10-producing B cells, called B10 B cells, and is correlated with poorer prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a CD5(+) B cell malignancy with B10-like functional properties. Whether CD1d expression regulates CD5(+) B cell accumulation, IL10 competence, and antibody production in naive mice with pathologic CD5(+) B cell expansion remains untested. RESULTS: Using three different transgenic mouse models of benign or leukemic CD5(+) B cell expansion, we found that CD1d was differentially expressed on CD5(+) B cells between the three models, but loss of CD1d expression had no effect on CD5(+) B cell abundance or inducible IL10 expression in any of the models. Interestingly, in the CLL-prone Emu-TCL1 model, loss of CD1d expression suppressed spontaneous IgG (but not IgM) production, whereas in the dnRAG1xEmu-TCL1 (DTG) model of accelerated CLL, loss of CD1d expression was associated with elevated numbers of splenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and an inverted CD4(+):CD8(+) T cell ratio. Unexpectedly, before leukemia onset, all three transgenic CD1d-deficient mouse strains had fewer splenic transitional B cells than their CD1d-proficient counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that CD1d expression and iNKT cells are dispensable for the development, accumulation, or IL10 competence of CD5(+) B cells in mice prone to benign or leukemic CLL-like B cell expansion, but reveal a novel role for iNKT cells in supporting B cell progression through the transitional stage of development in these animals. These results suggest CD1d-directed therapies to target CLL could be evaded by downregulating CD1d expression with little effect on continued leukemic CD5(+) B cell survival. The data also imply that iNKT cells help restrain pro-leukemic CD8(+) T cell expansion in CLL, potentially explaining a reported correlation in human CLL between disease progression, the loss of NKT cells, and a paradoxical increase in CD8(+) T cells.","['Palmer, Victoria L', 'Nganga, Vincent K', 'Rothermund, Mary E', 'Perry, Greg A', 'Swanson, Patrick C']","['Palmer VL', 'Nganga VK', 'Rothermund ME', 'Perry GA', 'Swanson PC']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University, 2500 California Plaza, Omaha, NE, 68178, USA.

The aim of this study was to report the identification of lncRNA-CTD-2108O9.1, which we have named lncRNA low expressed in gastric cancer (lncRNA-LOWEG), and investigate its role in cancer development. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from the tissues of 94 patients with GC, one normal gastric epithelial cell line and four GC cell lines. Expression levels of lncRNA-LOWEG were determined by real-time PCR. Moreover, CCK-8 proliferation assay, transwell cell invasion assay and flow cytometry were performed to study the effects of lncRNA-LOWEG on SGC-7901 cell proliferation, cell invasion and cell cycle progression. Lastly, western blot and real-time PCR were used to verify the potential target genes of lncRNA-LOWEG. RESULTS: Significantly reduced expression of lncRNA-LOWEG was found in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines (SGC-7901, AGS, BGC-823 and HG-27) compared with patient-matched nontumorous adjacent tissues (P < 0.01) or the normal gastric cell line GES-1 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the transwell assay showed that the number of cells capable of passing through the Matrigel was significantly reduced after lncRNA-LOWEG transfection (P < 0.05). However, lncRNA-LOWEG overexpression did not significantly influence cell proliferation (P > 0.05) and cell cycle progression (P > 0.05). Lastly, western blot and real-time PCR analysis suggested that lncRNA-LOWEG is positively correlated with the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene at the translational level. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA-LOWEG is a tumor suppressor that inhibits GC cell invasion. And LIFR gene is up-regulated by lncRNA-LOWEG.","['Zhao, Jun-Hua', 'Sun, Jing-Xu', 'Song, Yong-Xi', 'Chen, Xiao-Wan', 'Yang, Yu-Chong', 'Ma, Bin', 'Wang, Jun', 'Gao, Peng', 'Wang, Zhen-Ning']","['Zhao JH', 'Sun JX', 'Song YX', 'Chen XW', 'Yang YC', 'Ma B', 'Wang J', 'Gao P', 'Wang ZN']","[""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Surgical Oncology and General Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China. josieon826@sina.cn.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*physiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/*pathology']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/06/30 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-015-2071-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-2071-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Mar;142(3):601-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-2071-6.

This meta-analysis aims to quantitatively synthesize the published data on the association between parental age and risk of two major distinct childhood leukemia types in the offspring. Eligible studies were identified and pooled relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated using random-effects models, separately for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Subgroup analyses were performed by study design, geographical region, adjustment factors; sensitivity analyses and meta-regression analyses were also undertaken. 77 studies (69 case-control and eight cohort) were deemed eligible. Older maternal and paternal age were associated with increased risk for childhood ALL (pooled RR = 1.05, 95 % CI 1.01-1.10; pooled RR = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.08, per 5 year increments, respectively). The association between maternal age and risk of childhood AML showed a U-shaped pattern, with symmetrically associated increased risk in the oldest (pooled RR = 1.23, 95 % CI 1.06-1.43) and the youngest (pooled RR = 1.23, 95 % CI 1.07-1.40) extremes. Lastly, only younger fathers were at increased risk of having a child with AML (pooled RR = 1.28, 95 % CI 1.04-1.59). In conclusion, maternal and paternal age represents a meaningful risk factor for childhood leukemia, albeit of different effect size by leukemia subtype. Genetic and socio-economic factors may underlie the observed associations. Well-adjusted studies, scheduled by large consortia, are anticipated to satisfactorily address methodological issues, whereas the potential underlying genetic mechanisms should be elucidated by basic research studies.","['Sergentanis, Theodoros N', 'Thomopoulos, Thomas P', 'Gialamas, Spyros P', 'Karalexi, Maria A', 'Biniaris-Georgallis, Stylianos-Iason', 'Kontogeorgi, Evangelia', 'Papathoma, Paraskevi', 'Tsilimidos, Gerasimos', 'Skalkidou, Alkistis', 'Iliadou, Anastasia N', 'Petridou, Eleni T']","['Sergentanis TN', 'Thomopoulos TP', 'Gialamas SP', 'Karalexi MA', 'Biniaris-Georgallis SI', 'Kontogeorgi E', 'Papathoma P', 'Tsilimidos G', 'Skalkidou A', 'Iliadou AN', 'Petridou ET']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National University of Athens, 75 M.

However, direct comparison of the clinical significance according to consolidation therapy has not been widely performed in patients with NK-AML. A total of 404 patients with NK-AML who received intensive induction chemotherapy were included in the present study. Diagnostic samples from the patients were evaluated for CEBPA mutations by direct sequencing. CEBPA single (sm) or double mutation (dm) was observed in 27 (6.7 %) and 51 (12.6 %) patients, respectively. CEBPA (dm) was associated with GATA2 (mut), and it was less frequently associated with FLT3-ITD(pos), NPM1 (mut), and DNMT3A (mut) in comparison with CEBPA (wild) or CEBPA (sm) (all p values <0.05). On multivariate analysis, CEBPA (dm) (p = 0.007, OR 39.593) was an independent risk factor for achievement of complete remission (CR). With a median follow-up of 40.1 months, CEBPA (dm) showed a favorable overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and lower relapse incidence (RI) in comparison with CEBPA (wild) (all p values <0.005). Comparison of clinical outcome analyses (consolidation chemotherapy vs. allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)) demonstrated the role of consolidation treatment in patients with CEBPA (dm). Allogeneic HCT was associated with lower EFS and RI and a trend of higher non-relapse mortality. However, there was no statistically significant difference in OS. In conclusion, CEBPA (dm) was associated with other molecular mutations. Consolidation chemotherapy alone may overcome higher relapse rates by reducing the treatment mortality and increasing survival after relapse events in patients with CEBPA (dm) in NK-AML.","['Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Kim, Jae-Young', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Lee, Seung-Shin', 'Jung, Sung-Hoon', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Kim, Nan Young', 'Choi, Seung Hyun', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Jang, Jun-Ho', 'Kim, Hee Je', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Won, Jong-Ho', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Ahn JS', 'Kim JY', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YK', 'Lee SS', 'Jung SH', 'Yang DH', 'Lee JJ', 'Kim NY', 'Choi SH', 'Minden MD', 'Jung CW', 'Jang JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Moon JH', 'Sohn SK', 'Won JH', 'Kim SH', 'Kim DD']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea. hjoonk@chonnam.ac.kr.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, 322 Seoyangro, Hwasun, Jeollanamdo, 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Colllege of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea."", 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Humans', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/05/21 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-015-2540-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-015-2540-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Jan;95(2):301-10. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2540-7.

METHODS: Ninety participants aged above 18 years were selected and divided into three groups, each comprising 30 individuals. The Control Group was composed of physically healthy subjects, with no cancer history; and there were two experimental groups: those diagnosed as acute lymphocytic leukemia, and those as Wilms' Tumor. Quality of life was assessed over the telephone, using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. RESULTS: Male survivors presented with better results as compared to female survivors and controls in the Vitality domain, for acute lymphocytic leukemia (p=0.042) and Wilms' tumor (p=0.013). For acute lymphocytic leukemia survivors, in Social aspects (p=0.031), Mental health (p=0.041), and Emotional aspects (p=0.040), the latter also for survivors of Wilms' tumor (p=0.040). The best results related to the Functional capacity domain were recorded for the experimental group that had a late diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia. There were significant differences between groups except for the Social and Emotional domains for self-perceived health, with positive responses that characterized their health as good, very good, and excellent. CONCLUSION: Survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia showed no evidence of relevant impairment of health-related quality of life. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (via telephone) can be a resource to access and evaluate survivors.","['Souza, Clelia Marta Casellato de', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Cornacchioni, Ana Lucia Beltrati', 'Odone Filho, Vicente', 'Kuczynski, Evelyn']","['Souza CM', 'Cristofani LM', 'Cornacchioni AL', 'Odone Filho V', 'Kuczynski E']","['Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",,"['eng', 'por']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20151030,Brazil,Einstein (Sao Paulo),"Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101281800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/psychology', '*Quality of Life', '*Self Report', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Telephone', 'Wilms Tumor/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/08/06 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1679-45082015005003231 [pii]', '10.1590/S1679-45082015AO3231 [doi]']",ppublish,Einstein (Sao Paulo). 2015 Oct-Dec;13(4):492-9. doi: 10.1590/S1679-45082015AO3231.

Acquired genetic mutations in the PML moiety of the PML-RARA fusion gene are found in some patients with relapsed/refractory APL. Whether all of the identified point mutations play a role and have a similar function in the mechanisms of arsenic resistance remains unknown. Here we performed in vitro functional analyses and a retrospective analysis of APL patients to investigate the effect of PML-RARA mutations in mediating resistance to arsenic trioxide. Among the 5-point mutations in the PML part of PML-RARA identified in patients with relapsed APL, we found that A216V, S214L, and A216T mutations could attenuate the negative regulation of arsenic on PML-RARA, resulting in the retention of oncoproteins. In contrast, L217F and S220G mutations functioned weakly in this context. Furthermore, we demonstrated that either increasing the concentration of arsenic trioxide or combining it with ATRA could overcome the mutation-triggered arsenic resistance in vitro. In addition to presenting more evidence to reinforce the correlation of genetic mutations in PML-RARA with arsenic efficacy, we provide novel insight into the functional difference of acquired mutations of PML-RARA both in vitro and in the clinical setting. Our findings may help predict the prognosis and select more effective strategies during APL therapy.","['Liu, Jiangying', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Liu J', 'Zhu HH', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang Q', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', '*Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sumoylation/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/06/06 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30563-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-04-637678 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 14;127(2):243-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-04-637678.

The impact of comorbidity on cancer-specific mortality, taking competing risks into account, has not been evaluated. METHODS: Using the Swedish Cancer Register, we identified patients aged >18 years with a first diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, N = 2,550), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, N = 1,000) or myeloma (N = 4,584) 2002-2009. Comorbid disease history was assessed through in- and out-patient care as defined in the Charlson comorbidity index. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated through 2012 using Poisson regression. Probabilities of cancer-specific death were computed using flexible parametric survival models. RESULTS: Comorbidity was associated with increased all-cause as well as cancer-specific mortality (cancer-specific MRR: AML = 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.15-1.40; CML = 1.28, 0.96-1.70; myeloma = 1.17, 1.08-1.28) compared with patients without comorbidity. Disorders associated with higher cancer-specific mortality were renal disease (in patients with AML, CML and myeloma), cerebrovascular conditions, dementia, psychiatric disease (AML, myeloma), liver and rheumatic disease (AML), cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (myeloma). The difference in the probability of cancer-specific death, comparing patients with and without comorbidity, was largest among AML patients <70 years, whereas in myeloma the difference did not vary by age among the elderly. The probability of cancer-specific death was generally higher than other-cause death even in older age groups, irrespective of comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities associated with organ failure or cognitive function are associated with poorer prognosis in several hematological malignancies, likely due to lower treatment tolerability. The results highlight the need for a better balance between treatment toxicity and efficacy in comorbid and elderly AML, CML and myeloma patients.","['Mohammadi, Mohammad', 'Cao, Yang', 'Glimelius, Ingrid', 'Bottai, Matteo', 'Eloranta, Sandra', 'Smedby, Karin E']","['Mohammadi M', 'Cao Y', 'Glimelius I', 'Bottai M', 'Eloranta S', 'Smedby KE']","['Division of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. mohammad.mohammadi@ki.se.', 'Institute of Environmental Medicine, Unit of Biostatistics, Division of Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. yang.cao@ki.se.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

We have reported that acquired resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax) is associated with increased BCL-xL expression. Yet, how BCL-xL mediates chemoresistance in hematopoietic malignancies is not clear. This finding may help in design of new strategies for therapeutic intervention to overcome acquired chemoresistance mediated by BCL-xL. RESULTS: We now show that the increased BCL-xL expression was inversely correlated with that of miR-377 in ABT-199-resistant cells. This finding was also extended to a panel of B-cell lymphoid lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. miR-377 suppressed BCL-xL expression by recognizing two binding sites in the BCL-xL 3'-UTR. Mutation of these two miR-377 consensus-binding sites completely abolished its regulatory effect. Expression of a miR-377 mimic downregulated BCL-xL protein expression and significantly increased apoptotic cell death. Expression of a miR-377 inhibitor restored BCL-xL protein expression and limited cell death caused by the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine. Thus, miR-377-dependent BCL-xL regulation drives acquired therapeutic resistance to ABT-199. We further show that CLL patients who received a diverse array of chemotherapy regimens also had significantly higher BCL-xL and lower miR377 expression, indicating that exposure to chemotherapy might trigger transcriptional silencing of miR-377, which results in high levels of BCL-xL. Importantly, CLL patients with high BCL-xL/low miR-377 expression had an advanced tumor stage. Moreover, the high BCL-xL expression correlated with short treatment-free survival in 76 CLL patients. miR-377 is located at 14q32 in the DLK1-DIO3 region, which encodes the largest tumor suppressor miRNA cluster in humans. Examination of five additional 14q32 miRNAs revealed that the majority were significantly down-regulated in most CLL patients as well as in ABT-199-resistant cell lines. Remarkably, four of these miRNAs had significantly decreased expression in chemotherapy-treated CLL patients as compared to those untreated. These findings indicate a reduced expression of multiple miRNAs that may reflect a global silencing of this miRNA cluster in therapy-resistant lymphoid cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which down-regulation of miR-377 increases BCL-xL expression, promoting chemotherapy resistance in B-cell lymphoid malignancies.","['Al-Harbi, Sayer', 'Choudhary, Gaurav S', 'Ebron, Jey Sabith', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Vivekanathan, Nagarajavel', 'Ting, Angela H', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Smith, Mitchell R', 'Shukla, Girish C', 'Almasan, Alex']","['Al-Harbi S', 'Choudhary GS', 'Ebron JS', 'Hill BT', 'Vivekanathan N', 'Ting AH', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Smith MR', 'Shukla GC', 'Almasan A']","['Departments of Cancer Biology, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Human Cancer Genomic Research, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Cancer, Riyadh, 11211, Saudi Arabia.', 'Departments of Cancer Biology, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, 44115, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Genomic Medicine Institute, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Genomic Medicine Institute, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, 44115, USA.', 'Departments of Cancer Biology, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA. almasaa@ccf.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151104,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MIRN377 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/07/14 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-015-0460-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-015-0460-8 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Nov 4;14:185. doi: 10.1186/s12943-015-0460-8.,"['R01 CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA184137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA154356/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154356/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4632834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that increased PRMT5 activity enhanced AML growth in vitro and in vivo while PRMT5 downregulation reduced it. In AML cells, PRMT5 interacted with Sp1 in a transcription repressor complex and silenced miR-29b preferentially via dimethylation of histone 4 arginine residue H4R3. As Sp1 is also a bona fide target of miR-29b, the miR silencing resulted in increased Sp1. This event in turn led to transcription activation of FLT3, a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of PRMT5 via sh/siRNA or a first-in-class small-molecule inhibitor (HLCL-61) resulted in significantly increased expression of miR-29b and consequent suppression of Sp1 and FLT3 in AML cells. As a result, significant antileukemic activity was achieved. Collectively, our data support a novel leukemogenic mechanism in AML where PRMT5 mediates both silencing and transcription of genes that participate in a 'yin-yang' functional network supporting leukemia growth. As FLT3 is often mutated in AML and pharmacologic inhibition of PRMT5 appears feasible, the PRMT5-miR-29b-FLT3 network should be further explored as a novel therapeutic target for AML.","['Tarighat, S S', 'Santhanam, R', 'Frankhouser, D', 'Radomska, H S', 'Lai, H', 'Anghelina, M', 'Wang, H', 'Huang, X', 'Alinari, L', 'Walker, A', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Croce, C M', 'Li, L', 'Garzon, R', 'Li, C', 'Baiocchi, R A', 'Marcucci, G']","['Tarighat SS', 'Santhanam R', 'Frankhouser D', 'Radomska HS', 'Lai H', 'Anghelina M', 'Wang H', 'Huang X', 'Alinari L', 'Walker A', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Croce CM', 'Li L', 'Garzon R', 'Li C', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Marcucci G']","['Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Graduate Program, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Graduate Program, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Cancer Genetics, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Gehr Family Leukemia Center, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Gehr Family Leukemia Center, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151105,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine/*chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', '*Epigenomics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/06 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/11/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015308 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.308 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Apr;30(4):789-99. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.308.

Agents such as erlotinib used for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer or imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia, for instance, lead to rapid tumor responses. Unfortunately, however, resistance often emerges and renders these agents ineffective after a variable amount of time. The FDA-approved dosing schedules for these drugs were not designed to optimally prevent the emergence of resistance. To this end, we have previously utilized evolutionary mathematical modeling of treatment responses to elucidate the dosing schedules best able to prevent or delay the onset of resistance. Here we expand on our approaches by taking into account dose-dependent mutation rates at which resistant cells emerge. The relationship between the serum drug concentration and the rate at which resistance mutations arise can lead to non-intuitive results about the best dose administration strategies to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance. METHODS: We used mathematical modeling, available clinical trial data, and different considerations of the relationship between mutation rate and drug concentration to predict the effectiveness of different dosing strategies. RESULTS: We designed several distinct measures to interrogate the effects of different treatment dosing strategies and found that a low-dose continuous strategy coupled with high-dose pulses leads to the maximal delay until clinically observable resistance. Furthermore, the response to treatment is robust against different assumptions of the mutation rate as a function of drug concentration. CONCLUSIONS: For new and existing targeted drugs, our methodology can be employed to compare the effectiveness of different dose administration schedules and investigate the influence of changing mutation rates on outcomes.","['Liu, Lin L', 'Li, Fei', 'Pao, William', 'Michor, Franziska']","['Liu LL', 'Li F', 'Pao W', 'Michor F']","['Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.

Unlike many primary tumors, metastatic tumors cannot be cured by surgery alone. Metastatic cancer requires chemotherapy. However, metastatic cells are not easily killed by chemotherapy. These problems with chemotherapy are caused in part by the metastatic cell niche: hypoxia. Here we show that the molecule, methyl sulfone, normalized metastatic metabolism of hypoxic breast cancer and melanoma cells by altering several metabolic functions of the cells. Under hypoxia, methyl sulfone decreased expression of the master regulator of hypoxia, HIF-1alpha, and reduced levels of the glycolytic enzymes, PKM2, LDHA, GLUT1, the pro-angiogenic protein, VEGF, and the iron-sulfur metabolism molecules, miR-210 and transferrin, all of which promote metastasis. Conversely, methyl sulfone increased levels of ISCU1/2 and ferroportin, proteins associated with iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and iron homeostasis in normal cells. These data identify methyl sulfone as a multi-targeting molecule that blocks the survival/proliferative effect of hypoxia on metastatic cells and brings normality back to cellular metabolism.","['Caron, Joan McIntyre', 'Caron, Jane McIntyre']","['Caron JM', 'Caron JM']","['JMCaron, LLC, Thomaston, CT, 06787, United States of America.', 'JMCaron, LLC, Thomaston, CT, 06787, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN210 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sulfones)', '9H4PO4Z4FT (dimethyl sulfone)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology']",2015/11/05 06:00,2016/06/11 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2015/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0141565 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-33835 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 4;10(11):e0141565. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0141565. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4633041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HP-beta-CyD has recently been approved for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C disease, a lysosomal lipid storage disorder, and is used in clinical practice. Since cholesterol accumulation and/or dysregulated cholesterol metabolism has been described in various malignancies, including leukemia, we hypothesized that HP-beta-CyD itself might have anticancer effects. This study provides evidence that HP-beta-CyD inhibits leukemic cell proliferation at physiologically available doses. First, we identified the potency of HP-beta-CyD in vitro against various leukemic cell lines derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). HP-beta-CyD treatment reduced intracellular cholesterol resulting in significant leukemic cell growth inhibition through G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Intraperitoneal injection of HP-beta-CyD significantly improved survival in leukemia mouse models. Importantly, HP-beta-CyD also showed anticancer effects against CML cells expressing a T315I BCR-ABL mutation (that confers resistance to most ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors), and hypoxia-adapted CML cells that have characteristics of leukemic stem cells. In addition, colony forming ability of human primary AML and CML cells was inhibited by HP-beta-CyD. Systemic administration of HP-beta-CyD to mice had no significant adverse effects. These data suggest that HP-beta-CyD is a promising anticancer agent regardless of disease or cellular characteristics.","['Yokoo, Masako', 'Kubota, Yasushi', 'Motoyama, Keiichi', 'Higashi, Taishi', 'Taniyoshi, Masatoshi', 'Tokumaru, Hiroko', 'Nishiyama, Rena', 'Tabe, Yoko', 'Mochinaga, Sakiko', 'Sato, Akemi', 'Sueoka-Aragane, Naoko', 'Sueoka, Eisaburo', 'Arima, Hidetoshi', 'Irie, Tetsumi', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Yokoo M', 'Kubota Y', 'Motoyama K', 'Higashi T', 'Taniyoshi M', 'Tokumaru H', 'Nishiyama R', 'Tabe Y', 'Mochinaga S', 'Sato A', 'Sueoka-Aragane N', 'Sueoka E', 'Arima H', 'Irie T', 'Kimura S']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Program for Leading Graduate Schools ""HIGO (Health life science: Interdisciplinary and Global Oriented) Program"", Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Program for Leading Graduate Schools ""HIGO (Health life science: Interdisciplinary and Global Oriented) Program"", Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '1I96OHX6EK (2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/analysis/metabolism', 'Colorimetry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lung/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",2015/11/05 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0141946 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-01823 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Nov 4;10(11):e0141946. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0141946. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4633159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limited data exist on the long-term outcomes following IM discontinuation in patients treated with frontline IM therapy. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled patients with CML-CP who discontinued IM after achieving UMRD for >/=12 months between June 2009 and January 2013. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (8 male, 11 female) were included. After IM discontinuation, 14 patients (74%) lost UMRD after a median of 4.0 months. Of the 14 patients with molecular relapses, 12 (86%) relapsed within the first 9 months after IM discontinuation and 2 (14%) relapsed at 20.5 and 22.8 months, respectively. No molecular relapse was observed after 2 years of IM discontinuation. With a median follow-up of 58.1 months (range 23.0-66.5), the estimated UMRD persistence rate at 5 years was 23.7%. IM was readministered in all patients with molecular relapse, and 12 patients (86%) reachieved UMRD at a median of 5.3 months. A high-risk Sokal score, delayed UMRD achievement and short-term IM therapy were significantly associated with molecular relapse.

DCs and CIK cells were acquired from healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cocultured as an experimental group, while CIK cells were cultured alone as a control group. Cell numbers were counted by trypan blue staining, cytotoxic activity was measured by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, cell phenotypes were detected by flow cytometry, and secreted levels of INF-gamma and IL-12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proliferation activity in the experimental group was noticeably higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). Under the same conditions, the ratio of CD3(+)CD56(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) double-positive CIK cells was significantly elevated when cocultured with DCs (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the experimental group had significantly higher levels of secreted INF-gamma and IL-12 in the supernatants after 3 days (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). The antitumor effect of DC-CIK cells against leukemia cells was much higher than that of CIK cells at an effector-target ratio ranging from 2.5:1 to 20:1 (P < 0.05), and this effect was positively related to the effector-target ratio. The proliferation activity, level of secretory cytokines, and antitumor effect against AML cells of DC-CIK cells were significantly higher than in CIK cells.

The mechanism of spontaneous regression remains to be elucidated. TrkA plays an essential role in the differentiation and functionality of neurons; abundant TrkA expression is associated with favorable prognosis of neuroblastoma. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a first-line drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment, has been shown to induce differentiation and inhibit cell growth. Neuroblastoma tissues in our hospital inpatient were collected, primary cell culture was performed, and the cells were separated and purified to be cell line. Trypan blue exclusion was used to count the numbers of cells alive, morphological changes were observed under the phase-contrast microscope. RT-PCR was used to determine the expression level of TrkA. In this study, a human neuroblastoma cell line was successfully established; in addition, we demonstrated that ATRA induces growth arrest and promotes the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. In addition, ATRA was shown to significantly increase the levels of TrkA mRNA expression. Therefore, we concluded that the elevated expression of the TrkA receptor is associated with ATRA-induced growth arrest and differentiation o neuroblastoma cells.

Whether similar or related progenitors for endothelial and hematopoietic cells are present during organogenesis is unclear. Using inducible transgenic mice that specifically label endothelial and hematopoietic precursors, we performed fate-tracing studies combined with colony-forming assays and crosstransplantation studies. We identified a progenitor, marked by the expression of helix-loop-helix transcription factor stem cell leukemia (SCL/Tal1). During organogenesis of the kidney, SCL/Tal1(+) progenitors gave rise to endothelium and blood precursors with multipotential colony-forming capacity. Furthermore, appropriate morphogenesis of the kidney vasculature, including glomerular capillary development, arterial mural cell coating, and lymphatic vessel development, required sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling via the G protein-coupled S1P receptor 1 in these progenitors. Overall, these results show that SCL/Tal1(+) progenitors with hemogenic capacity originate and differentiate within the early embryonic kidney by hemovasculogenesis (the concomitant formation of blood and vessels) and underscore the importance of the S1P pathway in vascular development.","['Hu, Yan', 'Li, Minghong', 'Gothert, Joachim R', 'Gomez, R Ariel', 'Sequeira-Lopez, Maria Luisa S']","['Hu Y', 'Li M', 'Gothert JR', 'Gomez RA', 'Sequeira-Lopez ML']","['Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Department of Pediatrics and msl7u@virginia.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151103,United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,"['0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (S1pr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Vessels/*embryology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/embryology', 'Kidney/*blood supply', 'Mice', '*Organogenesis', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*physiology', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors']",2015/11/05 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2015/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ASN.2015060610 [pii]', '10.1681/ASN.2015060610 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2016 Jul;27(7):1984-95. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2015060610.

Our aim was to assess the presence, magnitude and temporal changes of WT1 expression as prognostic factors. 60 AML patients were followed until death or the end of the 6-year observation period. Blood samples were taken at diagnosis, post-induction, during remission and in case of a relapse. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we determined WT1 expression from each sample, normalized it against the endogenous control gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and classified samples as negative, moderately positive or highly positive. We divided the patients into groups based on detected WT1 expression values, illustrated overall and disease-free survival on Kaplan-Meier curves, and compared differences between each group by the logrank test. Disappearance of WT1-positivity during chemotherapy had a favorable effect on survival. Interestingly, no difference was seen between the survivals of WT1-positive subgroups that expressed moderate or high levels of WT1 mRNA. A 1-log decrease in WT1 expression without becoming negative did not affect prognosis, either. Our results suggest that defining a cut-off value for WT1-positivity, rather than just using logarithmic figures of changes in gene expression, might have prognostic use in post-induction AML patients. We encourage further, larger-scale studies.","['Ujj, Zsofia', 'Buglyo, Gergely', 'Udvardy, Miklos', 'Beyer, Daniel', 'Vargha, Gyorgy', 'Biro, Sandor', 'Rejto, Laszlo']","['Ujj Z', 'Buglyo G', 'Udvardy M', 'Beyer D', 'Vargha G', 'Biro S', 'Rejto L']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary. gbuglyo@hotmail.com.', 'Institute of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.', 'Institute of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei korut, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/05 06:00,2016/10/12 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12253-015-0002-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-015-0002-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2016 Jan;22(1):217-21. doi: 10.1007/s12253-015-0002-0.

Disseminated phaeohyphomycoses caused by rare dematiaceous molds in immunocompromised patients have a high mortality rate and are increasingly reported in the literature. Early diagnosis of disseminated phaehyphomycosis is critical especially in neutropenic patients but can be hindered by the low sensitivity of fungal blood cultures and low clinical suspicion. Cutaneous manifestations are often the earliest sign of disease and conducting a thorough skin exam in febrile neutropenic patients can lead to more rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment. PCR amplification and sequencing of mold RNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue can be useful for diagnosing rare fungal infections when negative fungal cultures preclude morphologic diagnosis.

Here we describe our preclinical work with a dual-affinity retargeting (DART) molecule generated from antibodies to CD3 and CD123, designed to redirect T cells against acute myeloid leukemia blasts. The CD3xCD123 DART (also referred to as MGD006/S80880) consists of 2 independent polypeptides, each composed of the VH of 1 antibody in tandem with the VL of the other antibody. The target antigen CD123 (interleukin 3RA) is highly and differentially expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In this study we demonstrate that the CD3xCD123 DART binds to both human CD3 and CD123 to mediate target-effector cell association, T-cell activation, proliferation, and receptor diversification. The CD3xCD123 DART also induces a dose-dependent killing of AML cell lines and primary AML blasts in vitro and in vivo. These results provide the basis for testing the CD3xCD123 DART in the treatment of patients with CD123(+) AML.","['Al-Hussaini, Muneera', 'Rettig, Michael P', 'Ritchey, Julie K', 'Karpova, Darja', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Eissenberg, Linda G', 'Gao, Feng', 'Eades, William C', 'Bonvini, Ezio', 'Chichili, Gurunadh R', 'Moore, Paul A', 'Johnson, Syd', 'Collins, Lynne', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Al-Hussaini M', 'Rettig MP', 'Ritchey JK', 'Karpova D', 'Uy GL', 'Eissenberg LG', 'Gao F', 'Eades WC', 'Bonvini E', 'Chichili GR', 'Moore PA', 'Johnson S', 'Collins L', 'DiPersio JF']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO;', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'MacroGenics, Inc., Rockville, MD; and.', 'MacroGenics, Inc., Rockville, MD; and.', 'MacroGenics, Inc., Rockville, MD; and.', 'MacroGenics, Inc., Rockville, MD; and.', 'Department of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151103,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor alpha/genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/11/05 06:00,2016/06/01 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2014/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30618-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-575704 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 7;127(1):122-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-575704.

Genetics alone cannot explain sporadic cancer and cancer development in individuals with no family history or a weak family history of cancer. Epigenetics provides a mechanism to explain the development of cancer in such situations. Alterations in epigenetic profiling may provide important insights into the etiology and natural history of cancer. Because several epigenetic changes occur before histopathological changes, they can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and risk assessment. Many cancers may remain asymptomatic until relatively late stages; in managing the disease, efforts should be focused on early detection, accurate prediction of disease progression, and frequent monitoring. This chapter describes epigenetic biomarkers as they are expressed during cancer development and their potential use in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Based on epigenomic information, biomarkers have been identified that may serve as diagnostic tools; some such biomarkers also may be useful in identifying individuals who will respond to therapy and survive longer. The importance of analytical and clinical validation of biomarkers is discussed, along with challenges and opportunities in this field.","['Verma, Mukesh']",['Verma M'],"['Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Suite# 4E102. 9609 Medical Center Drive, MSC 9763, Bethesda, MD, 20892-9726, USA. vermam@mail.nih.gov.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', '*Epigenomics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",2015/11/05 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-94-017-7215-0_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2015;867:59-80. doi: 10.1007/978-94-017-7215-0_5.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarker', 'Bladder cancer', 'Blood cancer', 'Brain cancer', 'Breast cancer', 'Cancer', 'Cancer epigenetics', 'Cervical cancer', 'Chromatin', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Diagnosis', 'Early detection', 'Endometrial cancer', 'Epigenetic inhibitors', 'Epigenetics', 'Epigenomic biomarkers', 'Gastric cancer', 'Genomic instability', 'Glioma', 'Head and neck cancer', 'Histone', 'Kidney cancer', 'Leukemia and lymphoma', 'Liver cancer', 'Lung cancer', 'Methylation', 'Ovarian cancer', 'Pancreatic cancer', 'Prognosis', 'Prostate cancer', 'Skin cancer', 'Surveillance', 'Validation', 'microRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown in DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma that PRDM1 is downregulated by cellular microRNAs. In this study, we identify the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) microRNA (miRNA), EBV-miR-BHRF1-2, as a viral miRNA regulator of PRDM1. EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 repressed luciferase reporter activity by specific interaction with the seed region within the PRDM1 3' untranslated region. EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 inhibition upregulated PRDM1 protein expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), supporting a role of miR-BHRF1-2 in PRDM1 downregulation in vivo. Discordance of PRDM1 messenger RNA and protein expressions is associated with high EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 levels in LCLs and primary post-transplant EBV-positive DLBCL. Enforced expression of PRDM1-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in LCL cells. Inhibition of EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 negatively regulates cell cycle and decreases expression of SCARNA20, a small nucleolar RNA that is also downregulated by PRDM1 overexpression. The interaction between EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 and PRDM1 may be one of the mechanisms by which EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 promotes EBV lymphomagenesis. Our results support the potential of EBV-miR-BHRF1-2 as a therapeutic target in EBV-associated lymphoma.","['Ma, J', 'Nie, K', 'Redmond, D', 'Liu, Y', 'Elemento, O', 'Knowles, D M', 'Tam, W']","['Ma J', 'Nie K', 'Redmond D', 'Liu Y', 'Elemento O', 'Knowles DM', 'Tam W']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (BHRF1 protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA, Small Nucleolar)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Nucleolar/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Viral Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2015/11/05 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2015/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015285 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.285 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):594-604. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.285.

In this paper, a novel random forests-based feature selection method is proposed that adopts the idea of stratifying feature space and combines generalised sequence backward searching and generalised sequence forward searching strategies. A random forest variable importance score is used to rank features, and different classifiers are used as a feature subset evaluating function. The proposed method is examined on five microarray expression datasets, including leukaemia, prostate, breast, nervous and DLBCL, and the average accuracies of the SVM classifier in these datasets are 100%, 95.24%, 85%, 91.67%, and 91.67%, respectively. The results show that the proposed method could not only improve the classification accuracy but also greatly reduce the computation time of the feature selection process.","['Yao, Dengju', 'Yang, Jing', 'Zhan, Xiaojuan', 'Zhan, Xiaorong', 'Xie, Zhiqiang']","['Yao D', 'Yang J', 'Zhan X', 'Zhan X', 'Xie Z']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Int J Data Min Bioinform,International journal of data mining and bioinformatics,101279469,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Support Vector Machine']",2015/11/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1504/ijdmb.2015.070852 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Data Min Bioinform. 2015;13(1):84-101. doi: 10.1504/ijdmb.2015.070852.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report that the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) panobinostat synergizes with MK-1775 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a malignancy which remains a clinical challenge and requires more effective therapies. Using both AML cell line models and primary patient samples, we demonstrated that panobinostat and MK-1775 synergistically induced proliferation arrest and cell death. We also demonstrated that panobinostat had equal anti-leukemic activities against primary AML blasts derived from patients either at initial diagnosis or at relapse. Interestingly, treatment with panobinostat alone or in combination with MK-1775 resulted in decreased Wee1 protein levels as well as downregulation of the CHK1 pathway. shRNA knockdown of CHK1 significantly sensitized AML cells to MK-1775 treatment, while knockdown of Wee1 significantly enhanced both MK-1775- and panobinostat-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate that panobinostat synergizes with MK-1775 in AML cells, at least in part through downregulation of CHK1 and/or Wee1, providing compelling evidence for the clinical development of the combination treatment in AML.","['Qi, Wenxiu', 'Zhang, Wenbo', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Chu, Roland', 'Madlambayan, Gerard J', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Wang, Zhihong', 'Wang, Yue', 'Li, Chunhuai', 'Lin, Hai', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Qi W', 'Zhang W', 'Edwards H', 'Chu R', 'Madlambayan GJ', 'Taub JW', 'Wang Z', 'Wang Y', 'Li C', 'Lin H', 'Ge Y']","['a National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine; Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering; the Ministry of Education; School of Life Sciences; Jilin University ; Changchun , China.', 'a National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine; Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering; the Ministry of Education; School of Life Sciences; Jilin University ; Changchun , China.', 'b Department of Oncology ; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', 'c Molecular Therapeutics Program; Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', 'd Department of Pediatrics ; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', ""e Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology; Children's Hospital of Michigan ; Detroit , MI USA."", 'h Department of Biological Sciences; Oakland University ; Rochester , MI USA.', 'c Molecular Therapeutics Program; Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', 'd Department of Pediatrics ; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', ""e Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology; Children's Hospital of Michigan ; Detroit , MI USA."", 'd Department of Pediatrics ; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', ""e Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology; Children's Hospital of Michigan ; Detroit , MI USA."", 'f Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; The First Hospital of Jilin University ; Cangchun , China.', 'f Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology; The First Hospital of Jilin University ; Cangchun , China.', 'g Department of Hematology and Oncology; The First Hospital of Jilin University ; Changchun , China.', 'b Department of Oncology ; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.', 'c Molecular Therapeutics Program; Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute; Wayne State University School of Medicine ; Detroit , MI USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'K2T6HJX3I3 (adavosertib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Panobinostat', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/10/21 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1095406 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(12):1784-93. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1095406.,,PMC4847803,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CHK1', 'MK-1775', 'Panobinostat', 'Wee1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These kinases catalyze phosphorylation reaction by using ATP as phosphoryl donor. Proviral Integration Site for Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (PIM) kinase encodes serine/threonine protein kinases that recognized as proto-oncogene, responsible for rapid growth of cancerous cells. It is implicated in cell survival and function via cell cycle progression and its metabolism. PIM-3, sub-member of PIM kinases is a proto-oncogene, its overexpression inhibits apoptosis, and results in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. PIM-3 is considered as a promising drug target but attempts to develop its specific inhibitors is slowed down due to the lack of 3D structure by any experimental technique. In silico techniques generally facilitate scientist to explore hidden structural features in order to improve drug discovery. In the present study, homology modeling, molecular docking and MD simulation techniques were utilized to explore the structure and dynamics of PIM-3 kinase. Induction of water molecules during molecular docking simulation explored differences in the hinge region between PIM-1 and PIM-3 kinases that may be responsible for specificity. Furthermore, role of water molecules in the active site was also explored via radial distribution function (RDF) after a 10 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Generated RDF plots exhibited the importance of water for inhibitor binding through their bridging capability that links the ligand with binding site residues.","['Ul-Haq, Zaheer', 'Gul, Sana', 'Usmani, Saman', 'Wadood, Abdul', 'Khan, Waqasuddin']","['Ul-Haq Z', 'Gul S', 'Usmani S', 'Wadood A', 'Khan W']","['Dr Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi 75270, Pakistan.

To identify new genetic events controlling senescence, we performed a small interfering RNA screening human cancer cells and identified a number of targets potentially involved in senescence of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Importantly, we showed that knockdown of RAD21 resulted in the appearance of several senescent markers, including enhanced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and heterochromatin focus formation, as well as elevated p21 protein levels and RB1 pathway activation. Further biochemical analyses revealed that RAD21 knockdown led to the downregulation of c-Myc and its targets, including CDK4, a negative regulator of RB1, and blockedRB1 phosphorylation (pRB1), and the RB1-mediated transcriptional repression of E2F. Moreover, c-Myc downregulation was partially mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation within promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, which were found to be highly abundant during RAD21 knockdown-induced senescence. Exogenous c-Myc reconstitution rescued cells from RAD21 silencing-induced senescence. Altogether, data arising from this study implicate a novel function of RAD21 in cellular senescence in MDA-MB-231 cells that is mainly dependent onRB1 pathway activation via c-Myc downregulation.","['Zhu, Shan', 'Zhao, Li', 'Li, Yueyang', 'Hou, Pingfu', 'Yao, Ruosi', 'Tan, Jiang', 'Liu, Dongxu', 'Han, Liping', 'Huang, Baiqu', 'Lu, Jun', 'Zhang, Yu']","['Zhu S', 'Zhao L', 'Li Y', 'Hou P', 'Yao R', 'Tan J', 'Liu D', 'Han L', 'Huang B', 'Lu J', 'Zhang Y']","['The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130020, China.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.', 'The University of Auckland, Grafton, Auckland, 1023, New Zealand.', 'School of Life Sciences, Changchun Normal University, Changchun, 130032, China.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151120,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RAD21 protein, human)', '0 (RB1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25426 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2016 Jun;117(6):1359-69. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25426.

Therefore, the outcomes of SCT in elderly AML patients remain poorly defined. We performed a meta-analysis of all previous articles up until September 22, 2015 of SCT in AML patients >60 years. The primary endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years. A total of 13 studies (749 patients) were included. The pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for RFS at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 62% (95% CI, 54% to 69%), 47% (95% CI, 42% to 53%), 44% (95% CI, 33% to 55%), and 35% (95% CI, 26% to 45%), respectively. The corresponding numbers for OS were 73% (95% CI, 66% to 79%), 58% (95% CI, 50% to 65%), 45% (95% CI, 35% to 54%), and 38% (95% CI, 29% to 48%), respectively. We found no evidence of publication bias in our primary endpoints, with the exception of relapse, where there appeared to be a relative lack of small studies with high relapse rates. Sensitivity analysis did not identify an overtly influential study for our primary endpoints, with 1 exception in 2-year RFS analysis. The present analysis argues against significant publication bias and demonstrates consistency among reports despite differences in patient-, disease-, center-, and transplantation-related characteristics. Our results suggest that reduced-intensity SCT is a viable treatment option for elderly AML patients with a 3-year RFS of 35% for those over the age of 60. These results argue against using age per se as the sole criterion against SCT and would help remove some of the barriers that often preclude curative intent treatment. Correct identification of patients who would benefit from SCT can improve outcomes in this frequently undertreated population.","['Rashidi, Armin', 'Ebadi, Maryam', 'Colditz, Graham A', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Rashidi A', 'Ebadi M', 'Colditz GA', 'DiPersio JF']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Program, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

We explored the impact of central nervous system (CNS) involvement on outcome of pediatric patients with ALL in Tanzania. PROCEDURE: Comprehensive chart review was performed to characterize CNS involvement, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric patients with ALL at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients with confirmed ALL had accessible data, and 128 initiated therapy. Sixteen percent of 156 patients had a documented cerebral spinal fluid analysis by cytospin. Seventy patients (45%) had a documented lumbar puncture with intrathecal (IT) therapy within 1 week of diagnosis. Thirteen patients presented with CNS involvement at diagnosis based on cytospin and/or unequivocal symptoms. Twenty-one patients (16%) experienced CNS relapse, three of whom had CNS disease at diagnosis. Median event-free survival (EFS) for all patients was 7.9 months and estimated EFS at 24 months was 31%. For the patients with CNS involvement at diagnosis, the estimated EFS at 24 months was 45%. Only three of 21 patients with CNS relapse were still alive with a median follow up of 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of CNS disease in patients with ALL in Dar es Salaam at diagnosis and relapse was higher than that reported in HIC, and overall survival was lower. Improving outcomes will require further advances including consistent CNS prophylaxis and may include targeting high-risk patients with additional IT treatments.","['Cohler, Cheryl', 'Jumanne, Shakilu', 'Kaijage, Jane', 'DuBois, Steven G', 'Scanlan, Patricia', 'Matthay, Katherine K']","['Cohler C', 'Jumanne S', 'Kaijage J', 'DuBois SG', 'Scanlan P', 'Matthay KK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF School of Medicine and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.', ""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF School of Medicine and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.', ""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF School of Medicine and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151103,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Tanzania', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25829 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Mar;63(3):458-64. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25829.

We also tried to answer the question whether simultaneous occurrence of these two polymorphisms has a clinical significance. MTHFR polymorphisms were assessed in 47 pediatric ALL patients, treated according to intensive chemotherapy for childhood ALL, ALL IC BFM 2009. Prolonged MTX elimination and higher incidence of toxicity were observed for patients with 677T-1298A haplotype. On the other hand, occurrence of 677C-1298A haplotype had protective effect on MTX clearance and toxicity, that was not observed in carriers of 677C-1298C haplotype. In patients with coexistence of studied variants 677CT/1298AC heterozygotes as well as in 677TT/1298AA homozygotes more frequently toxicity incidents were noted. The obtained results suggest that occurrence of 677T allele and coexistence of 677T and 1298C alleles may be associated with lower MTX clearance and elevated risk of adverse effects during MTX-treatment of pediatric ALL patients.","['Kaluzna, Ewelina', 'Strauss, Ewa', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Gowin, Ewelina', 'Swiatek-Koscielna, Bogna', 'Nowak, Jerzy', 'Fichna, Marta', 'Mankowski, Przemyslaw', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta']","['Kaluzna E', 'Strauss E', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Gowin E', 'Swiatek-Koscielna B', 'Nowak J', 'Fichna M', 'Mankowski P', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D']","['Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland; Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Laboratory for Basic Research and Translational Medicine, Clinic of Internal and Vascular Surgery, Dluga 1/2, 61-848 Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Szpitalna 27/33, 60-572 Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Family Medicine Department, Przybyszewskiego 49, 60-355 Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Department of Paediatric Surgery Traumatology and Urology, Szpitalna 27/33, 60-572 Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland; Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Szpitalna 27/33, 60-572 Poznan, Poland; Department of Medical Diagnostics, Dobra 38a, 60-595 Poznan, Poland.

METHODS: We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the impact of ATG in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by a matched 10 of 10 unrelated donor transplant from BM or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Our study included 356 patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide associated with fractionated total body irradiation or busulfan. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17.6 months (range, 0-156). The ATG and PBSCs were the only variables that independently decreased the cumulative incidence (CI) of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (hazards ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.21-0.73; P < 0.01; and HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.90; P = 0.02, respectively). The ATG had no impact on overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality. In the PBSC group (n = 139), ATG was associated with a lower CI of both grades III to IV acute GvHD (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.91; P = 0.04), chronic GvHD (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.87; P = 0.03), and GvHD-free/relapse-free survival (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-0.80; P < 0.01), whereas these correlations were not significant in the group of patients (n = 217) receiving BM (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.11-1.93; P = 0.06 for grade III-IV acute GvHD; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.22-1.06; P = 0.08 for chronic GvHD; and HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46-1.01; P = 0.06 for GvHD-free/relapse-free survival). CONCLUSIONS: Although our results confirm the recommendation for ATG to be added after PBSC transplantation, no obvious benefit was identified using this approach in the setting of BM transplantation. Only prospective studies may yield definitive answers to this question.","['Ravinet, Aurelie', 'Cabrespine, Aurelie', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Yakoub Agha, Ibrahim', 'Nguyen, Stephanie', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Menard, Anne Lise', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Marchand, Tony', 'Deteix, Clemence', 'Cassuto, Jill Patrice', 'Maury, Sebastien', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Peffault de Latour, Regis', 'Bay, Jacques Olivier']","['Ravinet A', 'Cabrespine A', 'Socie G', 'Milpied N', 'Yakoub Agha I', 'Nguyen S', 'Michallet M', 'Menard AL', 'Maillard N', 'Mohty M', 'Suarez F', 'Huynh A', 'Marchand T', 'Deteix C', 'Cassuto JP', 'Maury S', 'Chevallier P', 'Reman O', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Bay JO']","[""1 Service d'hematologie Clinique Adulte et de Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Estaing, Clermont Ferrand, France.2 Clermont Universite, Universite d'Auvergne, Clermont Ferrand, France.3 Hematologie/Transplantation, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.4 University Hospital and University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.5 CHRU de Lille, France.6 Service d'Hematologie Goupe hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.7 Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.8 Service d'hematologie, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.9 Service d'oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.10 Hopital Saint-Antoine, APHP, Paris, France.11 Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.12 INSERM, Paris, France.13 Hopital Necker, Paris, France.14 Hopital Purpan CHU Toulouse, France.15 Department of Clinical Hematology, Rennes University Hospital, Rennes, F-35043, France.16 INSERM UMR 917, Rennes1 University, Rennes, France.17 Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Grenoble, France.18 CHU de Nice, Nice, France.19 Department of Hematology, AP-HP, Henri Mondor Hospital, France.20 University Paris Est Creteil (UPEC) Center for Clinical Investigation in Biotherapy, Creteil, France.21 CHU Hotel Dieu Nantes, France.22 CHU Caen, France.""]",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/mortality', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'France', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/immunology/mortality/*surgery', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",2015/11/04 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/TP.0000000000000976 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2016 Aug;100(8):1732-9. doi: 10.1097/TP.0000000000000976.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression levels of GR promoters were increased by cAMP and glucocorticoid signaling, but GR protein expression was little changed in CEM and decreased in MM.1 cells. Stimulation of these two signaling pathways induced Bim in CEM cells, induced Bad in MM.1 cells, and activated Bad, as indicated by its dephosphorylation on ser112, in both cell types. This study shows that leukemic and multiple myeloma cells, including those resistant to glucocorticoids, can be induced to undergo apoptosis by stimulating the cAMP signaling pathway, with enhancement by glucocorticoids, and the mechanism by which this occurs may be related to changes in Bim and Bad expression, and in all cases, to activation of Bad.","['Dong, Hongli', 'Carlton, Michael E', 'Lerner, Adam', 'Epstein, Paul M']","['Dong H', 'Carlton ME', 'Lerner A', 'Epstein PM']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington CT, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington CT, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151013,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,2015/11/04 06:00,2015/11/04 06:01,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2015.00230 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2015 Oct 13;6:230. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2015.00230. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4602131,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bad', 'Bim', 'cAMP signaling', 'glucocorticoid receptors', 'glucocorticoid signaling', 'leukemia', 'multiple myeloma', 'phosphodiesterases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous observational studies suggest that allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) may improve overall survival (OS) because of lower rates of relapse. We sought to prospectively determine the value of HSCT for older patients with AML in first complete remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter phase II study to assess the efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT for patients between the ages of 60 and 74 years with AML in first complete remission. The primary end point was disease-free survival at 2 years after HSCT. Secondary end points included nonrelapse mortality (NRM), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, and OS. RESULTS: In all, 114 patients with a median age of 65 years received transplantations. The majority (52%) received transplantations from unrelated donors and were given antithymocyte globulin for GVHD prophylaxis. Disease-free survival and OS at 2 years after transplantation were 42% (95% CI, 33% to 52%) and 48% (95% CI, 39% to 58%), respectively, for the entire group and 40% (95% CI, 29% to 55%) and 50% (95% CI, 38% to 64%) for the unrelated donor group. NRM at 2 years was 15% (95% CI, 8% to 21%). Grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD occurred in 9.6% (95% CI, 4% to 15%) of patients, and chronic GVHD occurred in 28% (95% CI, 19% to 36%) of patients. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 44% (95% CI, 35% to 53%). CONCLUSION: Reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT to maintain remission in selected older patients with AML is relatively well tolerated and appears to provide superior outcomes when compared with historical patients treated without HSCT. GVHD and NRM rates were lower than expected. Future transplantation studies in these patients should focus on further reducing the risk of relapse.","['Devine, Steven M', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Blum, William', 'Mulkey, Flora', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Hsu, Jack W', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Slack, James', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Hars, Vera', 'Sibley, Alexander B', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Carter, Shelly', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Linker, Charles', 'Alyea, Edwin P']","['Devine SM', 'Owzar K', 'Blum W', 'Mulkey F', 'Stone RM', 'Hsu JW', 'Champlin RE', 'Chen YB', 'Vij R', 'Slack J', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Larson RA', 'Shea TC', 'Hars V', 'Sibley AB', 'Giralt S', 'Carter S', 'Horowitz MM', 'Linker C', 'Alyea EP']","['Steven M.

Its deregulation is linked to various human diseases, including diabetes, acute myeloid leukaemia and cardiovascular diseases. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch (Itchy homologue) polyubiquitinates TXNIP to promote its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and this Itch-mediated polyubiquitination of TXNIP is dependent on the interaction of the four WW domains of Itch with the two PPxY motifs of TXNIP. However, the molecular mechanism of this interaction of TXNIP with Itch remains elusive. In the present study, we found that each of the four WW domains of Itch exhibited different binding affinities for TXNIP, whereas multivalent engagement between the four WW domains of Itch and the two PPxY motifs of TXNIP resulted in their strong binding avidity. Our structural analyses demonstrated that the third and fourth WW domains of Itch were able to recognize both PPxY motifs of TXNIP simultaneously, supporting a multivalent binding mode between Itch and TXNIP. Interestingly, the phosphorylation status on the tyrosine residue of the PPxY motifs of TXNIP serves as a molecular switch in its choice of binding partners and thereby downstream biological signalling outcomes. Phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue of TXNIP diminished the binding capability of PPxY motifs of TXNIP to Itch, whereas this phosphorylation is a prerequisite to the binding activity of TXNIP to SHP2 [SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2] and their roles in stabilizing the phosphorylation and activation of CSK (c-Src tyrosine kinase).","['Liu, Yanli', 'Lau, Johnathan', 'Li, Weiguo', 'Tempel, Wolfram', 'Li, Li', 'Dong, Aiping', 'Narula, Ashrut', 'Qin, Su', 'Min, Jinrong']","['Liu Y', 'Lau J', 'Li W', 'Tempel W', 'Li L', 'Dong A', 'Narula A', 'Qin S', 'Min J']","['Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan 430079, P.R.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 277 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AML treated intensively at the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University from 2002 to 2009. Pretreatment comorbidities were identified by ICD-9 codes and chart review. Comorbidity burden (modified Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]) and specific conditions were analyzed individually. Outcomes were overall survival (OS), remission, and 30-day mortality. Covariates included age, gender, cytogenetic characteristics, hemoglobin, white cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, body mass index, and insurance type. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate OS; logistic regression was used for remission and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: In this series, 144 patients were >/= 60 years old (median age 70 years, median survival 8.7 months) and 133 were <60 years (median age 47 years, median survival 23.1 months). Older patients had a higher comorbidity burden (CCI>/=1 58% versus 26%, P<0.001). Prevalent comorbid conditions differed by age (diabetes 19.2% versus 7.5%; cardiovascular disease 12.5% versus 4.5%, for older versus younger patients, respectively). The CCI was not independently associated with OS or 30-day mortality in either age group. Among older patients, diabetes was associated with higher 30-day mortality (33.3% vs. 12.0% in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients, p=0.006). Controlling for age, cytogenetic characteristics and other comorbidities, the presence of diabetes increased the odds of 30-day mortality by 4.9 (CI 1.6-15.2) times. DISCUSSION: Diabetes is adversely associated with 30-day survival in older AML patients receiving intensive therapy.","['Tawfik, Bernard', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Isom, Scott', 'Sliesoraitis, Sarunas', 'Winter, Allison', 'Lawrence, Julia', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Klepin, Heidi D']","['Tawfik B', 'Pardee TS', 'Isom S', 'Sliesoraitis S', 'Winter A', 'Lawrence J', 'Powell BL', 'Klepin HD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Biostatistics, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.

The Windscale fire (1957) and the Chernobyl accident (1986) caused alterations to the human birth sex ratio at national levels across Europe, and childhood cancer and childhood leukemia are consistently elevated near nuclear power plants.

Nevertheless relapse are the leading cause of death following allo-HSCT. The genetic pathogenesis of relapse following allo-HSCT in Philadelphia chromosome- negative ALL (Ph- ALL) remains unexplored. We performed longitudinal whole-exome sequencing analysis in three adult patients with Ph- B-cell ALL (Ph- B-ALL) on samples collected from diagnosis to relapse after allo-HSCT. Based on these data, we performed target gene sequencing on 23 selected genes in 58 adult patients undergoing allo-HSCT with Ph- B-ALL. Our results revealed a significant enrichment of mutations in epigenetic regulators from relapsed samples, with recurrent somatic mutations in SETD2, CREBBP, KDM6A and NR3C1. The relapsed samples were also enriched in signaling factor mutations, including KRAS, PTPN21, MYC and USP54. Furthermore, we are the first to reveal the clonal evolution patterns during leukemia relapse after allo-HSCT. Cells present in relapsed specimens were genetically related to the diagnosed tumor, these cells therefore arose from either an existing subclone that was not eradicated by allo-HSCT therapy, or from the same progenitor that acquired new mutations. In some cases, however, it is possible that leukemia recurrence following allo-HSCT could result from a secondary malignancy with a distinct set of mutations. We identified novel genetic causes of leukemia relapse after allo-HSCT using the largest generated data set to date from adult patients with Ph- B-ALL.","['Xiao, Haowen', 'Wang, Li-Mengmeng', 'Luo, Yi', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Li, Caihua', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Fu, Shan', 'Wang, Yebo', 'Zhu, Ni', 'He, Jingsong', 'Zheng, Weiyan', 'Yu, Xiaohong', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Huang, He']","['Xiao H', 'Wang LM', 'Luo Y', 'Lai X', 'Li C', 'Shi J', 'Tan Y', 'Fu S', 'Wang Y', 'Zhu N', 'He J', 'Zheng W', 'Yu X', 'Cai Z', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command (Guangzhou Liuhuaqiao Hospital), Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Center for Genetic and Genomic Analysis, Genesky Biotechnologies Inc., Shanghai, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/11/12 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['6259 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6259 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jan 19;7(3):2696-708. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6259.,,PMC4823065,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'epigenetic regulators', 'mutation', 'relapse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lead SNP was found to occur on chromosome 9p21.3, a region that is deleted in 30% of childhood ALLs, suggesting the presence of causal polymorphisms linked to ALL risk. We used SNP genotyping and imputation-based fine-mapping of a multiethnic ALL case-control population (Ncases = 1,464, Ncontrols = 3,279) to identify variants of large effect within 9p21.3. We identified a CDKN2A missense variant (rs3731249) with 2% allele frequency in controls that confers three-fold increased risk of ALL in children of European ancestry (OR, 2.99; P = 1.51 x 10(-9)) and Hispanic children (OR, 2.77; P = 3.78 x 10(-4)). Moreover, of 17 patients whose tumors displayed allelic imbalance at CDKN2A, 14 preferentially retained the risk allele and lost the protective allele (PBinomial = 0.006), suggesting that the risk allele provides a selective advantage during tumor growth. Notably, the CDKN2A variant was not significantly associated with melanoma, glioblastoma, or pancreatic cancer risk, implying that this polymorphism specifically confers ALL risk but not general cancer risk. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that coding polymorphisms of large effect can underlie GWAS ""hits"" and that inherited polymorphisms may undergo directional selection during clonal expansion of tumors.","['Walsh, Kyle M', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Smirnov, Ivan V', 'Gonseth, Semira', 'Endicott, Alyson A', 'Xiao, Jianqiao', 'Rice, Terri', 'Fu, Cecilia H', 'McCoy, Lucie S', 'Lachance, Daniel H', 'Eckel-Passow, Jeanette E', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Jenkins, Robert B', 'Wrensch, Margaret R', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Walsh KM', 'de Smith AJ', 'Hansen HM', 'Smirnov IV', 'Gonseth S', 'Endicott AA', 'Xiao J', 'Rice T', 'Fu CH', 'McCoy LS', 'Lachance DH', 'Eckel-Passow JE', 'Wiencke JK', 'Jenkins RB', 'Wrensch MR', 'Ma X', 'Metayer C', 'Wiemels JL']","['Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California. kyle.walsh@ucsf.edu.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.

Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a key component of the ATR-dependent DNA damage response pathway that protects cells from RS by preventing replication fork collapse and activating homologous DNA repair. Taking this knowledge into account, one would predict CHK1 behaves strictly as a tumor suppressor. However, the reality seems far more complex. CHEK1 loss-of-function mutations have not been found in human tumors, and transgenic expression of Chek1 in mice promotes oncogene-induced transformation through RS inhibition. Moreover, CHK1 is overexpressed in various human cancers and CHK1 inhibitors have been developed as sensitizers to enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA damage-inducing chemotherapies. Here, we summarize the literature on the involvement of CHK1 in cancer progression, including our recent observation that CHK1 sustains T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell viability. We also debate the importance of identifying patients that could benefit the most from treatment with CHK1 inhibitors, taking T-ALL as a model, and propose possible markers of therapeutic response.","['Sarmento, Leonor M', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Sarmento LM', 'Barata JT']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

The adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is a promising new approach for treatment of hematological malignancies. However, preclinical reports of targeting T-cell lymphoma with CARs are almost non-existent. Here we have designed a CAR, CD4CAR, which redirects the antigen specificity of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells to CD4-expressing cells. CD4CAR T cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cord blood effectively redirected T-cell specificity against CD4+ cells in vitro. CD4CAR T cells efficiently eliminated a CD4+ leukemic cell line and primary CD4+ PTCL patient samples in co-culture assays. Notably, CD4CAR T cells maintained a central memory stem cell-like phenotype (CD8+CD45RO+CD62L+) under standard culture conditions. Furthermore, in aggressive orthotropic T-cell lymphoma models, CD4CAR T cells efficiently suppressed the growth of lymphoma cells while also significantly prolonging mouse survival. Combined, these studies demonstrate that CD4CAR-expressing CD8+ T cells are efficacious in ablating malignant CD4+ populations, with potential use as a bridge to transplant or stand-alone therapy for the treatment of PTCLs.","['Pinz, K', 'Liu, H', 'Golightly, M', 'Jares, A', 'Lan, F', 'Zieve, G W', 'Hagag, N', 'Schuster, M', 'Firor, A E', 'Jiang, X', 'Ma, Y']","['Pinz K', 'Liu H', 'Golightly M', 'Jares A', 'Lan F', 'Zieve GW', 'Hagag N', 'Schuster M', 'Firor AE', 'Jiang X', 'Ma Y']","['R and D, iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'R and D, iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'R and D, iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'R and D, iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'R and D, iCell Gene Therapeutics LLC, Long Island High Technology Incubator, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'The Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151103,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Artificial)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Engineering', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Receptors, Artificial/*genetics/immunology', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015311 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.311 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):701-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.311.

Furthermore, complete remission was not significantly associated with the outcome of the MAF/MAFB (MF) subgroup or HiR cases. HiR cases were enriched in the MF, MS and proliferation subgroups, but the poor outcome of these groups was not linked to subgroup-specific characteristics such as MAF overexpression per se.

Doxorubicin is an active cytotoxic agent for breast cancer treatment, but the acquisition of doxorubicin resistance is a common and critical limitation to cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-193b mediated the resistance of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin by targeting myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1). In this study, we found that miR-193b levels were significantly lower in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/DOXR) cells than in the parental MCF-7 cells. We observed that exogenous miR-193b significantly suppressed the ability of MCF-7/DOXR cells to resist doxorubicin. It demonstrated that miR-193b directly targeted MCL-1 3'-UTR (3'-Untranslated Regions). Further studies indicated that miR-193b sensitized MCF-7/DOXR cells to doxorubicin through a mechanism involving the downregulation of MCL-1. Together, our findings provide evidence that the modulation of miR-193b may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.","['Long, Jingpei', 'Ji, Zhiwei', 'Jiang, Kai', 'Wang, Zhaoyang', 'Meng, Guanmin']","['Long J', 'Ji Z', 'Jiang K', 'Wang Z', 'Meng G']","[""Department of Surgery, The Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310006, China."", 'School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 201804, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, 234 Gucui Road, Hangzhou 310012, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Xinhua Hospital, School of Medicine, Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200092, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, 234 Gucui Road, Hangzhou 310012, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151007,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells/drug effects', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/373574 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:373574. doi: 10.1155/2015/373574.

The treatment of AML continues to face greater challenges. An abnormal haematopoietic niche with high adhesion and proliferation might be the root cause of resistance and relapse. Most leukaemia cells are stored in the endosteal niche and recess in the G0 phase, and they are not sensitive to varieties of radiotherapies and chemotherapies. G-CSF and AMD3100 are increasingly used in priming chemotherapy. G-CSF can promote leukaemia cells to the cell cycle, which improves the complete remission rate of leukaemia patients. AMD3100, the novel CXCR4 antagonist, could also potentially promote leukaemia cells to cell cycle and improve the susceptibility of leukaemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The combination of them enhances anti-leukaemia effect. So in this review, we explore the function of G-CSF and/or AMD3100 in the priming chemotherapy of haematological malignants.","['Shen, Zhao-Hua', 'Zeng, Dong-Feng', 'Ma, Ying-Ying', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Kong, Pei-Yan']","['Shen ZH', 'Zeng DF', 'Ma YY', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang C', 'Kong PY']","[""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China. peiyankong@aliyun.com.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151102,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benzylamines', 'Cyclams', '*Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', '*Heterocyclic Compounds', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/08/09 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-015-0705-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-015-0705-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2015 Dec;32(12):262. doi: 10.1007/s12032-015-0705-9.

This burden can be estimated with the metric 'years of life lost' (YLL), which combines overall mortality and age at death. METHODS: Using United Kingdom data from 2010, we compared research funding from the National Cancer Research Institute to this YLL burden metric for 26 types of cancers in order to identify the discrepancies between cancer research funding allocation and societal burden. We also compared these values to United States data from 2010 and United Kingdom data published in 2005. RESULTS: Our study revealed a number of discrepancies between cancer research funding and burden. Some cancers are funded at levels far higher than their relative burden suggests (testicular, leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, cervical, ovarian, prostate) while other cancers appear under-funded (gallbladder, lung, nasopharyngeal, intestine, stomach, pancreatic, thyroid, oesophageal, liver, kidney, bladder, and brain/central nervous system). United Kingdom funding patterns over the past decade have generally moved to increase funding to previously under-funded cancers with one notable exception showing a converse trend (breast cancer). The broad relationship between United Kingdom and United States funding patterns is similar with a few exceptions (e.g. leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, testicular cancer). CONCLUSIONS: There are discrepancies between cancer research funding allocation and societal burden in the United Kingdom. These discrepancies are broadly similar in both the United Kingdom and the United States and, while they appear to be improving, this is not consistent across all types of cancer.","['Carter, Ashley J R', 'Delarosa, Beverly', 'Hur, Hannah']","['Carter AJ', 'Delarosa B', 'Hur H']","['Biological Sciences Department, California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, CA, 90804, USA. ashley.carter@aya.yale.edu.', 'Biological Sciences Department, California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, CA, 90804, USA. beverlyfdelarosa@gmail.com.', 'Biological Sciences Department, California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, CA, 90804, USA. hannah052292@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20151102,England,Health Res Policy Syst,Health research policy and systems,101170481,['Testicular Germ Cell Tumor'],IM,"['Biomedical Research/*economics', '*Cost of Illness', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal', '*Research Support as Topic', '*Testicular Neoplasms', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12961-015-0050-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12961-015-0050-7 [pii]']",epublish,Health Res Policy Syst. 2015 Nov 2;13:62. doi: 10.1186/s12961-015-0050-7.,,PMC4629288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MiRNAs have been shown to be aberrantly expressed in CN-AML. In addition, specific miRNA (miR) expression patterns were found to be associated with certain genetic alterations in these patients. This study investigated the expression level of miR-1, miR-486, and let-7a in 45 CN-AML patients well characterized for FLT3 and/or NPM1 mutations using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and evaluated the association between candidate miRs expression and clinical features. Our data revealed that miR-1 was significantly overexpressed in CN-AML patients, and increasing expression of miR-1 correlated with NPM1 mutation (P < 0.05) and lower hemoglobin level was also observed in patients with miR-1 overexpression (P < 0.05). The expression of miR-1 was much higher in AML-M2 compared with other subtypes. Further, we found significantly increasing miR-486 expression in 40 of 45 (89 %) CN-AML patients. There was no significant association of upregulation of miR-486 with clinical parameters. The expression level of miR-486 was increased in AML-M2 subtype. The levels of let-7a were significantly increased in CN-AML patients compared to the healthy control and significantly higher in the NPM1 +/- CN-AML patients. There was no correlation detected between the level of let-7a and FLT3+. An increasing expression level of let-7a was demonstrated in M2 subtype. In addition, our data showed no significant association between increasing let-7a and clinical characteristic. Comparison of peripheral blood and bone marrow results in 30 CN-AML patients showed that there is a considerable concordance between PB and BM in the results of candidate miR levels (P < 0.001). In conclusion, further studies should also be performed to detect functional mechanism of these miRs.","['Seyyedi, Samaneh Sadat', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Ajami, Monireh', 'Ajami, Mansoureh', 'Pourbeyranvand, Shahram', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Akrami, Seyed Mohammad']","['Seyyedi SS', 'Soleimani M', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Ajami M', 'Ajami M', 'Pourbeyranvand S', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Akrami SM']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, International Campus (TUMS-IC), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. akramism@tums.ac.ir.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151102,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (MIRN1 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN486 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2015/11/04 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4289-y [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4289-y [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Apr;37(4):4841-7. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4289-y.

Our study included 446 patients with APL from CALGB 9710, and 1,648 patients between 18 and 60 years of age with non-APL AML from CALGB 9621, 10503, and 19808. Obesity was defined as BMI >/=30 kg/m(2). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression models were fitted for DFS and OS. Obesity was seen in 50% and 38% of APL and non-APL AML patients, respectively. In APL patients, obesity was associated with worse DFS (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.03-2.27; P = 0.04) and OS (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.15-2.58; P = 0.01) after adjusting for age, sex, performance status, race, ethnicity, treatment arm and baseline white blood cell count.

Posaconazole was better than fluconazole (odds ratio [OR], 0.35 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 0.73]) and itraconazole capsule (OR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.97]), but not voriconazole (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.43 to 4.01]), in preventing IFIs. Posaconazole significantly reduced all-cause deaths, compared to placebo, fluconazole, and itraconazole solution (OR, 0.49 to 0.54 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.88]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for itraconazole solution was lower than that for posaconazole (Singapore dollars [SGD] 12,546 versus SGD 26,817 per IFI avoided and SGD 5,844 versus SGD 12,423 per LY saved) for transplant patients. For leukemia patients, itraconazole solution was the dominant strategy. Voriconazole was dominated by posaconazole. All triazole antifungals except itraconazole capsule were effective in preventing IFIs. Posaconazole was more efficacious in reducing IFIs and all-cause deaths than were fluconazole and itraconazole. Both itraconazole solution and posaconazole were cost-effective in the Singapore health care setting.","['Zhao, Ying Jiao', 'Khoo, Ai Leng', 'Tan, Gloria', 'Teng, Monica', 'Tee, Caroline', 'Tan, Ban Hock', 'Ong, Benjamin', 'Lim, Boon Peng', 'Chai, Louis Yi Ann']","['Zhao YJ', 'Khoo AL', 'Tan G', 'Teng M', 'Tee C', 'Tan BH', 'Ong B', 'Lim BP', 'Chai LY']","['Pharmacy and Therapeutics Office, Group Corporate Development, National Healthcare Group, Singapore.', 'Pharmacy and Therapeutics Office, Group Corporate Development, National Healthcare Group, Singapore ai_leng_khoo@nhg.com.sg.', 'Pharmacoeconomics and Drug Utilisation, Health Products Regulation Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore.', 'Pharmacy and Therapeutics Office, Group Corporate Development, National Healthcare Group, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National University Health System, Singapore.', 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Pharmacoeconomics and Drug Utilisation, Health Products Regulation Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore.', 'Pharmacy and Therapeutics Office, Group Corporate Development, National Healthcare Group, Singapore.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University Medicine Cluster, National University Health System, Singapore.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151102,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/drug effects/growth & development', 'Candida/drug effects/growth & development', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/economics/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics/mortality', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/economics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*economics/microbiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/*economics/microbiology/mortality', 'Singapore', 'Survival Analysis', 'Triazoles/economics/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole/economics/therapeutic use']",2015/11/04 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.01985-15 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01985-15 [doi]']",epublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Nov 2;60(1):376-86. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01985-15.

Since the FDA approval of rituximab in 1997, several novel strategies that harness the ability of T cells to target cancer cells have emerged. Reflecting on the promising clinical efficacy of these novel immunotherapy approaches, the FDA has recently granted 'breakthrough' designation to three novel treatments with distinct mechanisms. First, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy is promising for the treatment of adult and paediatric relapsed and/or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Second, blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE((R))) antibody, is now approved for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia-chromosome-negative relapsed and/or refractory B-precursor ALL. Finally, the monoclonal antibody nivolumab, which targets the PD-1 immune-checkpoint receptor with high affinity, is used for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma following treatment failure with autologous-stem-cell transplantation and brentuximab vedotin. Herein, we review the background and development of these three distinct immunotherapy platforms, address the scientific advances in understanding the mechanism of action of each therapy, and assess the current clinical knowledge of their efficacy and safety. We also discuss future strategies to improve these immunotherapies through enhanced engineering, biomarker selection, and mechanism-based combination regimens.","['Batlevi, Connie Lee', 'Matsuki, Eri', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'Younes, Anas']","['Batlevi CL', 'Matsuki E', 'Brentjens RJ', 'Younes A']","['Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 330, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 330, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 330, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 330, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151103,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), prognostic risk classification based on cytogenetics has been established, while there is a clinical heterogeneity in the intermediate risk group, particularly in those with cytogenetically normal AML. The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommended a novel risk classification system based on the cytogenetic and genetic status. The long-term prognosis according to the ELN classification system was retrospectively evaluated in two well-established cohorts, and both analyses demonstrated that the ELN system is useful for further risk stratification of younger adult patients with CN-AML.

Alternative splicing events not only happen in the normal gene regulation process, but are also closely related to certain diseases, including cancer. In this review, we briefly demonstrate the proof of concept (POC) of the relationship between alternative splicing and DNA damage, and describe the associations among alternative splicing and cancer pathogenesis, DNA damage, and gastrointestinal cancers. We discuss whether alternative splicing leads to genetic instability, which is considered to be a driving force for tumorigenesis. FUSE-binding protein (FBP) -interacting repressor (FIR) is a c-myc transcriptional suppressor. A splice variant of FIR that lacks exon 2 in the transcriptional repressor domain (FIRDeltaexon2), upregulates c-myc transcription by inactivating wild-type FIR. FIR+/- mice exhibited marked c-myc mRNA upregulation, particularly in the peripheral blood (PB), without any significant pathogenic phenotype. Because the single knockout of TP53 generates thymic lymphoma, FIR+/-TP53-/- mice developed T-cell type acute lymphocytic/lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with increased organ or bone marrow invasion and showed a poor prognosis. After describing the POC of alternative splicing of FIR in DNA damage and carcinogenesis, clinical application for cancer diagnosis and treatment by FIR/FIRDeltaexon2 was briefly summarized. Chiba University has prepared a biobank to support studies to develop biomarker detection, molecular diagnosis, and ""Omics"" research. In conclusion, alternative splicing of FIR, generating FIRDeltaexon2, potentially contributes to not only colorectal carcinogenesis, but also leukemogenesis, and a better understanding of the role and mechanism of alternative splicing in tumorigenesis may reveal new directions for cancer biomarker detection.","['Matsushita, Kazuyuki', 'Itoga, Sakae', 'Nishimura, Motoi', 'Furuta, Koh', 'Nomura, Fumio']","['Matsushita K', 'Itoga S', 'Nishimura M', 'Furuta K', 'Nomura F']",,,['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Voriconazole has been associated with periostitis, exostoses, and fluoride excess in patients after solid organ transplantation, HSCT, and leukemia therapy. The aims of this study were to describe the frequency and clinical presentation of patients presenting with pain and fluoride excess among allogeneic HSCT patients taking voriconazole, to identify when a plasma fluoride concentration was measured with respect to voriconazole initiation and onset of pain, and to describe the outcomes of patients with fluoride excess in the setting of HSCT. A retrospective review was conducted of all adult allogeneic HSCT patients receiving voriconazole at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between January 1, 2009 and July 31, 2012. Of 242 patients included, 32 had plasma fluoride measured to explore the etiology of musculoskeletal pain. In 31 patients with fluoride measurement while on voriconazole, 29 (93.5%) had elevated levels. The median plasma fluoride was 11.1 mumol/L (range, 2.4 to 24.7). The median duration of voriconazole was 163 days (range, 2 to 1327). The median time to fluoride measurement was 128 days after voriconazole initiation (range, 28 to 692). At 1 year after the start of voriconazole after HSCT, 15.3% of patients had developed pain associated with voriconazole use and 35.7% developed pain while on voriconazole after 2 years. Of the patients with an elevated fluoride level, 22 discontinued voriconazole; pain resolved or improved in 15, stabilized in 3, and worsened in 4 patients. Ten patients continued voriconazole; pain resolved or improved in 7, was attributable to alternative causes in 2, and undefined in 1.

This study aimed to examine the effects of PUMA in METH-induced neuronal apoptosis. We determined PUMA protein expression in PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y cells after METH exposure using western blot. We also observed the effect of METH on neuronal apoptosis after silencing PUMA expression with siRNA using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Additionally, to investigate possible mechanisms of METH-induced PUMA-mediated neuronal apoptosis, we measured the protein expression of apoptotic markers, including cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, Bax, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cytochrome c (cyto c), after METH treatment with or without PUMA knockdown. Results showed that METH exposure induced cell apoptosis, increased PUMA protein levels, activated caspase-3 and PARP, elevated Bax and reduced Bcl-2 expression, as well as increased the release of cyto c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm in both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells. All these effects were attenuated or reversed after silencing PUMA. A schematic depicting the role of PUMA in METH-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was proposed. Our results suggest that PUMA plays an important role in METH-triggered apoptosis and it may be a potential target for ameliorating neuronal injury and apoptosis caused by METH.","['Chen, Chuanxiang', 'Qincao, Litao', 'Xu, Jingtao', 'Du, Sihao', 'Huang, Enping', 'Liu, Chao', 'Lin, Zhoumeng', 'Xie, Wei-Bing', 'Wang, Huijun']","['Chen C', 'Qincao L', 'Xu J', 'Du S', 'Huang E', 'Liu C', 'Lin Z', 'Xie WB', 'Wang H']","[""Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medical Science, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medical Science, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medical Science, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medical Science, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medical Science, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangzhou Forensic Science Institute, Guangzhou 510030, People's Republic of China."", 'Institute of Computational Comparative Medicine, Department of Anatomy and Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.', ""Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medical Science, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.

Despite strong evolutionary conservation of the invariant TCR-alpha chain and restricting molecule MR1, this population is rare in laboratory mouse strains ( approximately 0.1% in lymphoid organs), and lack of an appropriate mouse model has hampered the study of MAIT biology. Herein, we show that MAITs are 20 times more frequent in clean wild-derived inbred CAST/EiJ mice than in C57BL/6J mice. Increased MAIT frequency was linked to one CAST genetic trait that mapped to the TCR-alpha locus and led to higher usage of the distal Valpha segments, including Valpha19. We generated a MAIThi congenic strain that was then crossed to a transgenic Rorcgt-GFP reporter strain. Using this tool, we characterized polyclonal mouse MAITs as memory (CD44+) CD4-CD8lo/neg T cells with tissue-homing properties (CCR6+CCR7-). Similar to human MAITs, mouse MAITs expressed the cytokine receptors IL-7R, IL-18Ralpha, and IL-12Rbeta and the transcription factors promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (RORgammat). Mouse MAITs produced Th1/2/17 cytokines upon TCR stimulation and recognized a bacterial compound in an MR1-dependent manner. During experimental urinary tract infection, MAITs migrated to the bladder and decreased bacterial load. Our study demonstrates that the MAIThi congenic strain allows phenotypic and functional characterization of naturally occurring mouse MAITs in health and disease.","['Cui, Yue', 'Franciszkiewicz, Katarzyna', 'Mburu, Yvonne K', 'Mondot, Stanislas', 'Le Bourhis, Lionel', 'Premel, Virginie', 'Martin, Emmanuel', 'Kachaner, Alexandra', 'Duban, Livine', 'Ingersoll, Molly A', 'Rabot, Sylvie', 'Jaubert, Jean', 'De Villartay, Jean-Pierre', 'Soudais, Claire', 'Lantz, Olivier']","['Cui Y', 'Franciszkiewicz K', 'Mburu YK', 'Mondot S', 'Le Bourhis L', 'Premel V', 'Martin E', 'Kachaner A', 'Duban L', 'Ingersoll MA', 'Rabot S', 'Jaubert J', 'De Villartay JP', 'Soudais C', 'Lantz O']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151012,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Mr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic/genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microbiota', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Urinary Tract Infections/immunology/microbiology']",2015/11/03 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['82424 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI82424 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 Nov 2;125(11):4171-85. doi: 10.1172/JCI82424.

Hence, to evaluate the impact of timing of allo-HSCT for patients with ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from patients with ATLL who received an allo-HSCT from a related donor. The median age was 52 years. Patients were grouped according to the interval from diagnosis to allo-HSCT: early transplant group, <100 days, n=72; late transplant group, 100 days, n=428.

The probability of OS in the early transplant group was significantly higher than that in the late transplant group (4-year OS, 49.3% vs 31.2%). Multivariate analysis revealed that late allo-HSCT was an unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.11; P=0.04).

These findings revealed that SSC of Balb/C mice are more sensitive to the toxic effects of busulfan then those of Swiss mice.","['Gutierrez, Karina', 'Glanzner, Werner G', 'Chemeris, Raiza O', 'Rigo, Melania L', 'Comim, Fabio V', 'Bordignon, Vilceu', 'Goncalves, Paulo B D']","['Gutierrez K', 'Glanzner WG', 'Chemeris RO', 'Rigo ML', 'Comim FV', 'Bordignon V', 'Goncalves PB']","['Laboratory of Biotechnology and Animal Reproduction-BioRep, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Biotechnology and Animal Reproduction-BioRep, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Biotechnology and Animal Reproduction-BioRep, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Biotechnology and Animal Reproduction-BioRep, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Biotechnology and Animal Reproduction-BioRep, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Brazil; Department of Clinical Medicine -Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Brazil.', 'Department of Animal Science, McGill University, 21,111 Lakeshore Road, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, H9X3V9 Canada.

METHODS: The lentivirus vector silencing the expression of CXCR4 was constructed for infection of SHI-1 cells silencing expression of CXCR4 in SHI-1 cells. The expression of CXCR4, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detected by real time PCR. The expression of CXCR4 on membrane of SHI-1 cells was detected by flow cytometry. The SHI-1 cell proliferation ability was detected by MTT. The co-culture system of the leukemia cells and bone marrow stromal cells was used to detect the adhesion and migration ability of leukemia cells. SHI-1 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice to investigate the growth ability in vivo. RESULTS: After SHI-1 cells were infected by lentivirus silencing expression of CXCR4, the expression of CXCR4 mRNA in SHI-1 CXCR-4i cells decreased by 76% as compared with expression of SHI-1/NC of negative control virus, the expression of CXCR4 on membrane of SHI-1/CXCR4i obviously downregulated; the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in SHI-1/CXCRi cells also declined by 63% and 62% respectively; the proliferation ability of SHI-1/CXCR4i in vitro did not obviously changed, but the adhesion and trans-matrigel invasion ability significantly decreased, the SHI-1/CXCR4i cells could not form neoplasm subcutaneously in mice, but the SHI-1 and SHI-1/NC cells could form neoplasm subcutaneously in mice, and there was no significant difference in volumn of neoplasm mass. CONCLUSION: The silencing expression of CXCR4 can decline the adhesion and migration ability of SHI-1 cells, and can completely suppress the formation of neoplasm subcutaneously, so the CXCR4 may serve as a target for treating leukemia.","['Fu, Lei', 'Li, Zhen-Jiang', 'Yang, Gui-Ling', 'Zheng, Ji-Fu', 'Shi, Qing-Zhi', 'Chen, San-Jun', 'Li, Jian']","['Fu L', 'Li ZJ', 'Yang GL', 'Zheng JF', 'Shi QZ', 'Chen SJ', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University, Jiangxi Province Key Labratory of Hematology, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233040, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University, Jiangxi Province Key Labratory of Hematology, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.

METHODS: The cytogenetic characteristics and PML/RARalpha fusion gene in 340 patients with suspectable APL were analyzed by using 3 detection methods. MICM (morphology, immunology, cytogenetic and molecular biology) was used as diagnostic standard of APL, and the diagnostic value of RT, D-FISH and RT-PCR was evaluated by comparing the detection results of RT, D-FISH and RT-PCR as well as their combination. RESULTS: For the diagnosis of APL, the sensitivity of RT, D-FISH and RT-PCR was 81.3% (78/96), 95.0% (91/96) and 96.9% (93/96) respectively. RT failed to detect 18 cases, the results of D-FISH showed 5 cases with false positive and 2 cases with false negative, the RT-PCR showed 4 cases with false positive, 3 cases with false negative. The sensitivity and specificity of combined detection of 3 methods were 99.97% and 100% respectively. CONCLUSION: The 3 detection methods alone all have certain defects for diagnosis of APL, but their combined detection is helpful to improve the definitive diagnostic rate and can decrease misdiagnosis rate and missed diagnostic rate.","['Peng, You-Fan', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhang, Qiong', 'Zhang, Zhao-Xia']","['Peng YF', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang ZX']","['Medical Diagnostic Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, Xinjiang, China.', 'Therapeutic Center of Blood Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical Diagnostic Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, Xinjiang, China.', 'Medical Diagnostic Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, Xinjiang, China.

METHODS: Using the NB4 cells as a model, morphologic observation and myeloid differentiation marker CD11b detection were used to monitor ATRA-induced APL differentiation, the expression of CSN complex in cell differentiation was detected by Western blot and reverse transcription real time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method. RT-qPCR was also used to detect the relative expression level of COP9 signalosome subunits in the APL patients and remission after treatment. RESULTS: ATRA could obviously enhance CD11b expression; the cell morphology showed obvious differentiation characteristics. During the differentiation, the expression of COP9 signalosome subunits was down-regulated by ATRA. Meanwhile, the CSN expression level in newly diagnosed APL patients was much higher than that in controls (non-leukemia) (P < 0.05). The level of CSN expression was obviously down-regulated when APL patients achieved complete remission. CONCLUSION: The high CSN expression level in APL patients can be down-regulated by ATRA.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing were used to amplify exon 4 of IDH1 gene, the gene sequencing was used to analyze the gene mutations, at same time, the detection of NPM1, FLT3-TKD, FLT3-ITD, C-KIT, CEPBA, TET2 and JAK2V617F and MLL mutations were carried out, the follow-up was used to determine its therapeutic efficacy and outcomes of patients. The clinical and laboratory data of these cases were collected, and their clinical characteristics and prognosis were then analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 192 AML patients, 13 cases were detected with IDH1 gene mutation, the mutation rate was 6.77% [95% CI (5.70%-13.38%)]. The sequencing chart of IDH1 gene showed double peaks, the mutations were heterozygous, out of them c.G395A (p.R132H) was found in 8 cases, c.C394T was found in 4 cases (p.R132C), c.C394A (p.R132S) was found in 1 cases, R132H and R132C are common, 13 cases showed missense mutation. The median age in mutation group was 52 years old, the median age in unnutration group was 40 years, there was significant difference between them (P = 0.010). Mutation rate of IDH1 gene in M1 and M2 was significantly higher than that in other FAB subtypes. There were no significant difference in sex, newly diagnosed peripheral white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, peripheral blood and bone marrow original cell proportion of primitive cells between them. Mutation of IDH1 gene had certain correlation with NPM1 gene mutation, but no correlation with FLT3-TKD, FLT3-ITD, C-KIT, TET2 and JAK2V617F and MLL natations was found. In addition, the IDH1 mutation easily occurred in patients with normal karyotype or in patients with middle prognostic risk karyotype, IDH1 mutation occurred in 11 cases with normal karyotype, the mutation rate was 10.28%, IDH1 mutation were observed in 2 cases with abnormal karyotype, the mutation rate was 3.50%, there was significant difference. In AML patients with middle prognostic risk karyotype. The complete remission (CR) and the 3 year survival (OS) rate of IDH1 mut patients were less than that in IDH1 wt, there was significant difference (P < 0.05).

METHOD: 20 samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood from each acute leukemia groups (newly diagnozed, relapsed and complete remission groups) and 20 samples as control from patients with no-hematologic malignancies were collected. The expression level of HMGB1 in peripheral blood plasma was determined by ELISA; HMGB1 and NF-kappaB level in mononuclear cells were examined by RT-PCR. Western blot was used to determine HMGB1 and NF-kappaB protein levels. HMGB1 and NF-kappaB in bone marrow smears were determined by immnohistochemistry method (IHC). RESULTS: The expression level of HMGB1 obviously increased in patients of newly diagnosed and relapsed groups, as compared with control group there was statistical significance (P < 0.05), but there was no obvious difference in expression level of HMGB1 between complete remission group and control group (P > 0.05). The expression level of HMGB1 and NF-kB in monnuclear cells of bone marrow in newly-diagnosed group and relapsed group was significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05), but the expression levels of HMGB1 and NF-kB in complete remisson group did not change (P > 0.05). The results of immnohistochemistry method indicated that the possitive expression of HMGB1 and NF-kB maily was found in bone marrow smears of newly diagnosed and relapsed groups. CONCLUSION: HMGB1 is overexpressed in acute leukemia, which may be involved in the occurrence and development of acute leukemia by activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, HMGB1 may be a important index for observing therapeutic effectiveness and predicting recurrence of acute leukemia.","['Zheng, Yong-Liang', 'Xin, Liu-Yan', 'Zhong, Si-Si', 'Chen, Yi-Jian']","['Zheng YL', 'Xin LY', 'Zhong SS', 'Chen YJ']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jinggangshan University, JiAn 343000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jinggangshan University, JiAn 343000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.

METHODS: A total of 10 cases of non-hematologic diseases were selected as control group, and the bone marrow cells of control group and HL-60, K562 cells were selected; the relative expression of miR-34b was detected in bone marrow cells, HL-60 and K562 cell lines by fluorescence quantitative PCR, and the MiR-34b methylation status was detected by methylation-specific PCR, the HL-60 and K562 cell lines were treated with decitabine, and the expression levels and methylation status of miR-34b in the 2 cell lines were detected by the same method. Has-miR-34b was transfected into K562 cells, which were divided into non-transfection group, negative control group and Has-miR-34b transfection group; if the transfection was successful, the cell proliferation should be recorded at different time points of culture, and the proliferation inhibition rate should be calculated. RESULTS: The relative expression level of miR-34b in the control group was (5.23 +/- 0.75), in HL-60 was (0.05 +/- 0.01) and in K562 was (0.04 +/- 0.01). The difference between 3 groups was statistically significant (F = 44.812, P < 0.01). The promoter regions of CpG island in HL-60 and K562 cell lines were methylated, while the bone marrow cells were not methylated in 10 cases of non hematologic diseases children.Through miR-34b expression levels of HL-60 and K562 cell lines significantly increased by decitabine treatment (P < 0.05), and the methylation of leukemia cell line promoter region CpG island was found before and after decitabine treatment, but after administration of decitabine the methylation significantly decreased, suggesting that decitabine has an inhibitory effect on methylation of promoter region CpG island. After being cultured for 48, 72, 96 and 120 hrs, the cell proliferation in Has-miR-34b transfection group reached to 24.8%, 46.7%, 33.6% and 4.7%, repectively, and significantly lower than that in non transfection group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CpG island methylation of miR-34b promoter region in leukemia cell lines can decrease the expression levels of miR-34b, which is also the reason why miR-34b can reduce the inhibition of cell proliferation, thus miR-34b might be a tumor suppressor gene involved in the regulation of leukemia.","['Guo, Jian-Xin', 'Zhou, Ya-Hong', 'Guan, Rui-Ting', 'Pan, Jing-Xin', 'Zhang, Xue-Ya', 'Zhong, Jin-Fa']","['Guo JX', 'Zhou YH', 'Guan RT', 'Pan JX', 'Zhang XY', 'Zhong JF']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.', 'Department of Hemodialysis, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratorial Examination, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, FuJian Province, China.

Antibodies immobilized within three separate microfluidic devices affinity-selected CLC subpopulations directly from peripheral blood without requiring pre-processing. The microfluidic devices targeted CD33, CD34, and CD117 cell surface antigens commonly expressed by AML leukemic cells so that each subpopulation's CLC numbers could be tracked to determine the onset of relapse. Staining against aberrant markers (e.g. CD7, CD56) identified low levels (11-2684 mL(-1)) of CLCs. The commonly used platforms for the detection of MRD for AML patients are multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC), typically from highly invasive bone marrow biopsies, or PCR from blood samples, which is limited to <50% of AML patients. In contrast, the microfluidic assay is a highly sensitive blood test that permits frequent sampling for >90% of all AML patients using the markers selected for this study (selection markers CD33, CD34, CD117 and aberrant markers such as CD7 and CD56). We present data from AML patients after stem cell transplant (SCT) therapy using our assay. We observed high agreement of the microfluidic assay with therapeutic treatment and overall outcome. We could detect MRD at an earlier stage compared to both MFC and PCR directly from peripheral blood, obviating the need for a painful bone marrow biopsy. Using the microfluidic assay, we detected MRD 28 days following one patient's SCT and the onset of relapse at day 57, while PCR from a bone marrow biopsy did not detect MRD until day 85 for the same patient. Earlier detection of MRD in AML post-SCT enabled by peripheral blood sampling using the microfluidic assay we report herein can influence curative clinical decisions for AML patients.","['Jackson, Joshua M', 'Taylor, James B', 'Witek, Malgorzata A', 'Hunsucker, Sally A', 'Waugh, Jennifer P', 'Fedoriw, Yuri', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Soper, Steven A', 'Armistead, Paul M']","['Jackson JM', 'Taylor JB', 'Witek MA', 'Hunsucker SA', 'Waugh JP', 'Fedoriw Y', 'Shea TC', 'Soper SA', 'Armistead PM']","['Department of Chemistry, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. ssoper@email.unc.edu and Center for Biomodular Multi-scale Systems for Precision Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. ssoper@email.unc.edu and Center for Biomodular Multi-scale Systems for Precision Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'Center for Biomodular Multi-scale Systems for Precision Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA and Department of Biomedical Engineering, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. paul_armistead@med.unc.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. paul_armistead@med.unc.edu and Department of Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. ssoper@email.unc.edu and Center for Biomodular Multi-scale Systems for Precision Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA. paul_armistead@med.unc.edu and Department of Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2015/11/03 06:00,2017/01/05 06:00,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5an01836f [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2016 Jan 21;141(2):640-51. doi: 10.1039/c5an01836f.,"['R21-CA173279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41-EB020594/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA173279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM086330/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB020594/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4701594,['NIHMS735264'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chemical gas affects different organs including the skin, lungs and the hematopoietic system. Any exposure to SM increases the risk of chromosomal breaking, hyperdiploidy and hypodiploidy. Studies have shown that the risk for acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemia increases in veterans exposed to SM. FLT3 mutations including ITD and TKD mutations had been observed in some cases of leukemia. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the frequency of FLT3-TKD835 mutations in the veterans exposed to SM agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 42 patients who were exposed to SM during the war in Khorasan Razavi province, Mashhad, Iran in 2012. As control group, 30 healthy males were selected from first-degree relatives of the patients. For assessment of TKD835 mutation, DNA was extracted and RFLP-PCR was performed. RESULTS: Analysis of RFLP-PCR data showed no FLT-3 TKD mutation in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: Although contact with SM can increase the risk of malignancy especially hematologic neoplasms, results of the study show that another mechanism of leukemogenesis, other than FLT3-TKD mutation, may be the reason for increased risk of leukemia in SM toxicity.","['Ayatollahi, Hossein', 'Rafiee, Mohammad', 'Keramati, Mohammad-Reza', 'Balali-Mood, Mahdi', 'Asgharzadeh, Ali', 'Sadeghian, Mohammad Hadi', 'Sheikhi, Maryam', 'Amini, Nafiseh', 'Zarmehri, Azam Moradi']","['Ayatollahi H', 'Rafiee M', 'Keramati MR', 'Balali-Mood M', 'Asgharzadeh A', 'Sadeghian MH', 'Sheikhi M', 'Amini N', 'Zarmehri AM']","['Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Medical Toxicology Research Center, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,2015/11/03 06:00,2015/11/03 06:01,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2015 Sep;18(9):862-6.,,PMC4620184,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-TKD835 mutation', 'Iran', 'Leukemia', 'Sulfur mustard']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These inhibitors might also promote cancer because NOTCH can act as a tumor suppressor. We previously reported that the PIAS-like coactivator ZMIZ1 is frequently co-expressed with activated NOTCH1 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we show that similar to Notch1, Zmiz1 was important for T cell development and controlled the expression of certain Notch target genes, such as Myc. However, unlike Notch, Zmiz1 had no major role in intestinal homeostasis or myeloid suppression. Deletion of Zmiz1 impaired the initiation and maintenance of Notch-induced T-ALL. Zmiz1 directly interacted with Notch1 via a tetratricopeptide repeat domain at a special class of Notch-regulatory sites. In contrast to the Notch cofactor Maml, which is nonselective, Zmiz1 was selective.

The proposed tests are improvements over some existing tests based on asymptotic confidence bands of certain functions of the estimated cumulative hazard functions. The new methods are based on the comparison of unrestricted estimates of the said functions and their restricted versions under the hypothesis. They combine the rigour of analytical tests with the descriptive value of plots. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the proposed asymptotic procedures have reasonable small sample properties. The power is much higher than existing graphical tests and comparable with existing analytical tests.

However, the contribution of ZFP521 to lymphomagenesis has not been confirmed. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of ZFP521 in B-cell lymphomagenesis. To this end, we used a retroviral insertion method to show that ZFP521 was a target of mutagenesis in pre-B-lymphoblastic lymphoma cells. The pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling molecules BLNK, BTK and BANK1 were positively regulated by the ZFP521 gene, leading to enhancement of the pre-BCR signaling pathway. In addition, c-myc and c-jun were upregulated following activation of ZFP521. Stimulation of pre-BCR signaling using anti-Vpreb antibodies caused aberrant upregulation of c-myc and c-jun and of Ccnd3, which encodes cyclin D3, thereby inducing the growth of pre-B cells. Stimulation with Vpreb affected the growth of pre-B cells, and addition of interleukin (IL)-7 receptor exerted competitive effects on pre-B-cell growth. Knockdown of BTK and BANK1, targets of ZFP521, suppressed the effects of Vpreb stimulation on cell growth. Furthermore, in human lymphoblastic lymphoma, analogous to pre-B-cell lymphoma in mice, the expression of ZNF521, the homolog of ZFP521 in humans, was upregulated. In conclusion, our data showed that the ZFP521 gene comprehensively induced pre-B-cell lymphomagenesis by modulating the pre-B-cell receptor signaling pathway.","['Hiratsuka, T', 'Takei, Y', 'Ohmori, R', 'Imai, Y', 'Ozeki, M', 'Tamaki, K', 'Haga, H', 'Nakamura, T', 'Tsuruyama, T']","['Hiratsuka T', 'Takei Y', 'Ohmori R', 'Imai Y', 'Ozeki M', 'Tamaki K', 'Haga H', 'Nakamura T', 'Tsuruyama T']","['Department of Pathology and Biology of Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Center for Anatomical, Pathological, and Forensic Medical Research, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Carcinogenesis, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Center for Anatomical, Pathological, and Forensic Medical Research, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151102,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (BANK1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Evi3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B Cell Receptors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cyclin D3/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Pre-B Cell Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/11/03 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2015385 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.385 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Jun 23;35(25):3227-38. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.385.

RESULTS: The mRNA and protein level of endogenous ESRP1 was lower in U251 cells than in normal gliocytes. The level of MCL1 isoform 1 was higher, while isoform 2 and 3 were lower in U251 cells than in normal gliocytes. Furthermore, MCL1 isoform 1 was reduced and isoform 3 was up-regulated in U251 cells after ESRP1 over-expression. Isoform 2 was unchanged obviously. Finally, MCL1 with the deletion of 801G and 802A sites could not be correctly spliced by ESRP1 and no significant difference was seen in the expressions of isoform 1 and 3 in mutant MCL1.

Recent reports of germline ETV6 variations associated with substantial familial clustering of haematological malignancies indicated that this gene is a potentially important genetic determinant for ALL susceptibility. Our aims in this study were to comprehensively identify ALL predisposition variants in ETV6 and to determine the extent to which they contributed to the overall risk of childhood ALL. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing of an index family with several cases of ALL was done to identify causal variants for ALL predisposition. Targeted sequencing of ETV6 was done in children from the Children's Oncology Group and St Jude Children's Research Hospital front-line ALL trials. Patients were included in this study on the basis of their enrolment in these clinical trials and the availability of germline DNA. ETV6 variant genotypes were compared with non-ALL controls to define ALL-related germline risk variants. ETV6 variant function was characterised bioinformatically and correlated with clinical and demographic features in children with ALL. FINDINGS: We identified a novel non-sense ETV6 variant (p.Arg359X) with a high penetrance in an index family. Subsequent targeted sequencing of ETV6 in 4405 childhood ALL cases identified 31 exonic variants (four non-sense, 21 missense, one splice site, and five frameshift variants) that were potentially related to ALL risk in 35 cases (1%). 15 (48%) of 31 ALL-related ETV6 variants clustered in the erythroblast transformation specific domain and were predicted to be highly deleterious. Children with ALL-related ETV6 variants were significantly older at leukaemia diagnosis than those without (10.2 years [IQR 5.3-13.8] vs 4.7 years [3.0-8.7]; p=0.017). The hyperdiploid leukaemia karyotype was highly over-represented in ALL cases harbouring germline ETV6 risk variants compared with the wild-type group (nine [64%] of 14 cases vs 538 [27%] of 2007 cases; p=0.0050). INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicated germline ETV6 variations as the basis of a novel genetic syndrome associated with predisposition to childhood ALL. The development of recommendations for clinical interventions and surveillance for individuals harbouring ALL-related ETV6 variants are needed.

Previous reports suggested a potential role of myeloid cells in mediating these defects. However, the composition and function of CLL-associated myeloid cells have not been thoroughly investigated in vivo. Using the Emu-TCL1 mouse model, we observed severe skewing of myeloid cell populations with CLL development. Monocytes and M2-like macrophages infiltrated the peritoneal cavity of leukemic mice. Monocytes also accumulated in the spleen in a CCR2-dependent manner, and were severely skewed toward Ly6C(low) patrolling or nonclassical phenotype. In addition, the percentage of MHC-II(hi) dendritic cells and macrophages significantly dropped in the spleen. Gene expression profiling of CLL-associated monocytes revealed aberrantly high PD-L1 expression and secretion of multiple inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines like interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and CXCL9. In vivo myeloid cell depletion using liposomal Clodronate resulted in a significant control of CLL development accompanied by a pronounced repair of innate immune cell phenotypes and a partial resolution of systemic inflammation. In addition, CLL-associated skewing of T cells toward antigen-experienced phenotypes was repaired. The presented data suggest that targeting nonmalignant myeloid cells might serve as a novel immunotherapeutical strategy for CLL.","['Hanna, B S', 'McClanahan, F', 'Yazdanparast, H', 'Zaborsky, N', 'Kalter, V', 'Rossner, P M', 'Benner, A', 'Durr, C', 'Egle, A', 'Gribben, J G', 'Lichter, P', 'Seiffert, M']","['Hanna BS', 'McClanahan F', 'Yazdanparast H', 'Zaborsky N', 'Kalter V', 'Rossner PM', 'Benner A', 'Durr C', 'Egle A', 'Gribben JG', 'Lichter P', 'Seiffert M']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department for Hematology, Paracelsus Private Medical University Hospital, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department for Hematology, Paracelsus Private Medical University Hospital, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151102,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Ccr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL9)', '0 (Cxcl9 protein, mouse)', '0 (IL10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ly-6C antigen, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CCR2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Chemokine CXCL9/genetics/immunology', 'Clodronic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, CCR2/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/immunology']",2015/11/03 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015305 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.305 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):570-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.305.

Hypomethylating drugs such as azacitidine are active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as monotherapy. Azacitidine monotherapy is not curative. The AML-AZA trial tested the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as azacitidine can improve chemotherapy outcome in AML. This randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy of azacitidine applied before each cycle of intensive chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in older patients with untreated AML. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary end point. In total, 214 patients with a median age of 70 years were randomized to azacitidine/chemotherapy (arm-A) or chemotherapy (arm-B). More arm-A patients (39/105; 37%) than arm-B (25/109; 23%) showed adverse cytogenetics (P=0.057). Adverse events were more frequent in arm-A (15.44) versus 13.52 in arm-B, (P=0.26), but early death rates did not differ significantly (30-day mortality: 6% versus 5%, P=0.76). Median EFS was 6 months in both arms (P=0.96). Median overall survival was 15 months for patients in arm-A compared with 21 months in arm-B (P=0.35). Azacitidine added to standard chemotherapy increases toxicity in older patients with AML, but provides no additional benefit for unselected patients.","['Muller-Tidow, C', 'Tschanter, P', 'Rollig, C', 'Thiede, C', 'Koschmieder, A', 'Stelljes, M', 'Koschmieder, S', 'Dugas, M', 'Gerss, J', 'Butterfass-Bahloul, T', 'Wagner, R', 'Eveslage, M', 'Thiem, U', 'Krause, S W', 'Kaiser, U', 'Kunzmann, V', 'Steffen, B', 'Noppeney, R', 'Herr, W', 'Baldus, C D', 'Schmitz, N', 'Gotze, K', 'Reichle, A', 'Kaufmann, M', 'Neubauer, A', 'Schafer-Eckart, K', 'Hanel, M', 'Peceny, R', 'Frickhofen, N', 'Kiehl, M', 'Giagounidis, A', 'Gorner, M', 'Repp, R', 'Link, H', 'Kiani, A', 'Naumann, R', 'Brummendorf, T H', 'Serve, H', 'Ehninger, G', 'Berdel, W E', 'Krug, U']","['Muller-Tidow C', 'Tschanter P', 'Rollig C', 'Thiede C', 'Koschmieder A', 'Stelljes M', 'Koschmieder S', 'Dugas M', 'Gerss J', 'Butterfass-Bahloul T', 'Wagner R', 'Eveslage M', 'Thiem U', 'Krause SW', 'Kaiser U', 'Kunzmann V', 'Steffen B', 'Noppeney R', 'Herr W', 'Baldus CD', 'Schmitz N', 'Gotze K', 'Reichle A', 'Kaufmann M', 'Neubauer A', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Hanel M', 'Peceny R', 'Frickhofen N', 'Kiehl M', 'Giagounidis A', 'Gorner M', 'Repp R', 'Link H', 'Kiani A', 'Naumann R', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Serve H', 'Ehninger G', 'Berdel WE', 'Krug U']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A -

Present study describes the isolation and characterization of another turmeric-derived compound, beta-sesquiphellandrene (SQP) that exhibits anticancer potential comparable to that of curcumin. We isolated several compounds from turmeric, including SQP, alpha-curcumene, ar-turmerone, alpha-turmerone, beta-turmerone, and gamma-turmerone, only SQP was found to have antiproliferative effects comparable to those of curcumin in human leukemia, multiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer cells. While lack of the NF-kappaB-p65 protein had no effect on the activity of SQP, lung cancer cells that expressed p53 were more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of SQP than were cells that lacked p53 expression. SQP was also found to be highly effective in suppressing cancer cell colony formation and inducing apoptosis, as shown by assays of intracellular esterase activity, plasma membrane integrity, and cell-cycle phase. SQP was found to induce cytochrome c release and activate caspases that lead to poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. SQP exposure was associated with downregulation of cell survival proteins such cFLIP, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, c-IAP1, and survivin. Furthermore, SQP was found to be synergistic with the chemotherapeutic agents velcade, thalidomide and capecitabine. Overall, our results indicate that SQP has anticancer potential comparable to that of curcumin.","['Tyagi, Amit Kumar', 'Prasad, Sahdeo', 'Yuan, Wei', 'Li, Shiyou', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Tyagi AK', 'Prasad S', 'Yuan W', 'Li S', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics Unit 1950, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics Unit 1950, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. sprasad@mdanderson.org.', 'National Center for Pharmaceutical Crops, Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture, Stephen F.

We examined data on 1,117 autopsy cases and found that the organ distribution of metastasis of cancers of the lung, pancreas, stomach, colon, rectum, uterine cervix, liver, bile duct, and esophagus involved the lung, liver, adrenal gland, bone/bone marrow, lymph node, and pleura/peritoneum. Cancers of the kidney, thyroid, ovary, choriocarcinoma, and breast, however, manifested different metastatic patterns. The distribution of leukemia and lymphoma metastases was quite different from that of epithelial cancers. On the basis of experimental studies, we believe that the anatomical-mechanical hypothesis should be replaced by the microinjury hypothesis, which suggests that tissue microinjury induced by temporal tumor cell embolization is crucial for successful metastasis. This hypothesis may actually reflect the so-called inflammatory oncotaxis concept. To clarify the mechanisms underlying metastasis, we developed an experimental model system of a rat hepatoma AH7974 that embraced substrate adhesiveness. This model did not prove a relationship between substrate-adhesion potential and metastatic lung-colonizing potential of tumor cells, but metastatic potential was correlated with the expression of the laminin carbohydrate that was recognized by Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia isolectin G4. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between carbohydrate expression profiles and metastasis and prognosis. We indeed found an intimate relationship between the carbohydrate expression of cancer cells and the progression of malignant tumors, organ preference of metastasis, metastatic potential of tumor cells, and prognosis of patients.","['Kawaguchi, Takanori']",['Kawaguchi T'],"['Division of Human Life Science, Fukushima Medical University School of Nursing, Fukushima 960- 1295, Japan. t-kawa@fmu.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology']",2015/11/03 06:00,2016/12/30 06:00,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['CHDDT-EPUB-71502 [pii]', '10.2174/1871529x15666151102102551 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2016;15(3):164-86. doi: 10.2174/1871529x15666151102102551.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoption of LNT by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) became the standard for radiation regulation worldwide. The ICRP recommends a dose limit of 1 mSv/year for the public, which is too low and which terrorizes innocent people. Indeed, LNT arose mainly from the lifespan survivor study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors. The LSS, which asserts linear dose-response and no threshold, is challenged mainly on three points. 1) Radiation doses were underestimated by half because of disregard for major residual radiation, resulting in cancer risk overestimation. 2) The dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) of 2 is used, but the actual DDREF is estimated as 16, resulting in cancer risk overestimation by several times. 3) Adaptive response (hormesis) is observed in leukemia and solid cancer cases, consistently contradicting the linearity of LNT. Drastic reduction of cancer risk moves the dose-response curve close to the control line, allowing the setting of a threshold. Living organisms have been evolving for 3.8 billion years under radiation exposure, naturally acquiring various defense mechanisms such as DNA repair mechanisms, apoptosis, and immune response. The failure of LNT lies in the neglect of carcinogenesis and these biological mechanisms. Obstinate application of LNT continues to cause tremendous human, social, and economic losses. The 60-year-old LNT must be rejected to establish a new scientific knowledge-based system.","['Sutou, Shizuyo']",['Sutou S'],"['Laboratory of Functional Genomics, School of Pharmacy, Shujitsu University.']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,,IM,"['Animals', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Fukushima Nuclear Accident', 'Humans', '*Linear Models', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Radiation Genetics', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiometry', '*Risk Assessment']",2015/11/03 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2015/11/03 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/yakushi.15-00188 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2015;135(11):1197-211. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.15-00188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Common signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and WNT/beta-catenin, regulate multiple MSC properties, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cell interaction. Here, with polymerase chain reaction arrays, we investigated the expression of 84 genes belonging to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in BM-MSCs isolated from patients with MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, using as a control BM-MSCs isolated from patients with untreated early-stage lymphomas without BM involvement. Statistically significant downregulation of GSK3beta, SOS1, RASA1, and MTCP1 gene expression was observed in BM-MSCs isolated from patients with de novo MDS, as compared with controls. Moreover, expression of the GSK3beta protein was reduced in MDS-derived MSCs, and was associated with concomitant reduction of phosphorylation at Ser-9. The role of GSK3beta in the downstream WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway was assessed. We investigated beta-catenin protein levels and expression of 84 genes belonging to the WNT target gene pathway using PCR arrays in MDS BM-MSCs, as compared with control BM-MSCs. GSK3beta impairment translated into decreased beta-catenin protein levels and downregulation of several WNT/beta-catenin target genes (SOX9, EGR1, WISP1). These findings suggest that deregulation of genes involved in the PI3K/AKT and WNT signaling pathways may contribute to the phenotypical abnormalities of MDS BM-MSCs.","['Falconi, Giulia', 'Fabiani, Emiliano', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Raffaelli, Chiara Spertilli', 'Bellesi, Silvia', 'Hohaus, Stefan', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', ""D'Alo, Francesco"", 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Falconi G', 'Fabiani E', 'Fianchi L', 'Criscuolo M', 'Raffaelli CS', 'Bellesi S', 'Hohaus S', 'Voso MT', ""D'Alo F"", 'Leone G']","['Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Universita Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.

The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the new analogues and their precursors was evaluated using a series of human and murine tumor cells. BAT conjugates containing retro-tuftsin with branched side aminoacid chain, in particular with leucine or isoleucine, were about 10-fold more cytotoxic toward two human tumor cell lines (lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and myeloblastic leukemia (HL-60)). These compounds showed about 10-fold increased cytotoxicity against the two types of tumor cells compared to parent BAT. We have not observed important differences in the mechanism of action between BAT and its cytotoxic tuftsin/retro-tuftsin conjugates. We propose that high biological activity of the most active BAT conjugates is a result of their greatly increased intracellular accumulation.","['Januchta, Wioleta', 'Serocki, Marcin', 'Dzierzbicka, Krystyna', 'Cholewinski, Grzegorz', 'Skladanowski, Andrzej']","['Januchta W', 'Serocki M', 'Dzierzbicka K', 'Cholewinski G', 'Skladanowski A']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, 11/12 G.

Clinical course, treatment, and outcome of patients with hematological malignancies who suffered from RSV infections at the age of <24 months during anti-tumor therapy from April 2006 to March 2009 were investigated by sending a questionnaire to all member institutions of the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG). Twelve patients with acute leukemia were identified as having experienced RSV disease. The primary diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4). RSV infection occurred pre- or during induction therapy (n = 8) and during consolidation therapy (n = 4). Eight patients developed LRTI, four of whom had severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome; these four patients died despite receiving intensive care. In our survey, the prognosis of RSV disease in pediatric hematological malignancies was poor, and progression of LRTI in particular was associated with high mortality.

Cancer incidence was investigated in time to event analyses (1990-2008) using Cox proportional hazards models and incidence density analyses (1985-2008) using Poisson regression. Adjustments were made for socio-economic factors, ionising background radiation and electromagnetic fields. In time to event analysis based on 532 cases the adjusted hazard ratio for leukaemia comparing children living <100 m from a highway with unexposed children (>/=500 m) was 1.43 (95 % CI 0.79, 2.61). Results were similar in incidence density analysis including 1367 leukaemia cases (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.57; 95 % CI 1.09, 2.25).

HCL/HCLv genomic DNA from 46 patients was studied by PCR to determine the ratio of telomere to single copy gene number (T/S). T/S was unrelated to diagnosis of HCL or HCLv (p=0.27), but shorter T/S was associated with unmutated immunoglobulin rearrangements (p=0.033) and age above the median at diagnosis (p=0.017). Low T/S was associated with shorter overall survival from diagnosis (OS), particularly T/S <0.655 (p=0.0064, adjusted p=0.019). Shorter OS was also associated with presence of unmutated (p<0.0001) or IGHV4-34+ (p<0.0001) rearrangements, or increasing age (p=0.0002). Multivariable analysis with Cox modeling showed that short T/S along with either unmutated or IGHV4-34+ rearrangements remained associated with reduced OS (p=0.0071, p=0.0024, respectively) after age adjustment. While T/S is relatively long in HCL and the disease usually indolent with excellent survival, shortened telomeres in HCL/HCLv are associated with decreased survival. Shortened T/S could represent a risk factor needing further investigation/intervention to determine if non-chemotherapy treatment options, in addition to or instead of chemotherapy, might be particularly useful.","['Arons, Evgeny', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Edelman, Daniel C', 'Gomez, Allison', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Petersen, David', 'Wang, Yonghong', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Kreitman, Robert J']","['Arons E', 'Zhou H', 'Edelman DC', 'Gomez A', 'Steinberg SM', 'Petersen D', 'Wang Y', 'Meltzer PS', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, United States.', 'Cancer Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, United States.', 'Cancer Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, United States.', 'Biostatistics and Data Management Section, Office of the Clinical Director, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, 37/5124b, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, United States.', 'Cancer Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, United States.', 'Cancer Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, United States.', 'Cancer Genetics Branch, NCI, NIH, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, United States.

Here, using immunocytochemistry of bone marrow smears from diagnosis, we studied global histone H4 acetylation, whose loss was previously linked to treatment failure in adults with ALL, in pediatric patients. We demonstrate that preserved global histone H4 acetylation is significantly associated with favorable outcome (RFS, EFS, OS) in children with B cell progenitor (BCP) ALL, recapitulating the findings from adult populations. Further, for the first time we demonstrate differential histone H4 acetylation in molecular subclasses of BCP-ALL including cases with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene or PAX5 deletion or deletions in genes linked to B cell development.

Kaplan-Meier survival function, propensity scores and stratified Cox proportional hazards regression were used for data analyses. After controlling for other prognostic factors, females showed a significant survival advantage over their male counterparts, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.00-1.18). Compared to females, male patients had substantially increased risk of mortality in the following subgroups of: ages 20-24 years at diagnosis (aHR1.30), Caucasian (1.14), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (1.35), acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) (1.39), AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) (2.57), AML with minimum differentiation (1.47); and had substantially decreased aHR in AML t(9;11)(p22;q23) (0.57) and AML with maturation (0.82). Overall, females demonstrated increased survival over males and this disparity was considerably large in patients ages 20-24 years at diagnosis, Caucasians, and in AML subtypes of AML inv(16), APL and AEL.

Epidemiological analyses of the survivors of the Japanese atomic bombings show that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) can cause leukaemia. Although a clear association between radiation exposure and leukaemia development is acknowledged, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. A hemizygous deletion on mouse chromosome 2 (del2) is a common feature in several mouse strains susceptible to radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML). The deletion is an early event detectable 24h after exposure in bone marrow cells. Ultimately, 15-25% of exposed animals develop AML with 80-90% of cases carrying del2. Molecular mapping of leukaemic cell genomes identified a minimal deleted region (MDR) on chromosome 2 (chr2) in which a tumour suppressor gene, Sfpi1 is located, encoding the transcription factor PU.1, essential in haematopoiesis. The remaining copy of Sfpi1 has a point mutation in the coding sequence for the DNA-binding domain of the protein in 70% of rAML, which alters a single CpG sequence in the codon for arginine residue R235. In order to identify chr2 deletions and Sfpi.1/PU.1 loss, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a unique panel of 79rAMLs. Using a custom made CGH array specifically designed for mouse chr2, we analysed at unprecedentedly high resolution (1.4M array- 148bp resolution) the size of the MDR in low LET and high-LET induced rAMLs (32 X-ray- and 47 neutron-induced). Sequencing of Sfpi1/PU.1DNA binding domain identified the presence of R235 point mutations, showing no influence of radiation quality on R235 type or frequency. We identified for the first time rAML cases with complex del2 in a subset of neutron-induced AMLs. This study allowed us to re-define the MDR to a much smaller 5.5Mb region (still including Sfpi1/PU.1), identical regardless of radiation quality.","['Brown, Natalie', 'Finnon, Rosemary', 'Manning, Grainne', 'Bouffler, Simon', 'Badie, Christophe']","['Brown N', 'Finnon R', 'Manning G', 'Bouffler S', 'Badie C']","['Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORQ, UK.', 'Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 ORQ, UK.

METHODS: Patient demographics were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Information on age, gender, year of diagnosis, first treatment, and date of death were recorded. Overall survival (OS) was adjusted for death rates in the normal population. RESULTS: Incidence in males decreased slightly from 1.2 per 100.000 person years (PY) in 1989-2000 to 0.9 in 2001-2012. For females, incidence remained stable with 0.7 per 100.000 PY in both periods. Incidence was age dependent and highest in males in the last decades of life. Treatment before 2000 mainly consisted of chemotherapy, while after 2007 TKI use was 88%. Five-year relative survival was only 36% before the introduction of TKIs but significantly increased to 79% after the introduction of TKI. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives insight into CML incidence, treatment, and survival in routine care in the Netherlands.

Here, we analyzed expression of WT1 in 226 peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) before and after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Transcripts were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and WT1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) were monitored by tetramer staining and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. Reduction of WT1 levels correlated with a longer survival (p < 0.01). Increment of WT1 transcripts eventually resulted in relapse and subsequent death of the patients. In patients with longer survival and continuous complete remission (cCR) after SCT, higher and enduring frequencies of WT1-specific CTL than in patients developing a relapse were detected.

Signaling through the Valpha14-Jalpha18 TCR instructs commitment to the NKT cell lineage, but the precise signaling mechanisms that instruct their lineage choice are unclear. In this article, we report that the cytoskeletal remodeling protein, p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2), was essential for NKT cell development. Loss of Pak2 in T cells reduced stage III NKT cells in the thymus and periphery. Among different NKT cell subsets, Pak2 was necessary for the generation and function of NKT1 and NKT2 cells, but not NKT17 cells. Mechanistically, expression of Egr2 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), two key transcription factors for acquiring the NKT cell fate, were markedly diminished in the absence of Pak2. Diminished expression of Egr2 and PLZF were not caused by aberrant TCR signaling, as determined using a Nur77-GFP reporter, but were likely due to impaired induction and maintenance of signaling lymphocyte activation molecule 6 expression, a TCR costimulatory receptor required for NKT cell development. These data suggest that Pak2 controls thymic NKT cell development by providing a signal that links Egr2 to induce PLZF, in part by regulating signaling lymphocyte activation molecule 6 expression.","[""O'Hagan, Kyle L"", 'Zhao, Jie', 'Pryshchep, Olga', 'Wang, Chyung-Ru', 'Phee, Hyewon']","[""O'Hagan KL"", 'Zhao J', 'Pryshchep O', 'Wang CR', 'Phee H']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611.', 'Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611.', 'Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611.', 'Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611.', 'Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611 hyewonp@amgen.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151030,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nr4a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '169535-43-7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/*biosynthesis', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'p21-Activated Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/11/01 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/11/01 06:00'],"['2015/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1501367 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1501367 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Dec 1;195(11):5272-84. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501367.

Estimating the prevalence of BLV within dairy herds is a fundamental step towards pursuing efficient control programs. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the prevalence of BLV infection at the herd level using a bulk-tank milk (BTM) antibody ELISA in the Maritime region of Canada (3 provinces); and (2) to develop appropriate statistical models for predicting within-herd prevalence of BLV infection using BTM antibody ELISA titers. During 2013, three monthly BTM samples were collected from all dairy farms in the Maritime region of Canada (n=623) and tested for BLV milk antibodies using a commercial indirect ELISA. Based on the mean of the 3 BTM titers, 15 strata of herds (5 per province) were defined. From each stratum, 6 herds were randomly selected for a total of 90 farms. Within every selected herd, an additional BTM sample was taken (round 4), approximately 2 months after the third round. On the same day of BTM sampling, all cows that contributed milk to the fourth BTM sample were individually tested for BLV milk antibodies (n=6111) to estimate the true within-herd prevalence for the 90 herds. The association between true within-herd prevalence of BLV and means of various combinations of the BTM titers was assessed using linear regression models, adjusting for the stratified random sampling design. Herd level prevalence of BLV in the region was 90.8%. In the individual testing, 30.4% of cows were positive. True within-herd prevalences ranged from 0 to 94%. All linear regression models were able to predict the true within-herd prevalence of BLV reasonably well (R(2)>0.69). Predictions from the models were particularly accurate for low-to-medium spectrums of the BTM titers. In general, as a greater number of the four repeated BTM titers were incorporated in the models, narrower confidence intervals around the prediction lines were achieved. The model including all 4 BTM tests as the predictor had the best fit, although the models using 2 and 3 BTM tests provided similar results to 4 repeated tests. Therefore, testing two or three BTM samples with approximately two-month intervals would provide relatively precise estimates for the potential number of infected cows in a herd. The developed models in this study could be applied to control and eradication programs for BLV as cost-effective tools.","['Nekouei, Omid', 'Stryhn, Henrik', 'VanLeeuwen, John', 'Kelton, David', 'Hanna, Paul', 'Keefe, Greg']","['Nekouei O', 'Stryhn H', 'VanLeeuwen J', 'Kelton D', 'Hanna P', 'Keefe G']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.

Here, we adopted molecular dynamics simulation with molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann/surface area method (MM-PB/SA) to study the inhibition mechanism of three Mcl-1 inhibitors, compounds 1, 2 and 3. Analysis of energy components shows that the better binding free energy of compound 3 than compounds 1 and 2 is attributable to the van der Waals energy (DeltaEvdw ) and non-polar solvation energy (DeltaGnp ) upon binding. In addition to the excellent agreement with previous experimentally determined affinities, our simulation results further show a bend of helix 4 on Mcl-1 upon compound 3 binding, which is driven by hydrophobic interaction with residue Val(253) , leading to a narrowed BH3-binding groove to impede Puma(BH) (3) binding. The computational result is consistent with our competitive isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays, which shows that the competitive ability of compound 3 toward Mcl-1/Puma(BH) (3) complex is improved beyond its direct binding affinity toward Mcl-1 itself, and compound 3 exhibits much more efficiency to compete with Puma(BH) (3) than compound 2.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of open surgery in this complex aortic pathology. METHODS: Between June 2002 and 2015, a total of 17 patients (median age 57, range 32-76 years) necessitating complete arch replacement presented complex chronic dissection of the thoraco-abdominal aorta with the visceral arteries originating from different lumens. Fourteen patients (82%) had had previous cardiac surgery, which was performed on the proximal aorta in all but one because of acute type A dissection. Nine patients without considerable dilatation of the descending aorta received aortic arch replacement with distal resection of the dissection membrane, and 8 patients with progressive dilatation of the thoracic aorta underwent aortic arch and descending aorta replacement via clamshell approach. RESULTS: No early (defined as 30-day, 90-day and in-hospital period) deaths, strokes or spinal cord injuries occurred. Only 1 patient (6%) presented temporary neurological dysfunctions (delirium, agitation), which resolved completely before discharge, and an injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was documented in 2 patients (12%). Temporary dialysis was necessary in 1 case. The follow-up was complete for all patients. All but one patient, who died due to leukaemia 23 months after surgery, were alive at the last follow-up (median duration 33 months, range 2-118 months). No patient needed a reoperation or an intervention on the thoracic and/or abdominal aorta. Moreover, no noticeable progression of the chronic dissection in the downstream aorta was documented in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The results after conventional aortic arch repair with distal resection of the dissection membrane and, if necessary, with replacement of the progressively dilated chronic dissected thoracic aorta can offer excellent results in experienced hands and, therefore, this technique may be considered as a preferable option for surgical treatment of chronic aortic dissection with involvement of the aortic arch and the visceral arteries originating from different lumens.","['Urbanski, Paul P', 'Bougioukakis, Petros', 'Deja, Marek A', 'Diegeler, Anno', 'Irimie, Vadim', 'Lenos, Aristidis', 'Zembala, Michal O']","['Urbanski PP', 'Bougioukakis P', 'Deja MA', 'Diegeler A', 'Irimie V', 'Lenos A', 'Zembala MO']","['Cardiovascular Clinic Bad Neustadt, Bad Neustadt, Germany p.urbanski@kardiochirurg.de.', 'Cardiovascular Clinic Bad Neustadt, Bad Neustadt, Germany.', 'Cardiovascular Clinic, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Cardiovascular Clinic Bad Neustadt, Bad Neustadt, Germany.', 'Cardiovascular Clinic Bad Neustadt, Bad Neustadt, Germany.', 'Cardiovascular Clinic Bad Neustadt, Bad Neustadt, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Silesian Center for Heart Diseases, Zabrze, Poland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151030,Germany,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,8804069,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneurysm, Dissecting/mortality/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Aorta, Thoracic/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Aortic Aneurysm/mortality/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",2015/11/01 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2015/11/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ezv386 [pii]', '10.1093/ejcts/ezv386 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2016 May;49(5):1382-90. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezv386.

METHODS: A semi-Markov model (3-month cycle length) used survival curves to govern progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Efficacy and safety data and health-state utility values were estimated from the COMPLEMENT-1 trial. Post-progression treatment patterns were based on clinical guidelines, Canadian treatment practices and published literature. Total and incremental expected lifetime costs (in Canadian dollars [$Can], year 2013 values), life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed. Uncertainty was assessed via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The discounted lifetime health and economic outcomes estimated by the model showed that, compared with chlorambucil, first-line treatment with OChl led to an increase in QALYs (0.41) and total costs ($Can27,866) and to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $Can68,647 per QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to the modelling time horizon and to the extrapolation of OS treatment effects beyond the trial duration. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can100,000 per QALY gained was 59 %. CONCLUSIONS: Base-case results indicated that improved overall response and PFS for OChl compared with chlorambucil translated to improved quality-adjusted life expectancy. Sensitivity analysis suggested that OChl is likely to be cost effective subject to uncertainty associated with the presence of any long-term OS benefit and the model time horizon.","['Herring, William', 'Pearson, Isobel', 'Purser, Molly', 'Nakhaipour, Hamid Reza', 'Haiderali, Amin', 'Wolowacz, Sorrel', 'Jayasundara, Kavisha']","['Herring W', 'Pearson I', 'Purser M', 'Nakhaipour HR', 'Haiderali A', 'Wolowacz S', 'Jayasundara K']","['RTI Health Solutions, 200 Park Offices Drive, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC, 27709, USA. wherring@rti.org.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Didsbury, Manchester, UK.', 'RTI Health Solutions, 200 Park Offices Drive, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC, 27709, USA.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Didsbury, Manchester, UK.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Canada', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/adverse effects/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Models, Economic', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",2015/11/01 06:00,2017/01/12 06:00,['2015/11/01 06:00'],"['2015/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40273-015-0332-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s40273-015-0332-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2016 Jan;34(1):77-90. doi: 10.1007/s40273-015-0332-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary objectives were to determine risk factors for IFD and resource utilization associated with IFD. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of adult patients with ALL from commencement of induction until completion of consolidation chemotherapy was undertaken from January 2008 to June 2013 in four hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. IFD was classified according to the revised European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. Cost analysis was performed from an Australian public hospital perspective. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included in the audit; 83 (85%) received PAP. Most patients (49/83, 59%) switched between two different antifungal agents, predominantly between liposomal amphotericin B and an azole. Five proven/probable and six possible IFD cases were identified. Proven/probable IFD was most common in patients receiving the BFM95 chemotherapy protocol. The incidence of proven/probable IFD was significantly lower in patients receiving PAP compared with those who did not (2/78, 2.6% versus 3/14, 21.4%; P = 0.024). For every five patients receiving PAP, one proven/probable IFD case would be prevented. Proven/probable IFD was associated with an additional median cost of 121,520 Australian dollars (95% CI: 90,781-180,141 Australian dollars; P < 0.001) compared with patients without IFD. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicentre study evaluating PAP use in patients with ALL. With the caveats of interpretation of retrospective, non-randomized data, PAP was associated with a reduced IFD risk.","['Doan, Tan N', 'Kirkpatrick, Carl M J', 'Walker, Patricia', 'Slavin, Monica A', 'Ananda-Rajah, Michelle R', 'Morrissey, C Orla', 'Urbancic, Karen F', 'Grigg, Andrew', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Szer, Jeffrey', 'Seymour, John F', 'Kong, David C M']","['Doan TN', 'Kirkpatrick CM', 'Walker P', 'Slavin MA', 'Ananda-Rajah MR', 'Morrissey CO', 'Urbancic KF', 'Grigg A', 'Spencer A', 'Szer J', 'Seymour JF', 'Kong DC']","['Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Malignant Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Service, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Victorian Infectious Diseases Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'General Medicine Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Malignant Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Service, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Infectious Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Haematology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pharmacy Department, Austin Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Infectious Diseases Department, Austin Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Clinical Haematology, Austin Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Malignant Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Service, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Haematology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Clinical Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia david.kong@monash.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151030,England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Chemoprevention/economics/*methods', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/11/01 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/11/01 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['dkv343 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkv343 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2016 Feb;71(2):497-505. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkv343.

The strong transforming activity of Trib1 depends on its bi-directional function in CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPalpha) degradation and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. TRIB1 is also involved in a certain type of human AML and a TRIB1 somatic point mutation R107L was identified in a case of Down syndrome (DS)-related acute megakaryocytic leukaemia.

These members share a Trb (tribbles) domain, which is homologous to protein serine-threonine kinases, but lack the active site lysine. The tribbles proteins interact and modulate the activity of signal transduction pathways in a number of physiological and pathological processes. TRIB2 has been identified as an oncogene that inactivates the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and causes acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Recent research provided compelling evidence that TRIB2 can also act as oncogenic driver in solid tumours, such as lung and liver cancer. In particular, our recent work demonstrated that TRIB2 is dramatically overexpressed in malignant melanomas compared with normal skin and promotes the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells via the down-regulation of FOXO (forkhead box protein O) tumour suppressor activity in vitro and in vivo. TRIB2 was found to be expressed in normal skin, but its expression consistently increased in benign nevi, melanoma and was highest in samples from patients with malignant melanoma. The observation that TRIB2 strongly correlates with the progression of melanocyte-derived malignancies suggests TRIB2 as a meaningful biomarker to both diagnose and stage melanoma. In addition, interfering with TRIB2 activity might be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of several different tumour types.","['Link, Wolfgang']",['Link W'],"['Centre for Biomedical Research (CBMR), University of Algarve, Campus of Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal Regenerative Medicine Program, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Medicine, University of Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Melanoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism']",2015/11/01 06:00,2016/09/01 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['BST20150102 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20150102 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2015 Oct;43(5):1085-8. doi: 10.1042/BST20150102.,,,,['(c) 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.'],['NOTNLM'],"['FOXO (forkhead box protein O)', 'TRIB2 (tribbles homolog 2)', 'biomarker', 'melanoma', 'phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)', 'tribbles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent human genetic studies, as well as molecular biological approaches, have implicated this intriguing protein in the aetiology of multiple human diseases, including myeloid leukaemia, Crohn's disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), dyslipidaemia and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have repeatedly identified variants at the genomic TRIB1 locus as being significantly associated with multiple plasma lipid traits and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans. The involvement of TRIB1 in hepatic lipid metabolism has been validated through viral-mediated hepatic overexpression of the gene in mice; increasing levels of TRIB1 decreased plasma lipids in a dose-dependent manner. Additional studies have implicated TRIB1 in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and NAFLD. The exact mechanisms of TRIB1 regulation of both plasma lipids and hepatic lipogenesis remain undetermined, although multiple signalling pathways and transcription factors have been implicated in tribbles-1 function. Recent reports have been aimed at developing TRIB1-based lipid therapeutics. In summary, tribbles-1 is an important modulator of human energy metabolism and metabolic syndromes and worthy of future studies aimed at investigating its potential as a therapeutic target.","['Bauer, Robert C', 'Yenilmez, Batuhan O', 'Rader, Daniel J']","['Bauer RC', 'Yenilmez BO', 'Rader DJ']","['Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA rcbauer@mail.med.upenn.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (TRIB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism/genetics/*physiology', 'Lipids/blood', 'Lipogenesis/genetics/physiology', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",2015/11/01 06:00,2016/09/01 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['BST20150101 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20150101 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2015 Oct;43(5):1079-84. doi: 10.1042/BST20150101.,['R01-HL109489/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4613491,,['(c) 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.'],['NOTNLM'],"['GWAS', 'Trib1', 'Tribbles', 'cardiovascular disease', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipoproteins']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) upregulates expression of TGF-beta1, promoting collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, and ATO binds directly to PML to induce oligomerization, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. However, how ATO upregulates TGF-beta1 expression is uncertain. Thus, we suggested that PML sumoylation is responsible for regulation of TGF-beta1 protein expression. METHODS: Kunming mice were treated with ATO, and osteoblasts were counted under scanning electron microscopy. Masson's staining was used to quantify collagen content. hFOB1.19 cells were transfected with siRNA against UBC9 or RNF4, and then treated with ATO or FBS. TGF-beta1, PML expression, and sumoylation were quantified with Western blot, and collagen quantified via immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: ATO enhanced osteoblast accumulation, collagen synthesis, and PML-NB formation in vivo. Knocking down UBC9 in hFOB1.19 cells inhibited ATO- and FBS-induced PML sumoylation, TGF-beta1 expression, and collagen synthesis. Conversely, knocking down RNF4 enhanced ATO- and FBS-induced PML sumoylation, TGF-beta1 expression, and collagen synthesis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that PML sumoylation is required for ATO-induced collagen synthesis in osteoblasts.","['Xu, Wen-Xiao', 'Liu, Sheng-Zhi', 'Wu, Di', 'Qiao, Guo-Fen', 'Yan, Jinglong']","['Xu WX', 'Liu SZ', 'Wu D', 'Qiao GF', 'Yan J']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151102,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'Femur/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Sumoylation/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/08/23 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000438525 [pii]', '10.1159/000438525 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;37(4):1581-91. doi: 10.1159/000438525.

We previously reported a germline deletion polymorphism in the BIM gene that was sufficient to mediate intrinsic resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as well as other cancers [1]. The deletion polymorphism favored the generation of BIM splice forms lacking the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain, conferring a relative resistance to the TKI imatinib (IM). However, CML patients with the BIM deletion polymorphism developed both partial and complete IM resistance. To understand the mechanisms underlying the latter, we grew CML cells either with or without the BIM deletion polymorphism in increasing IM concentrations. Under these conditions, the BIM deletion polymorphism enhanced the emergence of populations with complete IM resistance, mimicking the situation in patients. Importantly, the combined use of TKIs with the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 overcame the BCR-ABL1-dependent and -independent resistance mechanisms found in these cells. Our results illustrate the interplay between germline and acquired genetic factors in confering TKI resistance, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for patients with complete TKI resistance associated with the BIM deletion polymorphism.","['Ko, Tun Kiat', 'Chin, Hui San', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Huang, John W J', 'Ng, King-Pan', 'Khaw, Seong Lin', 'Huang, David C S', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Ko TK', 'Chin HS', 'Chuah CT', 'Huang JW', 'Ng KP', 'Khaw SL', 'Huang DC', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Present address: Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Brenner Centre for Molecular Medicine, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Present address: Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/11/12 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['5436 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5436 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jan 19;7(3):2721-33. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5436.,,PMC4823067,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'BH3 mimetic', 'BIM deletion polymorphism', 'CML', 'TKI resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to generate a simple gene expression signature as a predictor of clinical outcome through analyzing the mRNA arrays of 158 de novo CN AML patients. We compared the gene expression profiles of patients with poor response to induction chemotherapy with those who responded well. Forty-six genes expressed differentially between the two groups. Among them, expression of 11 genes was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in univariate Cox regression analysis in 104 patients who received standard intensive chemotherapy. We integrated the z-transformed expression levels of these 11 genes to generate a risk scoring system. Higher risk scores were significantly associated with shorter OS (median 17.0 months vs. not reached, P < 0.001) in ours and another 3 validation cohorts. In addition, it was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (HR 1.116, 95% CI 1.035~1.204, P = 0.004).

In particular, a limited number of studies have assessed the use of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, which is generally considered less informative than May-Giemsa staining. In the current study, the utility of bone marrow clot specimens for diagnosis was examined using H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN), including chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia (aCML) lacking Philadelphia chromosome, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), were selected for histological evaluation. H&E stained specimens were advantageous for observation of atypical basophilic staining of the cytoplasm and nucleus related to dysplasia. This finding was significantly supported for both MDS and MDS/MPN (p < 0.05 versus May-Giemsa staining); therefore, we concluded that H&E staining could be used for identification of dysplastic cells. In addition, despite the loss of tissue structure, phosphorylated Stat5 immunostaining was sufficiently useful for the observation of myelodysplastic blasts. Thus, clot specimens are useful for diagnosis of haematopoietic dysplasia by pathologists.","['Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki', 'Aini, Wulamujiang', 'Hiratsuka, Takuya']","['Tsuruyama T', 'Aini W', 'Hiratsuka T']","['1Department of Pathology and Center for Anatomical, Pathological, and Forensic Medical Research, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshidakonoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 2Department of Pathology and Biology of Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University Hospital, Yoshidakonoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'TDQ283MPCW (Eosine Yellowish-(YS))', 'YKM8PY2Z55 (Hematoxylin)']",IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytodiagnosis/*methods', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)', 'Hematoxylin', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/08/31 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAT.0000000000000328 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 2015 Dec;47(7):673-7. doi: 10.1097/PAT.0000000000000328.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a precise combination of different antibodies, immunophenotypic detection of MRD in acute leukaemia can be performed by identifying abnormal combinations or expressions of antigens on malignant cells at diagnosis, during and post treatment. These abnormal phenotypes, referred to as leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) are either absent or expressed at low frequency in normal bone marrow (BM) cells and are used to monitor the behaviour and quantitate the amount of residual disease following treatment. In paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the level of MRD by multiparametric flow cytometry (MPFC) during therapy is recognised as an important predictor of outcome. Although less extensively studied, adult ALL and adult and paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have also demonstrated similar findings. The challenge now is incorporating this information for risk-stratification so that therapy can be tailored individually and ultimately improve outcome while also limiting treatment-related toxicity. In this review we will elaborate on the current and future role of MPFC in MRD in acute leukaemia while also addressing its limitations.","['Lee, Denise', 'Grigoriadis, George', 'Westerman, David']","['Lee D', 'Grigoriadis G', 'Westerman D']","['1Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre 2University of Melbourne 3Department of Clinical Haematology, Monash and Alfred Health 4Alfred Pathology Service 5Southern Clinical School, Monash University 6Centre for Cancer Research, MIMR-PHI of Medical Research, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/08/31 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAT.0000000000000319 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 2015 Dec;47(7):609-21. doi: 10.1097/PAT.0000000000000319.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA sequencing analysis revealed that exon 17 of NUP214 (9q34) was fused to exon 2 of RAC1 (7p22). We also detected that the 5'-end of intron 1 of RAC1 was fused with the antisense strand of intron 5 of COL12A1 (6q13). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of DEK-NUP214, NUP214-RAC1, RAC1-COL12A1, NUP214, and RAC1. These results suggest that the 5'- and 3'-ends of NUP214 from the breakpoint in the same locus were fused to RAC1 and DEK, respectively, and the 5'-end of RAC1 was fused to COL12A1. The reading frame of NUP214 was not matched with RAC1; however, high expression of the RAC1 protein was detected by Western blotting. This study identifies the variant complex fusion genesNUP214-RAC1 and RAC1- COL12A1 in a case of AML.","['Abe, Akihiro', 'Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Iba, Sachiko', 'Okamoto, Akinao', 'Tokuda, Masutaka', 'Inaguma, Yoko', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Kanie, Tadaharu', 'Tsuzuki, Motohiro', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Mizuta, Shuichi', 'Okamoto, Masataka', 'Kameyama, Toshiki', 'Mayeda, Akila', 'Emi, Nobuhiko']","['Abe A', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Iba S', 'Okamoto A', 'Tokuda M', 'Inaguma Y', 'Yanada M', 'Morishima S', 'Kanie T', 'Tsuzuki M', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Mizuta S', 'Okamoto M', 'Kameyama T', 'Mayeda A', 'Emi N']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151031,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,"['0 (COL12A1 protein, human)', '0 (Collagen Type XII)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Collagen Type XII/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Spectral Karyotyping', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*genetics']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['000441464 [pii]', '10.1159/000441464 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2015;146(4):279-84. doi: 10.1159/000441464.

Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) represent the main population in CLL marrow stroma, which may play a key role for disease support and progression. In this study we evaluated whether MSCs influence in vitro CLL cell survival. MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of 46 CLL patients and were characterized by flow cytometry analysis. Following co-culture of MSCs and leukemic B cells, we demonstrated that MSCs were able to improve leukemic B cell viability, this latter being differently dependent from the signals coming from MSCs. In addition, we found that the co-culture of MSCs with leukemic B cells induced an increased production of IL-8, CCL4, CCL11, and CXCL10 chemokines.As far as drug resistance is concerned, MSCs counteract the cytotoxic effect of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide administration in vivo, whereas they do not protect CLL cells from the apoptosis induced by the kinase inhibitors Bafetinib and Ibrutinib. The evidence that leukemic clones are conditioned by environmental stimuli suggest new putative targets for therapy in CLL patients.","['Trimarco, Valentina', 'Ave, Elisa', 'Facco, Monica', 'Chiodin, Giorgia', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Lessi, Federica', 'Giorgi, Carlo Alberto', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Castelli, Monica', 'Severin, Filippo', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Trimarco V', 'Ave E', 'Facco M', 'Chiodin G', 'Frezzato F', 'Martini V', 'Gattazzo C', 'Lessi F', 'Giorgi CA', 'Visentin A', 'Castelli M', 'Severin F', 'Zambello R', 'Piazza F', 'Semenzato G', 'Trentin L']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'NVW4Z03I9B (bafetinib)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/09/28 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['6239 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6239 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 8;6(39):42130-49. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6239.,,PMC4747215,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'kinase inhibitors', 'mesenchymal stromal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the pattern of sFRP2 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unclear. METHODS: This study aimed to validate the prognostic significance of sFRP2 expression in 54 older patients with cytogenetic normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: sFRP2 expression was decreased markedly in patients compared with controls (P < 0.001). No correlation was found between sFRP2 gene expression and WBCs, hemoglobin, platelets, FAB type, NMP1 and FLT3/ITD mutations at diagnosis. All patients were treated with standard induction chemotherapy. Patients with high sFRP2 expression had higher incidence of complete remission rate (P = 0.04) and better overall survival (P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis revealed that high sFRP2 expression was a prognostic factor for older patients with CN-AML. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that sFRP2 gene expression at diagnosis had an impact on outcome of elderly CN-AML patients.","['Aly, Rabab M', 'Taalab, Mona M', 'Abdsalam, Eman M']","['Aly RM', 'Taalab MM', 'Abdsalam EM']","['Clinical Pathology Department (RMA), Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt; Clinical Hematology unit (MMT), Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt; and General Medicine Department (EMA), Faculty of medicine for girls, Alazhar University, Cairo, Egypt.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SFRP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Statistics as Topic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000567 [doi]', 'S0002-9629(15)41326-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2015 Nov;350(5):369-73. doi: 10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000567.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MYC binding protein 2 (MYCBP2) is a probable E3 ubiquitin ligase and its function in leukemia is unknown. IKZF1 deletion is associated with the development and poor outcome of ALL. Here, we observed significant high c-MYC expression and low MYCBP2 expression in adult ALL patients. Patients with high c-MYC expression and/or low MYCBP2 expression had higher WBC counts and a higher percentage of CD34+ or CD33+ cells, as well as splenomegaly, liver infiltration, higher BM blasts, and lower CR rate. Ikaros bound to the regulatory regions of c-MYC and MYCBP2, suppressed c-MYC and increased MYCBP2 expression in ALL cells. Expression of c-MYC mRNA was significantly higher in patients with IKZF1 deletion; conversely MYCBP2 mRNA expression was significantly lower in those patients. A CK2 inhibitor, which acts as an Ikaros activator, also suppressed c-MYC and increased MYCBP2 expression in an Ikaros (IKZF1) dependent manner in the ALL cells. In summary, our data indicated the correlation of high c-MYC expression, low MYCBP2 expression and high c-MYC plus low MYCBP2 expression with high-risk factors and proliferation markers in adult ALL patients. Our data also revealed an oncogenic role for an Ikaros/MYCBP2/c-MYC axis in adult ALL, providing a mechanism of target therapies that activate Ikaros in adult ALL.","['Ge, Zheng', 'Guo, Xing', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Hartman, Melanie', 'Kawasawa, Yuka Imamura', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Song, Chunhua']","['Ge Z', 'Guo X', 'Li J', 'Hartman M', 'Kawasawa YI', 'Dovat S', 'Song C']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Pharmacology, Institute for Personalized Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MYCBP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/09/28 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['5982 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5982 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 8;6(39):42300-11. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5982.,,PMC4747226,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Ikaros', 'MYCBP2', 'adult leukemia', 'c-MYC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a case of a 61-year-old woman with B-LBL associated with these cytogenetic alterations and present a review of the literature of this disease. METHODS: Four-color flow cytometry (FC) was performed on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. Data were analyzed with BD FACSDiva software. Cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular studies were performed by conventional methods. A review of the literature was performed by a PubMed-assisted search. RESULTS: Including our case, eight B-LBLs associated with a documented ""double-hit"" karyotype (IGH/BCL2 and 8q24/MYC rearrangement) were identified in the literature (male/female 2/6, age 15-65). Three occurred de-novo, and five had a history of a CD10+ B-cell lymphoma. The typical immunophenotype was CD10, CD19, TdT positive, and negative for CD34 and surface immunoglobulin (Ig), established either by FC or immunohistochemistry. Seven cases were CD20-, and one case was CD20+. Translocation partners of MYC varied, and included IGH, lambda light chain, and an unknown gene on chromosome 9. Prognosis was poor with median survival of five months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with B-LBL associated with a combined IGH/BCL2 and MYC rearrangement often have a history of a mature B-cell lymphoma. The immunophenotype of these cases is different from that of mature ""double-hit"" lymphomas; FC is essential to differentiate the B-LBL cases from the leukemic phase of mature B-cell lymphomas.

The promoter of miR-3151 was methylated in 5/7 (71%) CLL cell lines, 30/98 (31%) diagnostic primary samples, but not normal controls. Methylation of miR-3151 correlated inversely with expression. Treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine led to promoter demethylation and miR-3151 re-expression. Luciferase assay confirmed MAP-kinase activating death domain (MADD) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 2 (PIK3R2) as direct targets of miR-3151. Moreover, restoration of miR-3151 resulted in inhibition of cellular proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, repression of MADD and PIK3R2, downregulation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling, and repression of MCL1. Lastly, miR-3151 methylation was significantly associated with methylation of miR-203 and miR-34b/c in primary CLL samples. Therefore, this study showed that miR-3151 is a tumor suppressive miRNA frequently hypermethylated and hence silenced in CLL. miR-3151 silencing by DNA methylation protected CLL cells from apoptosis through over-expression of its direct targets MADD and PIK3R2, hence constitutive activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling respectively, and consequently over-expression of MCL1.","['Wang, Lu Qian', 'Wong, Kwan Yeung', 'Rosen, Anders', 'Chim, Chor Sang']","['Wang LQ', 'Wong KY', 'Rosen A', 'Chim CS']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (MADD protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN203 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN3151 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (phosphoinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit 2, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Asians/genetics', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'China', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['6251 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6251 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 29;6(42):44422-36. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6251.,,PMC4792566,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'miR-3151', 'microRNA', 'tumor suppressor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus suppressing the production of TNF-alpha is important because TNF-alpha can auto-regulate own expression through activation of NF-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In this study, we focused on the inhibitory effect of IL-32theta on TNF-alpha production in acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately 38% of patients with AML express endogenous IL-32theta, which is not expressed in healthy individuals. Furthermore, plasma samples were classified into groups with or without IL-32theta; then, we measured proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels. TNF-alpha production was not increased in patients with IL-32theta expression than that in the no-IL-32theta group. Using an IL-32theta stable expression system in leukemia cell lines, we found that IL-32theta attenuated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced TNF-alpha production. IL-32theta inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which are key positive regulators of TNF-alpha expression, and inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Moreover, the presence of IL-32theta attenuated TNF-alpha promoter activity and the binding of NF-kappaB with the TNF-alpha promoter. In addition, IL-32gamma-induced TNF-alpha production has no correlation with inhibition of TNF-alpha via IL-32theta expression. Thus, IL-32theta may serve as a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha in patients with AML.","['Kim, Man Sub', 'Kang, Jeong-Woo', 'Jeon, Jae-Sik', 'Kim, Jae Kyung', 'Kim, Jong Wan', 'Hong, Jintae', 'Yoon, Do-Young']","['Kim MS', 'Kang JW', 'Jeon JS', 'Kim JK', 'Kim JW', 'Hong J', 'Yoon DY']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Current address: Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Dankook University College of Health Sciences, Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Medical Research Center, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, Korea.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['5688 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5688 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 1;6(38):40747-61. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5688.,,PMC4747366,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-32', 'NF-kappaB', 'TNF-alpha', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although FMRP is highly expressed in neurons, it has also recently been identified in glia. It has been postulated that in the absence of FMRP, abnormal function of non-neuronal cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. We previously demonstrated reduced numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and delayed myelination in the cerebellum of fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice. METHODS: We used quantitative western blotting and immunocytochemistry to examine the status of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebellum of Fmr1 mice during development and in adulthood. RESULTS: We report increased expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP in the cerebellum of Fmr1 mice starting in the second postnatal week and persisting in to adulthood. At 2 weeks postnatal, expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (TNFR2) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) were elevated in the Fmr1 KO cerebellum. In adults, expression of TNFR2 and the glial marker S100beta were also elevated in Fmr1 knockouts, but LIF expression was not different from wild-type mice. We found no evidence of microglial activation or neuroinflammation at any age examined. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an atypical pattern of astrogliosis in the absence of microglial activation in Fmr1 knockout mouse cerebellum. Enhanced TNFR2 and LIF expression in young mice suggests that changes in the expression of astrocytic proteins may be an attempt to compensate for delayed myelination in the developing cerebellum of Fmr1 mice.","['Pacey, Laura K K', 'Guan, Sihui', 'Tharmalingam, Sujeenthar', 'Thomsen, Christian', 'Hampson, David R']","['Pacey LK', 'Guan S', 'Tharmalingam S', 'Thomsen C', 'Hampson DR']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2.', 'Department of Neuroinflammation Lundbeck Research USA 215 College Road Paramus New Jersey 07652.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2 ; Department of Pharmacology Faculty of Medicine University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150925,United States,Brain Behav,Brain and behavior,101570837,"['0 (Fmr1 protein, mouse)', '139135-51-6 (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Autistic Disorder/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cerebellum/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Fragile X Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neuroglia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurons/metabolism/*pathology']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/08/24 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/brb3.400 [doi]', 'BRB3400 [pii]']",epublish,Brain Behav. 2015 Sep 25;5(10):e00400. doi: 10.1002/brb3.400. eCollection 2015 Oct.,,PMC4614053,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Astrogliosis', 'FMRP', 'GFAP', 'LIF', 'S100B', 'TNFR2', 'autism', 'myelin', 'oligodendrocyte precursor cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis in relapse patients revealed that the distribution of CDKN2 deletion is higher in relapse patients (44.6%) than all patients (28.4%, P=0.006). Deletion of CDKN2 was significantly associated with poor outcomes including decreased overall survival (OS) (P<0.001), lower disease free-survival (DFS) (P<0.001), and increased cumulative incidence of relapse (P=0.002); Also, CDKN2 deletion was strongly associated with IGH translocation (P=0.021); and had an adverse effect on patients with BCR-ABL fusion gene or with MLL rearrangement.

With the application of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), APL becomes one of best prognosis of leukemia. However, ATRA and ATO are not effective against all APLs. Therefore, a new strategy for APL treatment is necessary. Here, we investigated whether lithium chloride (LiCl), a drug used for the treatment of mental illness, could promote apoptosis in human leukemia NB4 cells. We observed that treatment with LiCl significantly accelerated apoptosis in NB4 cells and led to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Moreover, LiCl significantly increased the level of Ser9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta(p-GSK-3beta), and decreased the level of Akt1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, LiCl inhibition of c-Myc also enhanced cell death with a concomitant increase in beta-catnin. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that LiCl promoted apoptosis in NB4 cells through the Akt signaling pathway and that G2/M phase arrest was induced by increase of p-GSK-3beta(S9).","['Li, Liu', 'Song, Hao', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Yang, Rong', 'Yang, Xiao-Qun', 'Jiang, Kai-Ling', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong']","['Li L', 'Song H', 'Zhong L', 'Yang R', 'Yang XQ', 'Jiang KL', 'Liu BZ']","['1.

For example, cocktails of cytotoxic agents, which were carefully designed based on mechanisms of action, dose, and scheduling considerations, have led to dramatic improvements in survival including cures for childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and several other complex cancers. Outcome for glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant CNS cancer, has been more modest, but nonetheless our current standard of care derives from confirmation that combination therapy surpasses single modality therapy. Immunotherapy has recently come of age for medical oncology with exciting therapeutic benefits achieved by several types of agents including vaccines, adoptive T cells, and immune checkpoint inhibitors against several types of cancers. Nonetheless, most benefits are relatively short, while others are durable but are limited to a minority of treated patients. Critical factors limiting efficacy of immunotherapeutics include insufficient immunogenicity and/or inadequate ability to overcome immunosuppressive factors exploited by tumors. The paradigm of rationally designed combinatorial regimens, originally established by cytotoxic therapy for oncology, may also prove relevant for immunotherapy. Realization of the true therapeutic potential of immunotherapy for medical oncology and neuro-oncology patients may require development of combinatorial regimens that optimize immunogenicity and target tumor adaptive immunosuppressive factors.","['Reardon, David A', 'Gilbert, Mark R', 'Wick, Wolfgang', 'Liau, Linda']","['Reardon DA', 'Gilbert MR', 'Wick W', 'Liau L']","[""Center of Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland (M.R.G.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Tumor Diseases, University of Heidelberg and German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany (W.W); Brain Tumor Program, Department of Neurosurgery, University of California Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California (L.L.)."", ""Center of Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland (M.R.G.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Tumor Diseases, University of Heidelberg and German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany (W.W); Brain Tumor Program, Department of Neurosurgery, University of California Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California (L.L.)."", ""Center of Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland (M.R.G.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Tumor Diseases, University of Heidelberg and German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany (W.W); Brain Tumor Program, Department of Neurosurgery, University of California Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California (L.L.)."", ""Center of Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts (D.A.R.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland (M.R.G.); Neurology Clinic and National Center for Tumor Diseases, University of Heidelberg and German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany (W.W); Brain Tumor Program, Department of Neurosurgery, University of California Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California (L.L.).""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/*therapy']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['nov178 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/nov178 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2015 Nov;17 Suppl 7:vii32-vii40. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nov178.,,PMC4625894,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2015.

HPV oncogenes are major drivers of the transformed phenotype, and the cancers remain addicted to these oncogenes. A screen of the human kinome has identified inhibition of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) as being synthetically lethal on the background of HPV E7 expression. The investigational AURKA inhibitor MLN8237/Alisertib selectively promoted apoptosis in the HPV cancers. The apoptosis was driven by an extended mitotic delay in the Alisertib-treated HPV E7-expressing cells. This had the effect of reducing Mcl-1 levels, which is destabilized in mitosis, and increasing BIM levels, normally destabilized by Aurora A in mitosis. Overexpression of Mcl-1 reduced sensitivity to the drug. The level of HPV E7 expression influenced the extent of Alisertib-induced mitotic delay and Mcl-1 reduction. Xenograft experiments with three cervical cancer cell lines showed Alisertib inhibited growth of HPV and non-HPV xenografts during treatment. Growth of non-HPV tumors was delayed, but in two separate HPV cancer cell lines, regression with no resumption of growth was detected, even at 50 days after treatment. A transgenic model of premalignant disease driven solely by HPV E7 also demonstrated sensitivity to drug treatment. Here, we show for the first time that targeting of the Aurora A kinase in mice using drugs such as Alisertib results in a curative sterilizing therapy that may be useful in treating HPV-driven cancers.","['Gabrielli, Brian', 'Bokhari, Fawzi', 'Ranall, Max V', 'Oo, Zay Yar', 'Stevenson, Alexander J', 'Wang, Weili', 'Murrell, Melanie', 'Shaikh, Mushfiq', 'Fallaha, Sora', 'Clarke, Daniel', 'Kelly, Madison', 'Sedelies, Karin', 'Christensen, Melinda', 'McKee, Sara', 'Leggatt, Graham', 'Leo, Paul', 'Skalamera, Dubravka', 'Soyer, H Peter', 'Gonda, Thomas J', 'McMillan, Nigel A J']","['Gabrielli B', 'Bokhari F', 'Ranall MV', 'Oo ZY', 'Stevenson AJ', 'Wang W', 'Murrell M', 'Shaikh M', 'Fallaha S', 'Clarke D', 'Kelly M', 'Sedelies K', 'Christensen M', 'McKee S', 'Leggatt G', 'Leo P', 'Skalamera D', 'Soyer HP', 'Gonda TJ', 'McMillan NA']","['The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. brianG@uq.edu.au n.mcmillan@griffith.edu.au.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Mater Research, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Mater Research, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Dermatology Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. brianG@uq.edu.au n.mcmillan@griffith.edu.au.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151029,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Azepines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MLN 8237)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Papillomavirus E7 Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Azepines/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Papillomaviridae/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Papillomavirus E7 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/virology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-15-0506 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0506 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2015 Dec;14(12):2753-61. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0506.

We detected hemizygous deletions spanning the CD19 locus and de novo frameshift and missense mutations in exon 2 of CD19 in some relapse samples. However, we also discovered alternatively spliced CD19 mRNA species, including one lacking exon 2. Pull-down/siRNA experiments identified SRSF3 as a splicing factor involved in exon 2 retention, and its levels were lower in relapsed B-ALL. Using genome editing, we demonstrated that exon 2 skipping bypasses exon 2 mutations in B-ALL cells and allows expression of the N-terminally truncated CD19 variant, which fails to trigger killing by CART-19 but partly rescues defects associated with CD19 loss. Thus, this mechanism of resistance is based on a combination of deleterious mutations and ensuing selection for alternatively spliced RNA isoforms. SIGNIFICANCE: CART-19 yield 70% response rates in patients with B-ALL, but also produce escape variants. We discovered that the underlying mechanism is the selection for preexisting alternatively spliced CD19 isoforms with the compromised CART-19 epitope. This mechanism suggests a possibility of targeting alternative CD19 ectodomains, which could improve survival of patients with B-cell neoplasms.","['Sotillo, Elena', 'Barrett, David M', 'Black, Kathryn L', 'Bagashev, Asen', 'Oldridge, Derek', 'Wu, Glendon', 'Sussman, Robyn', 'Lanauze, Claudia', 'Ruella, Marco', 'Gazzara, Matthew R', 'Martinez, Nicole M', 'Harrington, Colleen T', 'Chung, Elaine Y', 'Perazzelli, Jessica', 'Hofmann, Ted J', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Raman, Pichai', 'Barrera, Alejandro', 'Gill, Saar', 'Lacey, Simon F', 'Melenhorst, Jan J', 'Allman, David', 'Jacoby, Elad', 'Fry, Terry', 'Mackall, Crystal', 'Barash, Yoseph', 'Lynch, Kristen W', 'Maris, John M', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko, Andrei']","['Sotillo E', 'Barrett DM', 'Black KL', 'Bagashev A', 'Oldridge D', 'Wu G', 'Sussman R', 'Lanauze C', 'Ruella M', 'Gazzara MR', 'Martinez NM', 'Harrington CT', 'Chung EY', 'Perazzelli J', 'Hofmann TJ', 'Maude SL', 'Raman P', 'Barrera A', 'Gill S', 'Lacey SF', 'Melenhorst JJ', 'Allman D', 'Jacoby E', 'Fry T', 'Mackall C', 'Barash Y', 'Lynch KW', 'Maris JM', 'Grupp SA', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko A']","[""Division of Cancer Pathobiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Cancer Pathobiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Cancer Pathobiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Cancer Pathobiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Primary objective was to describe the impact of clinical trial registration on sterile site microbiologically documented infection for children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We conducted a multicenter cohort study that included children aged </=18 years with de novo AML. Primary outcome was microbiologically documented sterile site infection. Infection rates were compared between those registered and not registered on clinical trials. Five hundred seventy-four children with AML were included of which 198 (34.5%) were registered on a therapeutic clinical trial. Overall, 400 (69.7%) had at least one sterile site microbiologically documented infection. In multiple regression, registration on clinical trials was independently associated with a higher risk of microbiologically documented sterile site infection [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.53; p = 0.040] and viridans group streptococcal infection (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98; p = 0.015). Registration on trials was not associated with Gram-negative or invasive fungal infections. Children with newly diagnosed AML enrolled on clinical trials have a higher risk of microbiologically documented sterile site infection.

An etiologic role for ionizing radiation in CLL is controversial. Because most of the ionizing radiation to which individuals are exposed comes from radon at home, we examined CLL incidence rates in relation to residential radon levels. METHODS: We used population-based rates for CLL for US states from 2007 to 2011 and measurements of residential radon made by the US Environmental Protection Agency. RESULTS: Incidence rates for CLL were significantly correlated with residential radon levels among whites (both genders together and each gender separately; p < 0.005) and among blacks (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We speculate that radon increases CLL risk and that the mechanisms may be similar to those by which radon causes lung cancer.","['Schwartz, Gary G', 'Klug, Marilyn G']","['Schwartz GG', 'Klug MG']","['Department of Population Health, University of North Dakota School of Medicine & Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND 58202, USA.', 'Department of Family Medicine & Center for Rural Health, University of North Dakota School of Medicine & Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND 58202, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151030,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens, Environmental', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Population Surveillance', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/fon.15.275 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2016 Jan;12(2):165-74. doi: 10.2217/fon.15.275.

Upon FLT3 inhibition, CDC25A mRNA and protein were rapidly down-regulated, while levels of other cell cycle proteins remained unchanged. This regulation was dependent on STAT5, arguing for FLT3-ITD-dependent transcriptional regulation of CDC25A. CDC25 inhibitors triggered proliferation arrest and cell death of FLT3-ITD as well as FLT3-ITD/TKD AC-220 resistant cells, but not of FLT3-wt cells. Consistently, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of CDC25A reduced the proliferation of FLT3-ITD cell lines. Finally, the clonogenic capacity of primary FLT3-ITD AML cells was reduced by the CDC25 inhibitor IRC-083864, while FLT3-wt AML and normal CD34+ myeloid cells were unaffected. In good agreement, in a cohort of 100 samples from AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, high levels of CDC25A mRNA were predictive of higher clonogenic potential in FLT3-ITD+ samples, not in FLT3-wt ones.Importantly, pharmacological inhibition as well as RNA interference-mediated knock-down of CDC25A also induced monocytic differentiation of FLT3-ITD positive cells, as judged by cell surface markers expression, morphological modifications, and C/EBPalpha phosphorylation. CDC25 inhibition also re-induced monocytic differentiation in primary AML blasts carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation, but not in blasts expressing wild type FLT3. Altogether, these data identify CDC25A as an early cell cycle transducer of FLT3-ITD oncogenic signaling, and as a promising target to inhibit proliferation and re-induce differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells.","['Bertoli, Sarah', 'Boutzen, Helena', 'David, Laure', 'Larrue, Clement', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Fernandez-Vidal, Anne', 'Yuan, Lingli', 'Hospital, Marie-Anne', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Galcera, Marie-Odile', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Didier, Christine', 'Dozier, Christine', 'Recher, Christian', 'Manenti, Stephane']","['Bertoli S', 'Boutzen H', 'David L', 'Larrue C', 'Vergez F', 'Fernandez-Vidal A', 'Yuan L', 'Hospital MA', 'Tamburini J', 'Demur C', 'Delabesse E', 'Saland E', 'Sarry JE', 'Galcera MO', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Didier C', 'Dozier C', 'Recher C', 'Manenti S']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Inserm UMR 1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse -

Here, we show that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) desensitize ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells to the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. In search for the mechanism, we found that MSCs and CAFs similarly increased the activity of the PI3K/AKT and the JAK/STAT3 pathways and upregulated the expression of integrin beta1, IGF1R, HIF1alpha, CAIX and Bcl-3 in MCF-7 cells. Further analyses revealed that MSCs and CAFs coordinately induce these changes by triggering the downregulation of IGFBP5. Loss of IGFBP5 in MCF-7 cells was an early and long-lasting event in response to MSCs and CAFs and was accompanied by growth stimulation both in the absence and presence of fulvestrant. The growth-stimulatory effect in the absence of fulvestrant could be attributed to PI3K/AKT pathway activation and could be mimicked by insulin. The growth-promoting effect in the presence of fulvestrant depended upon the upregulation of Bcl-3. By cRNA microarray analysis we identified additional IGFBP5 targets, of which two (KLHL4 and SEPP1) were inversely regulated by IGFBP5 and Bcl-3. BT474 cells also responded to stromal cells by downregulating IGFBP5 and upregulating the P-AKT, Bcl-3 and IGF1R levels, whereas T47D cells did not show any of these responses. In conclusion, our data suggest that, by targeting IGFBP5 expression in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7 cells, MSCs and CAFs are able to orchestrate a variety of events, particularly activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, upregulation of Bcl-3 expression and desensitization to anti-estrogen.","['Leyh, Benjamin', 'Dittmer, Angela', 'Lange, Theresia', 'Martens, John W M', 'Dittmer, Jurgen']","['Leyh B', 'Dittmer A', 'Lange T', 'Martens JW', 'Dittmer J']","['Clinic for Gynecology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle(Saale), Germany.', 'Clinic for Gynecology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle(Saale), Germany.', 'Clinic for Gynecology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle(Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Clinic for Gynecology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle(Saale), Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/*pathology', 'Fulvestrant', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5/*metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['5624 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5624 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Nov 17;6(36):39307-28. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5624.,,PMC4770774,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-estrogen resistance', 'carcinoma-associated fibroblasts', 'fulvestrant', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'stromal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One mechanistic model of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is attributed to the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, this theory has been questioned because several cardioprotective strategies have included the use of antioxidants without significant clinical benefit. We sought to determine whether measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species after anthracycline exposure in vivo and in vitro could provide a means for designing more effective antioxidant-based cardioprotective schemes. METHODS: Intracellular levels of ROS were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from leukemia bearing mice exposed to anthracyclines and in patients receiving anthracyclines. Comparison of cell death induction and ROS levels were also conducted in vitro in cardiomyocyte and leukemia lines. ROS blockade using antioxidants was conducted, and effects on cell death were assessed. RESULTS: Elevated ROS in blood of mice and representative patient samples correlated with cardiomyocyte necrosis and decreased ejection fraction. In vitro, comparison of the cytotoxic effects of anthracyclines in acute leukemia cells and in cardiomyocytes revealed distinct kinetics of cell death induction and dependence upon oxidative stress. Although apoptotic cell death was observed in both acute leukemia cells and cardiomyocytes, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine protected cardiomyocytes but not acute leukemia cells from anthracycline cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point toward revisiting the use of NAC as a cardioprotective agent since it does not appear to interfere with the cytotoxic action of anthracyclines. NAC has been evaluated clinically for cardioprotective activity but future trials must ensure that adequate dose, scheduling and incorporation of markers of oxidative stress are included.","['Fulbright, Joy Marie', 'Egas-Bejar, Daniela E', 'Huh, Winston W', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Fulbright JM', 'Egas-Bejar DE', 'Huh WW', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0853, Box 853, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0853, Box 853, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Patient Care, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0853, Box 853, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jchandra@mdanderson.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151029,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00280-015-2879-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-015-2879-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Dec;76(6):1297-307. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2879-4.

RESULTS: VMI was significantly associated with written math calculation ability (p < .0069) after adjusting for intelligence (p < .0001). VMI was more strongly associated with math in those with lower intelligence (p = .0141). Word decoding was also significantly associated with VMI but with no effect modification by intelligence. FM skills were not associated with either reading or math achievement. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that VMI is associated with aspects of math and reading achievement in leukemia survivors. These skills may be amenable to intervention.","['Balsamo, Lyn M', 'Sint, Kyaw J', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Brouwers, Pim', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Balsamo LM', 'Sint KJ', 'Neglia JP', 'Brouwers P', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine lyn.balsamo@yale.edu.', 'School of Public Health, Yale University.', 'University of Minnesota Medical School.', 'National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151029,United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,,IM,"['*Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Motor Skills/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*psychology', 'Reading', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jsv103 [pii]', '10.1093/jpepsy/jsv103 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2016 Apr;41(3):319-28. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsv103.

We profiled TP53 and 20 additional genes in our training set of 219 patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia with findings confirmed in a validation cohort. When parsed by VAF, TP53 VAF predicted for complex cytogenetics in both the training (P=0.001) and validation set (P<0.0001). MDS patients with a TP53 VAF > 40% had a median overall survival (OS) of 124 days versus an OS that was not reached in patients with VAF <20% (hazard ratio (HR), 3.52; P=0.01) with validation in an independent cohort (HR, 4.94, P=0.01). TP53 VAF further stratified distinct prognostic groups independent of clinical prognostic scoring systems (P=0.0005). In multivariate analysis, only a TP53 VAF >40% was an independent covariate (HR, 1.61; P<0.0001). In addition, SRSF2 VAF predicted for monocytosis (P=0.003), RUNX1 VAF with thrombocytopenia (P=0.01) and SF3B1 with ringed sideroblasts (P=0.001). Together, our study indicates that VAF should be incorporated in patient management and risk stratification in MDS.","['Sallman, D A', 'Komrokji, R', 'Vaupel, C', 'Cluzeau, T', 'Geyer, S M', 'McGraw, K L', 'Al Ali, N H', 'Lancet, J', 'McGinniss, M J', 'Nahas, S', 'Smith, A E', 'Kulasekararaj, A', 'Mufti, G', 'List, A', 'Hall, J', 'Padron, E']","['Sallman DA', 'Komrokji R', 'Vaupel C', 'Cluzeau T', 'Geyer SM', 'McGraw KL', 'Al Ali NH', 'Lancet J', 'McGinniss MJ', 'Nahas S', 'Smith AE', 'Kulasekararaj A', 'Mufti G', 'List A', 'Hall J', 'Padron E']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Detection of chromosome abnormalities by conventional cytogenetics combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) play a very significant role in assessing risk stratification. Identification of specific chromosome abnormalities has led to the recognition of genetic subgroups based on reciprocal translocations, deletions and modal number in B or T-cell ALL. In the last twelve years 102 newly diagnosed childhood/adult ALL bone marrow samples were analysed for chromosomal abnormalities with conventional G-banding, and FISH (selected cases) using specific probes in our hospital. G-banded karyotype analysis found clonal numerical and/or structural chromosomal aberrations in 74.2% of cases. Patients with pseudodiploidy represented the most frequent group (38.7%) followed by high hyperdiploidy group (12.9%), low hyperdiploidy group (9.7%), hypodiploidy (<46) group (9.7%) and high hypertriploidy group (3.2%). The highest observed numerical chromosomal alteration was high hyperdiploidy (12.9%) with abnormal karyotypes while abnormal 12p (7.5%) was the highest observed structural abnormality followed by t(12;21)(p13.3;q22) resulting in ETV6/RUNX1 fusion (5.4%) and t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) resulting in BCR/ABL1 fusion (4.3%). Interestingly, we identified 16 cases with rare and complex structural aberrations. Application of the FISH technique produced major improvements in the sensitivity and accuracy of cytogenetic analysis with ALL patients. In conclusion it confirmed heterogeneity of ALL by identifying various recurrent chromosomal aberrations along with non-specific rearrangements and their association with specific immunophenotypes.

Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) is highly expressed in patients with acute leukemia. It is found as a tumor associated antigen (TAA) in various types of hematopoietic malignancies and can be employed as a useful marker for targeted immunotherapy and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). In this regard, WT1 is a transcription factor that promotes gene activation or repression depending on cellular and promoter context. The purpose of this study was assessment of WT1 gene expression in patients with acute leukemia, measurement of IL-12 and C3 levels in serum and evaluation of the relationship between them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression of WT1 mRNA using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and serum levels of IL-12 and C3 using ELISA and nephelometry in peripheral blood of 12 newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia and 12 controls. RESULTS: The results of our study showed that the average wT1 gene expression in patients was 7.7 times higher than in healthy controls (P <0.05).

Information on karyotype and associated clinical parameters are essential to physicians for planning cancer control interventions in different geographical regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we present the overall frequency and distribution patterns of chromosomal aberrations in both children and adult de novo B lineage ALL Indian patients using conventional cytogenetics, interphase FISH and multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among the 215 subjects, cytogenetic results were achieved in 172 (80%) patients; normal karyotype represented 37.2% and abnormal 62.8% with a distribution as follows: 15.3% hypodiploidy; 10.3% hyperdiploidy; 15.8% t(9;22); 9.8% t(1;19); 3.7% t(12;21); 2.8% t(4;11); 2.8% complex karyotypes. Apart from these, we observed several novel, rare and common chromosomal rearrangements. Also, FISH studies using LSI extra-signal dual-color probes revealed additional structural or numerical changes. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate cytogenetic heterogeneity of ALL and confirm that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities varies considerably. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest reported series of cytogenetic investigations in Indian B-lineage ALL cases. In addition, ongoing cytogenetic studies are warranted in larger groups of B-lineage ALL cases to identify newly acquired chromosomal abnormalities that may contribute to disease diagnosis and management.","['Bhandari, Prerana', 'Ahmad, Firoz', 'Dalvi, Rupa', 'Koppaka, Neeraja', 'Kokate, Prajakta', 'Das, Bibhu Ranjan', 'Mandava, Swarna']","['Bhandari P', 'Ahmad F', 'Dalvi R', 'Koppaka N', 'Kokate P', 'Das BR', 'Mandava S']","['Research and Development, SRL Ltd., Mumbai, India E-mail : swarna@srl.in.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.16.7219 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(16):7219-29. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.16.7219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing life expectancy and aging population are important factors for increasing cancer incidences in developing countries. National programs are essential for prevention and control of cancer in any society. This study aimed to investigate cancer epidemiology and trends in the province of Hamadan, located in Northwest Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analytical study was carried out based on cancer registry data from 2004 to 2009 in the province of Hamadan, analyzed using STATA (version 12) software for descriptive tests and Join point 4.1.1.1 software for analytical tests. RESULTS: There were 7,767 registered cases of cancer during the 6 years studied. Of the total cases registered, 59.1% (4,592 cases) involved men and 40.9% (3,175 cases) occurred in women. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) increased from 72.9 to 132.0 in males and 48.2 to 115.0 in females during the 6 years of the study (p<0.001). The most common cancers were skin, stomach, breast, bladder, and leukemia. In women, teh most common were breast, skin, stomach, colorectal, and leukemia, in that order, and in men skin, stomach, bladder, leukemia, and prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The cancer incidence is greater in men that women in this region but with increasing trends in both sexes. Planning regarding education in prevention of exposure to risk factors and control strategies is required to decrease the incident cases. Screening programs for common cancers in older age groups might be helpful to reduce the disease impact.","['Zahedi, Atefeh', 'Rafiemanesh, Hosein', 'Enayatrad, Mostafa', 'Ghoncheh, Mahshid', 'Salehiniya, Hamid']","['Zahedi A', 'Rafiemanesh H', 'Enayatrad M', 'Ghoncheh M', 'Salehiniya H']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Faculty of Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran E-mail : alesaleh70@yahoo.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Molecular Epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.16.7189 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(16):7189-93. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.16.7189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The crude extract and its four fractions were evaluated for their total polyphenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and radical scavenging activity using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay. Their cytotoxic activity using WST assay and DNA damage by agarose gel electrophoresis were also evaluated in a human leukemia HL-60 cell line. The findings revealed that F4 had the highest TPC followed by crude extract, F2, F3 and F1. However, the crude extract had the highest TFC followed by F4, F3, F2, and F1. Depending on the values of EC50 and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, F4 possessed the strongest antioxidant activity while F1 and F2 displayed weak antioxidant activity. Further, incubation HL-60 cells with extract/fractions for 24h caused an inhibition of cell viability in a concentration- dependent manner. F3 and F4 exhibited a high antiproliferative activity with a narrow range of IC50 values (45.9 - 48.9 mug/ml). Crude extract exhibited the weakest antiproliferative activity with an IC50 value of 314.89 mug/ml. Analysis of DNA fragmentation displayed DNA degradation in the form of a smear-type pattern upon agarose gel after incubation of HL-60 cells with F3 and F4 for 6 h. Overall, F3 and F4 appear to be good sources of phytochemicals with antioxidant and potential anticancer activities.","['Diab, Kawthar A E', 'Shafik, Reham Ezzat', 'Yasuda, Shin']","['Diab KA', 'Shafik RE', 'Yasuda S']","['Genetics and Cytology Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt E-mail : kawthar_diab@yahoo.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Citrus sinensis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/analysis', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'Fruit', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols/analysis']",2015/10/31 06:00,2016/08/17 06:00,['2015/10/31 06:00'],"['2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.16.7053 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(16):7053-60. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.16.7053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD1-restricted T cells have been proven to be frequent components of the immune system and to recognize exogenous lipids, derived from pathogenic bacteria, as well as cell-endogenous self-lipids.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate immune signalling and inflammation in response to challenge by pathogens. Appreciating the potential of host-directed therapies designed to control autophagy during mycobacterial infection, we focused on the role of miRNAs in regulating M. tuberculosis-induced autophagy in macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that M. tuberculosis infection leads to downregulation of miR-17 and concomitant upregulation of its targets Mcl-1 and STAT3, a transcriptional activator of Mcl-1. Forced expression of miR-17 reduces expression of Mcl-1 and STAT3 and also the interaction between Mcl-1 and Beclin-1. This is directly linked to enhanced autophagy, because Mcl-1 overexpression attenuates the effects of miR-17. At the same time, transfection with a kinase-inactive mutant of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) (an activator of STAT3) augments M. tuberculosis-induced autophagy, and miR-17 overexpression diminishes phosphorylation of PKCdelta, suggesting that an miR-17/PKC delta/STAT3 axis regulates autophagy during M. tuberculosis infection.","['Kumar, Ranjeet', 'Sahu, Sanjaya Kumar', 'Kumar, Manish', 'Jana, Kuladip', 'Gupta, Pushpa', 'Gupta, Umesh D', 'Kundu, Manikuntala', 'Basu, Joyoti']","['Kumar R', 'Sahu SK', 'Kumar M', 'Jana K', 'Gupta P', 'Gupta UD', 'Kundu M', 'Basu J']","['Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700009, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700009, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700009, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700054, India.', 'National Jalma Institute for Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases, Tajganj, Agra, 282006, India.', 'National Jalma Institute for Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases, Tajganj, Agra, 282006, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700009, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700009, India.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151127,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/genetics', 'Beclin-1/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/metabolism/microbiology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/genetics', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tuberculosis/*genetics/microbiology']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cmi.12540 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2016 May;18(5):679-91. doi: 10.1111/cmi.12540.

We evaluated associations of demographic variables (race, ethnicity, language, religion, and diagnosis) with end-of-life characteristics (Phase I enrollment, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, hospice utilization, location of death), and trends in palliative care services delivered to pediatric hematology, oncology, and stem cell transplant (SCT) patients. PROCEDURE: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, inclusion criteria were as follows: patients aged 0-35 who died between January 1, 2002 and March 1, 2014, and had been cared for in the pediatric hematology, oncology, and SCT divisions. The era of 2002-2014 was divided into quartiles to assess trends over time. RESULTS: Of the 445 included patients, 64% of patients had relapsed disease, 45% were enrolled in hospice, and 16% had received palliative care consultation. Patients with brain or solid tumors enrolled in hospice (P < 0.0001) and died at home more frequently than patients with leukemia/lymphoma (P < 0.0001). Patients who received Phase I therapy or identified as Christian/Catholic religion enrolled in hospice more frequently (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.03, respectively). When patient deaths were analyzed over quartiles, the frequency of DNR orders (P = 0.02) and palliative care consultation (P = 0.04) increased over time. Hospice enrollment, location of death, and Phase I trial enrollment did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increases in palliative care consultation and DNR orders over time, utilization remains suboptimal. No increase in hospice enrollment or shift in death location was observed. These data will help target future initiatives to achieve earlier discussions of goals of care and improved palliative care for all patients.","['Brock, Katharine E', 'Steineck, Angela', 'Twist, Clare J']","['Brock KE', 'Steineck A', 'Twist CJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151029,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Hematology/*trends', 'Hospices/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*trends', 'Palliative Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Pediatrics/*trends', 'Religion', 'Resuscitation Orders', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*trends', 'Terminal Care/*trends']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25822 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Mar;63(3):516-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25822.

Whereas treatment with the nucleoside purine analogues cladribine and pentostatin results in lengthy remissions in nearly all patients with HCL, most patients will experience relapse while a small percentage of patients' disease fails to respond to therapy in the first place. Retreatment with a purine nucleoside analogue often leads to an effective but limited response. For decades, few other viable therapeutic options were available to these patients who required retreatment. Recently, new insights into the mechanism of disease of HCL have led to research in new potential treatment agents, either alone or with a purine nucleoside analogue. Clinical trials with rituximab, bendamustine, and conjugate immunotoxins will reveal what role these therapies will have in HCL treatment. A better understanding of the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway and the B-cell signaling pathway has allowed further exploration into the novel drugs vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, and ibrutinib.","['Sarvaria, Aditya', 'Topp, Zheng', 'Saven, Alan']","['Sarvaria A', 'Topp Z', 'Saven A']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Scripps Green Hospital, La Jolla, California.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California.']",,['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Drug Resistance', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/history/metabolism/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/history/*trends', 'Patient Selection', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['2464967 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.4134 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2016 Jan;2(1):123-9. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.4134.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that 42.4% of 51,382 cancer patients used 33 anticancer CPMs, and 51.7% used 71 anticancer Western medicines (WMs). The CPMs were most often used in lung (52%) and nasopharynx (52%) cancer patients, and least in bladder cancer (21%) and leukemia of unspecified cell type (21%) patients. The cost per patient for all 33 anticancer CPMs was 2069RMB, lower than that of the WMs (3458RMB). The cancer profile of commonly used CPMs and WMs for the top 17 cancers (>500 sampled patients) were provided, indicating anticancer CPMs had a broad spectrum of cancers and lacked selectivity in cancer treatment (CPM mean CV = 49%; WM mean CV = 152%). Moreover, 24.8% of the cancer patients used both CPMs and WMs, and CPM-WM combined use networks were constructed for four major cancers. This first nationwide analysis revealed the use characteristics and herb-drug combined use patterns of insurance covered anticancer CPMs in China. The study offers valuable information to guide future studies of the precision, safety and standard use of CPMs.","['Wu, Min', 'Lu, Peng', 'Shi, Luwen', 'Li, Shao']","['Wu M', 'Lu P', 'Shi L', 'Li S']","['Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Division, TNLIST/Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'China', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Utilization Review', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health/*trends', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*trends"", 'Time Factors', 'Urban Health/trends']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['5711 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5711 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Nov 10;6(35):38283-95. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5711.,,PMC4741999,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer treatment', 'herb-drug network', 'medical insurance', 'nationwide survey', 'traditional Chinese medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: The expression of four ABC-transporter genes (ABCA3 encoding drug transporter ABCA3, ABCB1 encoding multidrug resistance protein 1, ABCC3 encoding multidrug resistance-associated protein 3, and ABCG2 encoding breast cancer resistance protein) was measured by TaqMan real time polymerase chain reaction in pretreatment samples from 112 children with AML. Patients were treated according to multicenter study AML-Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich (BFM) 2004. RESULTS: ABCC3 (P = 0.009) and ABCG2 (P = 0.03) were associated with a lower chance to achieve remission after the first course of chemotherapy. ABCC3 was associated with lower relapse free survival (RFS) (P = 0.02). ABCG2 was expressed at higher levels in subtypes of AML with favorable outcome but within standard- and high-risk patients, it was associated with poor outcome (P = 0.02). A strong association was observed between the number of overexpressed ABC-transporters and the chance to achieve remission (P = 0.01) or the chance of RFS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The intensive treatment regimen of AML-BFM 2004 did not readily overcome drug resistance caused by ABC-transporters. Inhibition of ABC-transporters might be particularly useful in patients who express multiple of these genes.","['Bartholomae, Stephan', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Steinbach, Daniel']","['Bartholomae S', 'Gruhn B', 'Debatin KM', 'Zimmermann M', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D', 'Steinbach D']","[""University of Ulm, Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany."", 'Jena University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Jena, Germany.', ""University of Ulm, Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany."", ""Medical School Hannover, Children's Hospital, Hannover, Germany."", ""Medical School Hannover, Children's Hospital, Hannover, Germany."", ""Medical School Hannover, Children's Hospital, Hannover, Germany."", ""University of Ulm, Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151029,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)'],IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25785 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Feb;63(2):242-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25785.

The cohort consists of 4831 men who were dispatched in 1986-1991 for tasks involving decontamination, construction of buildings, transport, radiation measurement, guard duty or other activities. By 31 December 2012, the follow-up of the cohort yielded 102 158 person-years of observation. Exposure and health data were collected by postal questionnaires, biodosimetry evaluations, thyroid screenings, and record-linkages with cancer, causes of death and health insurance reimbursement registers and databases. These data cover socio-demographic factors, employment history, aspects of health behaviour, medical history, work and living conditions in the Chernobyl area, biomarkers of exposure, cancer and non-cancer disease occurrence and causes of death. Cancer incidence data were obtained for 1986-2008, mortality data for 1986-2011 and non-cancer morbidity data for 2004-2012. Although the cohort is relatively small, it has been extensively examined and benefited from comprehensive nationwide population and health registers. The major finding was an increased risk of suicide. Thyroid examinations did not reveal an association with thyroid nodular disease and radiation dose, but did indicate the importance of accounting for screening when making comparisons with unscreened populations. No risk of leukaemia was observed and risks higher than 2.5-fold could be excluded with 95% confidence. Biodosimetry included GPA analyses and chromosomal translocation analyses and indicated that the Estonian cleanup workers experienced a relatively low mean exposure of the order of 0.1 Gy. One value of the Estonian study is in the methodologic processes brought to bear in addressing possible health effects from the Chernobyl accident. Twenty-five years of research are summarised and opportunities for the future listed.","['Rahu, Kaja', 'Rahu, Mati', 'Tekkel, Mare', 'Veidebaum, Toomas', 'Hakulinen, Timo', 'Auvinen, Anssi', 'Bigbee, William L', 'Hartshorne, Michael F', 'Inskip, Peter D', 'Boice, John D Jr']","['Rahu K', 'Rahu M', 'Tekkel M', 'Veidebaum T', 'Hakulinen T', 'Auvinen A', 'Bigbee WL', 'Hartshorne MF', 'Inskip PD', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, National Institute for Health Development, Tallinn, Estonia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151029,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cohort Studies', '*Decontamination', 'Estonia', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/35/4/R35 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2015 Dec;35(4):R35-45. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/35/4/R35.

Constitutively expressed proteasomes have three active sites, beta1c, beta2c, and beta5c. Lymphoid tissues also express the immunoproteasome subunits beta1i, beta2i, and beta5i. Rapid and simultaneous measurement of the activity of these catalytic subunits would assist in the discovery of new inhibitors, improve analysis of proteasome inhibitors in clinical trials, and simplify analysis of subunit expression. In this work, we present a cocktail of activity-based probes that enables simultaneous gel-based detection of all six catalytic human proteasome subunits. We used this cocktail to develop specific inhibitors for beta1c, beta2c, beta5c, and beta2i, to compare the active-site specificity of clinical proteasome inhibitors, and to demonstrate that many hematologic malignancies predominantly express immunoproteasomes. Furthermore, we show that selective and complete inhibition of beta5i and beta1i is cytotoxic to primary cells from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients.","['de Bruin, Gerjan', 'Xin, Bo Tao', 'Kraus, Marianne', 'van der Stelt, Mario', 'van der Marel, Gijsbert A', 'Kisselev, Alexei F', 'Driessen, Christoph', 'Florea, Bogdan I', 'Overkleeft, Herman S']","['de Bruin G', 'Xin BT', 'Kraus M', 'van der Stelt M', 'van der Marel GA', 'Kisselev AF', 'Driessen C', 'Florea BI', 'Overkleeft HS']","['Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, 9007, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, One Medical Centre Drive, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, 9007, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC, Leiden, The Netherlands. h.s.overkleeft@chem.leidenuniv.nl.', 'Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC, Leiden, The Netherlands. b.florea@chem.leidenuniv.nl.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151029,Germany,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),0370543,"['0 (Molecular Probes)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Catalytic Domain', 'Humans', 'Molecular Probes/*chemistry', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/anie.201509092 [doi]'],ppublish,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2016 Mar 18;55(13):4199-203. doi: 10.1002/anie.201509092.

Because of a lack of robust clinical study evidence, management of CML in children is not standardized and often follows guidelines developed for adults. Children and young adults tend to have a more aggressive clinical presentation than older adults, and prognostic scores for adult CML do not apply to children. CML in children has been considered to have the same biology as in adults, but recent data indicate that some genetic differences exist in pediatric and adult CML. Because children with CML may receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for many decades, and are exposed to TKIs during a period of active growth, morbidities in children with CML may be distinct from those in adults and require careful monitoring. Aggressive strategies, such as eradication of CML stem cells with limited duration and intensive regimens of chemotherapy and TKIs, may be more advantageous in children as a way to avoid lifelong exposure to TKIs and their associated adverse effects. Blood and marrow transplantation in pediatric CML is currently indicated only for recurrent progressive disease, and the acute and long-term toxicities of this option should be carefully evaluated against the complications associated with lifelong use of TKIs.","['Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Millot, Frederic', 'Suttorp, Meinolf']","['Hijiya N', 'Schultz KR', 'Metzler M', 'Millot F', 'Suttorp M']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Ann & Robert H.

Here, we have compared the application of [WR]5 to improve the intracellular uptake of curcumin by using both peptide-curcumin conjugate and physical mixture (peptide + curcumin) strategies. Flow cytometry results showed that the intracellular uptake of curcumin (50 muM) was enhanced through the physical mixing with [WR]5 by 5.7 folds compared to that of curcumin alone in human leukemia (CCRFCEM) cells after 3 h. When [WR]5 was conjugated with curcumin, the intracellular uptake was enhanced by 4 fold. These data suggest that the physical mixture can work more efficiently in enhancing the cellular delivery of curcumin.

Tumor relapse in GBM is inevitable despite maximal therapeutic interventions. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been found to be critical players in therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. Therapeutic drugs targeting GSCs may significantly improve GBM treatment. In this study, we demonstrated that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) effectively disrupted GSCs and inhibited tumor growth in the GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts by targeting the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML). As2O3 treatment induced rapid degradation of PML protein along with severe apoptosis in GSCs. Disruption of the endogenous PML recapitulated the inhibitory effects of As2O3 treatment on GSCs both in vitro and in orthotopic tumors. Importantly, As2O3 treatment dramatically reduced GSC population in the intracranial GBM xenografts and increased the survival of mice bearing the tumors. In addition, As2O3 treatment preferentially inhibited cell growth of GSCs but not matched non-stem tumor cells (NSTCs). Furthermore, As2O3 treatment or PML disruption potently diminished c-Myc protein levels through increased poly-ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of c-Myc. Our study indicated a potential implication of As2O3 in GBM treatment and highlighted the important role of PML/c-Myc axis in the maintenance of GSCs.","['Zhou, Wenchao', 'Cheng, Lin', 'Shi, Yu', 'Ke, Susan Q', 'Huang, Zhi', 'Fang, Xiaoguang', 'Chu, Cheng-wei', 'Xie, Qi', 'Bian, Xiu-wu', 'Rich, Jeremy N', 'Bao, Shideng']","['Zhou W', 'Cheng L', 'Shi Y', 'Ke SQ', 'Huang Z', 'Fang X', 'Chu CW', 'Xie Q', 'Bian XW', 'Rich JN', 'Bao S']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology and Southwest Cancer Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology and Southwest Cancer Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/10/30 06:00,2016/09/08 06:00,['2015/10/30 06:00'],"['2015/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['5836 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5836 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Nov 10;6(35):37300-15. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5836.,"['R01 CA184090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS070315/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA184090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS070315/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4741931,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PML', 'arsenic trioxide', 'c-Myc', 'glioblastoma', 'glioma stem cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although about half of cases are idiopathic, AHA may be associated with several non-neoplastic conditions, autoimmune disorders, as well as haematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoma. The long-term suppression of inhibitors is one of the mainstays of the treatment of AHA. Apart from standard immunosuppressive treatments, rituximab has been proven to be effective in AHA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this review is to provide a systematic description of data available in the literature on this topic. To do so, we performed a search using the indexed online database Medline/PubMed, without temporal limits, matching the words ""rituximab"" and ""acquired h(a)emophilia"". Furthermore, additional published studies were identified in the reference list of the publications found in PubMed. RESULTS: The review of the literature confirms that rituximab may be a safe and useful treatment for AHA. DISCUSSION: Although rituximab is not a standard therapy for AHA, it may be useful in resistant cases. However, the definitive place of this monoclonal antibody in the therapeutic strategy for AHA (first or second-line, alone or in combination with other drugs) remains to be determined more precisely and warrants further investigation.","[""D'arena, Giovanni"", 'Grandone, Elvira', 'Di Minno, Matteo N D', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Di Minno, Giovanni']","[""D'arena G"", 'Grandone E', 'Di Minno MN', 'Musto P', 'Di Minno G']","['Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IRCCS Cancer Referral Centre of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Haemostasis and Thrombosis Unit, IRCCS ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"" Hospital, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Regional Reference Centre for Coagulation Disorders, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Unit of Cell and Molecular Biology in Cardiovascular Diseases.

Two new features were added to a previously developed approach to significantly broaden its scope, versatility, and selectivity. First, the neutral loss of a base (guanine, adenine, thymine, or cytosine) was added to the original methodology's neutral loss of the 2'-deoxyribose moiety to allow for the detection of all DNA base adducts. Second, targeted detection of anticipated DNA adducts based on the reactivity of the DNA alkylating agent was demonstrated by inclusion of an ion mass list for data dependent triggering of MS(2) fragmentation events and subsequent MS(3) fragmentation. Additionally, untargeted screening of the samples, based on triggering of an MS(2) fragmentation event for the most intense ions of the full scan, was included for detecting unknown DNA adducts. The approach was tested by screening for DNA mono and cross-linked adducts in purified DNA and in DNA extracted from cells treated with PR104A, an experimental DNA alkylating nitrogen mustard prodrug currently under investigation for the treatment of leukemia. The results revealed the ability of this new DNA adductomic approach to detect anticipated and unknown PR104A-induced mono and cross-linked DNA adducts in biological samples. This methodology is expected to be a powerful tool for screening for DNA adducts induced by endogenous or exogenous exposures.","['Stornetta, Alessia', 'Villalta, Peter W', 'Hecht, Stephen S', 'Sturla, Shana J', 'Balbo, Silvia']","['Stornetta A', 'Villalta PW', 'Hecht SS', 'Sturla SJ', 'Balbo S']","['Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich , Schmelzbergstrasse 9, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota , 2231 Sixth Street SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota , 2231 Sixth Street SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich , Schmelzbergstrasse 9, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota , 2231 Sixth Street SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151110,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*chemistry', 'Alkylation', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*chemistry', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/07/09 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02759 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2015 Dec 1;87(23):11706-13. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02759.

Indeed, safety of intensive chemotherapy and outcome of obese AML patients in a real-life setting are poorly described, and chemotherapy dosing remains challenging. We included 619 consecutive genetically-defined cases of AML treated with intensive chemotherapy between 2004 and 2012. In this cohort, 93 patients (15%) were classified in the obese category according to WHO classification; 59% of them received capped doses of chemotherapy because of a body surface area above 2 m(2) . Obese patients were older and presented more often with cardiovascular comorbidities. Although obese patients had more frequently de novo AML, main characteristics of AML including white blood cell count, karyotype and mutations were well-balanced between obese and non-obese patients. After induction chemotherapy, early death and complete remission rates were similar. Overall (OS), event-free (EFS) and disease-free (DFS) survival were not significantly different compared to non-obese patients. However, in the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable subgroup, obese patients had lower median OS, EFS and DFS than non-obese patients (18.4, 16.8 and 17.2 vs. 43.6, 31.8 and 29.7 months, respectively) and obesity showed a significant impact on OS (OR 2.54; P = 0.02) in multivariate models. Although we did not find any significant impact of obesity on outcome in the whole series, this study suggests that special efforts for chemotherapy dose optimization are needed in the ELN favorable subgroup since dose capping may be deleterious.","['Tavitian, Suzanne', 'Denis, Amelia', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Berard, Emilie', 'Sarry, Audrey', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Recher, Christian', 'Bertoli, Sarah']","['Tavitian S', 'Denis A', 'Vergez F', 'Berard E', 'Sarry A', 'Huynh A', 'Delabesse E', 'Luquet I', 'Huguet F', 'Recher C', 'Bertoli S']","[""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', 'COREVIH Ile-de-France Centre, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'epidemiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'UMR 1027, INSERM-Universite de Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151126,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Surface Area', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity/*complications/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/06/03 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24228 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 Feb;91(2):193-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24228.

Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are found in 20-30% of patients with CMML. Patients with low risk cytogenetic features (normal karyotype and isolated loss of Y chromosome) account for approximately 80% of CMML patients and often fall into the low risk categories of CMML prognostic scores. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) karyotyping could detect cryptic chromosomal alterations with prognostic impact in these subgroup of patients. SNP-A were performed at diagnosis in 128 CMML patients with low risk karyotypes or uninformative results for conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CC). Copy number alterations (CNAs) and regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) were detected in 67% of patients. Recurrent CNAs included gains in regions 8p12 and 21q22 as well as losses in 10q21.1 and 12p13.2. Interstitial CNN-LOHs were recurrently detected in the following regions: 4q24-4q35, 7q32.1-7q36.3, and 11q13.3-11q25. Statistical analysis showed that some of the alterations detected by SNP-A associated with the patients' outcome. A shortened overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) was observed in cases where the affected size of the genome (considering CNAs and CNN-LOHs) was >11 Mb. In addition, presence of interstitial CNN-LOH was predictive of poor OS. Presence of CNAs (>/=1) associated with poorer OS and PFS in the patients with myeloproliferative CMML. Overall, SNP-A analysis increased the diagnostic yield in patients with low risk cytogenetic features or uninformative CC and added prognostic value to this subset of patients.","['Palomo, Laura', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Mallo, Mar', 'Adema, Vera', 'Cabezon, Marta', 'Arnan, Montse', 'Pomares, Helena', 'Jose Larrayoz, Maria', 'Jose Calasanz, Maria', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Huang, Dayong', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Grau, Javier', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Zamora, Lurdes']","['Palomo L', 'Xicoy B', 'Garcia O', 'Mallo M', 'Adema V', 'Cabezon M', 'Arnan M', 'Pomares H', 'Jose Larrayoz M', 'Jose Calasanz M', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Huang D', 'Shih LY', 'Ogawa S', 'Cervera J', 'Such E', 'Coll R', 'Grau J', 'Sole F', 'Zamora L']","['MDS Research Group, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Departament De Bioquimica I Biologia Molecular, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Duran I Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Duran I Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIMA LAB Diagnostics, Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Navarra, Instituto De Investigacion Sanitaria De Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'CIMA LAB Diagnostics, Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Navarra, Instituto De Investigacion Sanitaria De Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussing Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussing Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Chang Gung University, Taiwan City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO Girona Hospital Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'MDS Research Group, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias I Pujol, Institut De Recerca Contra La Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151209,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', '*Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/06/03 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24227 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 Feb;91(2):185-92. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24227.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the role of the microenvironment on malignant cell behaviour is well described. However, how CLL cells engage and recruit nurturing cells is poorly characterised. Here we demonstrate that CLL cells secrete exosomes that are nanovesicles originating from the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, to shuttle proteins, lipids, microRNAs (miR) and mRNAs to recipient cells. We characterise and confirm the size (50-100 nm) and identity of the CLL-derived exosomes by Electron microscopy (EM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), flow cytometry and western blotting using both exosome- and CLL-specific markers. Incubation of CLL-exosomes, derived either from cell culture supernatants or from patient plasma, with human stromal cells shows that they are readily taken up into endosomes, and induce expression of genes such as c-fos and ATM as well as enhance proliferation of recipient HS-5 cells. Furthermore, we show that CLL exosomes encapsulate abundant small RNAs and are enriched in certain miRs and specifically hsa-miR-202-3p. We suggest that such specific packaging of miR-202-3p into exosomes results in enhanced expression of 'suppressor of fused' (Sufu), a Hedgehog (Hh) signalling intermediate, in the parental CLL cells. Thus, our data show that CLL cells secrete exosomes that alter the transcriptome and behaviour of recipient cells. Such communication with microenvironment is likely to have an important role in CLL disease biology.","['Farahani, Mosavar', 'Rubbi, Carlos', 'Liu, Luning', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh']","['Farahani M', 'Rubbi C', 'Liu L', 'Slupsky JR', 'Kalakonda N']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Functional and Comparative Genomics, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151028,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN202 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUFU protein, human)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Exosomes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', '*Transcriptome', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/06/16 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0141429 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-20708 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Oct 28;10(10):e0141429. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0141429. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4625016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, signaling through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 of the innate immune system has been shown to further contribute to the activation of CLL cells. However, responses to TLR9 engagement are not uniform, but diametrically opposed with cell death in some patients and cell proliferation in others. We now provide evidence that heterogeneous responses to TLR agonists are related to differences in the ability of CLL cells to activate the BCR-associated kinase Syk. Notably, expression of ZAP-70 appears to be of crucial importance for TLR9-mediated activation of Syk. We show that the activation of Syk provides an antiapoptotic signal, which is independent of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, but related to the degradation of the proapoptotic Bim. Mechanistically, TLR9-mediated antiapoptotic signals in ZAP-70-positive CLL trigger secretion of immunoglobulin M, which then serves as (auto-) antigen for a prosurvival BCR signal. Thus, our data show that single activation of the innate immune receptor TLR9 is sufficient to fully engage BCR signaling in ZAP-70-positive CLL, protecting malignant cells from apoptosis. We conclude that the integration of TLR signaling into an adaptive immune response can further promote survival of CLL cells and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of ZAP-70-positive CLL.","['Wagner, Michaela', 'Oelsner, Madlen', 'Moore, Andrew', 'Gotte, Frederik', 'Kuhn, Peer-Hendrik', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Bogner, Christian', 'Baxter, E Joanna', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Follows, George A', 'Ringshausen, Ingo']","['Wagner M', 'Oelsner M', 'Moore A', 'Gotte F', 'Kuhn PH', 'Haferlach T', 'Fiegl M', 'Bogner C', 'Baxter EJ', 'Peschel C', 'Follows GA', 'Ringshausen I']","['3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany;', '3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany;', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', '3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany;', 'Institute for Pathology and Anatomy, Institute for Advanced Study, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany;', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany; and.', '3rd Department of Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany.', '3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany;', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', '3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany;', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', '3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151027,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Adaptive Immunity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*immunology']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/06/15 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30517-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-05-646935 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 28;127(4):436-48. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-05-646935.

Somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene have been detected in enchondroma and hemangioma tissue from patients with Maffucci syndrome. The rate of malignant transformation in Maffucci syndrome is high, with enchondromas transforming into chondrosarcomas and the development of secondary neoplasms, including pancreatic and hepatic adenocarcinoma, mesenchymal ovarian tumors, and brain tumors such as glioma. However, hematopoietic malignancies arising in Maffucci syndrome are rare. We report a 7-year-old girl with Maffucci syndrome in whom acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with cup-like nuclear invagination developed. Both leukemic cells and hemangioma had the same gene mutations: an insertion frameshift c.863_864insTCTG (p.W288 fs) in the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene and a missense mutation c.392_395GTCG > CTCT (p.G131_R132 > AL) in the IDH1 gene. However, buccal mucosa cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after two cycles of chemotherapy showed wild-type genotypes. These results suggest that the multiple somatic mutations of the IDH1 and NPM1 genes in hemangioblasts are related to the development of cup-like AML associated with Maffucci syndrome. However, further studies are needed to identify additional molecular events in AML but not in hemangioma.","['Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Yamaoka, Masayoshi', 'Mikami-Terao, Yoko', 'Ohyama, Wataru', 'Yokoi, Kentaro', 'Arakawa, Yasuhiro', 'Takita, Junko', 'Suzuki, Hideaki', 'Yamada, Hisashi']","['Akiyama M', 'Yamaoka M', 'Mikami-Terao Y', 'Ohyama W', 'Yokoi K', 'Arakawa Y', 'Takita J', 'Suzuki H', 'Yamada H']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan. makiyama@jikei.ac.jp.', 'Research Center for Medical Science, Core Research Facilities for Basic Science, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. makiyama@jikei.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan.', 'Department of Adult Oncology and Hematology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Research Center for Medical Science, Core Research Facilities for Basic Science, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151027,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

We measured endometrial HOXA-10, HOXA-11, LIF, ITGB3, and ITGAV messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions levels before and after myomectomy/metroplasty during mid-luteal phase in participants with IM, submucosal leiomyomas (SM), and septate uterus and fertile participants without fibroids. Initial endometrial sampling was obtained at the time of surgery, and second sampling was obtained 3 months after myomectomy/metroplasty. Expressions of each gene were evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A trend toward decreased endometrial HOXA-10, HOXA-11, and ITGAV mRNA expression was detected in both SM and IM groups before myomectomy when compared to both fertile group and septate uterus. However, the differences failed to show statistical significance. After myomectomy of IM, we have detected 12.8-fold increase in endometrial HOXA-10 mRNA expression and 9.0-fold increase in endometrial HOXA-11 mRNA expression. This increase in endometrial HOXA-10 and 11 mRNA expression was significant. Accordingly, 2 patients having intramural fibroids greater than 5 cm were able to remain pregnant after myomectomy. Conversely, submucosal myomectomy did not cause any significant effect on endometrial receptivity markers. Likewise, all markers of endometrial receptivity remained unchanged after metroplasty. Myomectomy of IM have favorable effect on endometrial HOXA-10 and 11 mRNA expression.","['Unlu, Cihat', 'Celik, Onder', 'Celik, Nilufer', 'Otlu, Baris']","['Unlu C', 'Celik O', 'Celik N', 'Otlu B']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Acibadem University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Usak, Turkey celiksudenaz@gmail.com mcihatunlu@gmail.com.', ""Department of Biochemistry, Behcet Uz Children's Hospital, Izmir, Turkey."", 'Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151027,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (HOXA11 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/surgery', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/genetics/metabolism/surgery', 'Integrin beta3/genetics/metabolism', 'Leiomyoma/*genetics/metabolism/surgery', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Uterine Myomectomy', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/surgery']",2015/10/29 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719115612929 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719115612929 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2016 Jan;23(1):31-41. doi: 10.1177/1933719115612929.

To researchers and clinicians with limited bioinformatics experience, these data have remained available, yet largely inaccessible. Current databases provide information about gene-expression but fail to answer key questions regarding co-regulation, genetic programs or effect on patient survival. To address these shortcomings, we present BloodSpot (www.bloodspot.eu), which includes and greatly extends our previously released database HemaExplorer, a database of gene expression profiles from FACS sorted healthy and malignant haematopoietic cells. A revised interactive interface simultaneously provides a plot of gene expression along with a Kaplan-Meier analysis and a hierarchical tree depicting the relationship between different cell types in the database. The database now includes 23 high-quality curated data sets relevant to normal and malignant blood formation and, in addition, we have assembled and built a unique integrated data set, BloodPool. Bloodpool contains more than 2000 samples assembled from six independent studies on acute myeloid leukemia.

The study investigated pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses of dasatinib in 51 newly diagnosed, chronic phase, chronic myeloid leukemia patients. METHODS: The dasatinib concentration required to inhibit 50 % of the CrkL (CT10 regulator of kinase like) phosphorylation in bone marrow CD34+ cells (half maximal (50 %) inhibitory concentration (IC50)CD34+cells) was calculated from each patient's dose-response curve using flow cytometry. PK parameters were obtained from the population pharmacokinetic analysis of dasatinib concentrations in plasma on day 28 after administration. RESULTS: Early molecular responses were not significantly associated with PK or PD (IC50 CD34+cells) parameters. However, the PK/PD parameter-time above IC50 CD34+cells-significantly correlated with BCR-ABL transcript level at 3 months (correlation coefficient (CC) = -0.292, P = 0.0375) and the reduction of BCR-ABL level at 1 or 3 months (CC = -0.404, P = 0.00328 and CC = -0.356, P = 0.0104, respectively). Patients with more than 12.6 h at time above IC50 CD34+cells achieved a molecular response of 3.0 log reduction at 3 months and those more than 12.8 h achieved a deep molecular response less than 4.0 log reduction at 6 months at a significantly high rate (P = 0.013, odds ratio = 4.8 and P = 0.024, odds ratio = 4.3, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the anti-leukemic activity of dasatinib exhibits in a time-dependent manner and that exposure for more than 12.8 h at time above IC50 CD34+cells could significantly improve prognosis.","['Ishida, Yoji', 'Murai, Kazunori', 'Yamaguchi, Kohei', 'Miyagishima, Takuto', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Ogawa, Kazuei', 'Nagashima, Takahiro', 'Sato, Shinji', 'Watanabe, Reiko', 'Yamamoto, Satoshi', 'Hirose, Takayuki', 'Saitou, Souich', 'Yonezumi, Masakatsu', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Kato, Yuichi', 'Mochizuki, Noboru', 'Ohno, Keiko', 'Kishino, Satoshi', 'Kubo, Kohmei', 'Oyake, Tatsuo', 'Ito, Shigeki']","['Ishida Y', 'Murai K', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Miyagishima T', 'Shindo M', 'Ogawa K', 'Nagashima T', 'Sato S', 'Watanabe R', 'Yamamoto S', 'Hirose T', 'Saitou S', 'Yonezumi M', 'Kondo T', 'Kato Y', 'Mochizuki N', 'Ohno K', 'Kishino S', 'Kubo K', 'Oyake T', 'Ito S']","['Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Morioka, Japan. yishida@iwate-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Internal Medicine, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, 19-1, Uchimaru, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8505, Japan. yishida@iwate-med.ac.jp.', 'Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Morioka, Japan.', 'Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Kushiro Rosai Hospital, Kushiro, Japan.', 'Asahikawa Medical University School of Medicine, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Kitami Red Cross Hospital, Kitami, Japan.', 'Okitama Public General Hospital, Higashi-Okitama, Japan.', 'Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Kawagoe, Japan.', 'Sapporo City General Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Nihonkai General Hospital, Sakata, Japan.', 'Hokkaido Cancer Center, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Japan.', 'Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Japan.', 'Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Japan.', 'Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Morioka, Japan.', 'Iwate Medical University School of Medicine, Morioka, Japan.']",['Inter-Michinoku Dasatinib Study Group (IMIDAS)'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151027,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-crk)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', '*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Dasatinib/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Protein v-crk/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00228-015-1968-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-015-1968-y [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2016 Feb;72(2):185-93. doi: 10.1007/s00228-015-1968-y.

We have previously reported that pyrrocidine A shows potent cytotoxicity against human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, and the activity is 70-fold higher than that of pyrrocidine B which is the analog lacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Pyrrocidine A induced nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and caspase activation in HL60 cells. Since the DNA fragmentation was suppressed by pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), caspase-mediated apoptosis contributes to pyrrocidine A-induced cytotoxicity. JFCR39 human cancer cells panel indicated that the mechanism of action of pyrrocidine A is different from other clinical anticancer drugs, and this compound broadly inhibited the growth of various cancer cell lines. The apoptosis induction by pyrrocidine A was suppressed by both N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione, both of which are thiol-containing antioxidants. Furthermore, pyrrocidine A directly bound to N-acetyl-l-cysteine methyl ester (NACM) through the Michael-type addition at the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group and was detected by HPLC and liquid chromatography-ESI-tandem MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analyses. This indicates that this moiety is crucial for the potent apoptosis-inducing activity of pyrrocidine A.","['Uesugi, Shota', 'Fujisawa, Nozomi', 'Yoshida, Jun', 'Watanabe, Mitsuru', 'Dan, Shingo', 'Yamori, Takao', 'Shiono, Yoshihito', 'Kimura, Ken-ichi']","['Uesugi S', 'Fujisawa N', 'Yoshida J', 'Watanabe M', 'Dan S', 'Yamori T', 'Shiono Y', 'Kimura K']","['The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Center for Liberal Arts and Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Iwate, Japan.', 'National Agricultural Research Center for Tohoku Region (NARCT), Iwate, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Pharmacology, Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Pharmacology, Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Product Evaluation, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Faculty of Agriculture, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan.', 'The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Agriculture, Iwate University, Iwate, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151028,Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartic acid)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (pyrrocidine A)', '0 (pyrrocidine B)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypocreales/chemistry', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2015/10/29 06:00,2016/08/06 06:00,['2015/10/29 06:00'],"['2015/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ja2015103 [pii]', '10.1038/ja.2015.103 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2016 Mar;69(3):133-40. doi: 10.1038/ja.2015.103.

The role of p21(WAF1) in drug-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells was investigated using p53-functional patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), in which p21(WAF1) was epigenetically silenced in T-cell ALL (T-ALL), but not in B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL PDXs. Upon exposure to diverse cytotoxic drugs, T-ALL PDX cells exhibited markedly increased caspase-3/7 activity and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization on the plasma membrane compared with BCP-ALL cells. Despite dramatic differences in apoptotic characteristics between T-ALL and BCP-ALL PDXs, both ALL subtypes exhibited similar cell death kinetics and were equally sensitive to p53-inducing drugs in vitro, although T-ALL PDXs were significantly more sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Transient siRNA suppression of p21(WAF1) in the BCP-ALL 697 cell line resulted in a moderate depletion of the cell fraction in G1 phase and marked increase in PS externalization following exposure to etoposide. Furthermore, stable lentiviral p21(WAF1) silencing in the BCP-ALL Nalm-6 cell line accelerated PS externalization and cell death following exposure to etoposide and vorinostat, supporting previous findings. Finally, the Sp1 inhibitor, terameprocol, inhibited p21(WAF1) expression in Nalm-6 cells exposed to vorinostat and also partially augmented vorinostat-induced cell death. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that p21(WAF1) regulates the early stages of drug-induced apoptosis in ALL cells and significantly modulates their sensitivity to vorinostat.","['Davies, Carwyn', 'Hogarth, Linda A', 'Mackenzie, Karen L', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Davies C', 'Hogarth LA', 'Mackenzie KL', 'Hall AG', 'Lock RB']","[""a Children's Cancer Institute ; Lowy Cancer Research Centre; UNSW Australia ; Sydney , NSW , Australia."", 'c Clinical Pharmacology Modeling and Simulation ; GlaxoSmithKline R&D ; Sydney , Australia.', 'b Northern Institute for Cancer Research ; Newcastle University; Newcastle upon Tyne ; Tyne and Wear , UK.', ""a Children's Cancer Institute ; Lowy Cancer Research Centre; UNSW Australia ; Sydney , NSW , Australia."", 'b Northern Institute for Cancer Research ; Newcastle University; Newcastle upon Tyne ; Tyne and Wear , UK.', ""a Children's Cancer Institute ; Lowy Cancer Research Centre; UNSW Australia ; Sydney , NSW , Australia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53YET703F2 (terameprocol)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Vorinostat']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1100774 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(22):3602-12. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1100774.,,PMC4825786,,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'etoposide', 'p21WAF1', 'patient derived xenograft models', 'terameprocol', 'vorinostat']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used several microarray datasets to test the prognostic efficacy of ATP1B1 expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Within the primary cohort (n = 157), high ATP1B1 expression (ATP1B1(high)) was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) (P = 0.0068, P = 0.0039, respectively). Similar results were also obtained in the European Leukemia Net (ELN) Intermediate-I genetic category (OS: P = 0.0035, EFS: P = 0.0007). Multivariable analyses confirmed ATP1B1(high) is an independent predictor of shorter OS (P = 0.042) and EFS (P = 0.035). Analysis of another CN-AML cohort confirmed that ATP1B1(high) is associated with shorter OS (P = 0.0046, n = 162). In addition, up-regulation of oncogenes/onco-microRNAs such as MYCN, CCND2, CDK6, KIT and miR-155, among others, was associated with ATP1B1(high), which may be indicative of ATP1B1's leukemogenicity.

Here, for the first time we demonstrate that E6-associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase negatively targets MAX binding protein MNT for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation and impedes ATRA mediated myeloid cell differentiation. MNT is a member of the Myc/Max/Mad network of transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Wild-type E6AP promoted proteasome dependent degradation of MNT, while catalytically inactive E6AP having cysteine replaced with alanine at amino-acid 843 position (E6APC843A) rather stabilized it. Further, these proteins physically associated with each other both in non-myeloid (HEK293T) and myeloid cells. MNT overexpression induced G0-G1 growth arrest and promoted myeloid differentiation while its knockdown mitigated even ATRA induced differentiation suggesting MNT to be crucial for myeloid differentiation. We further showed that ATRA inhibited E6AP and stabilized MNT expression by protecting it from E6AP mediated ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Notably, E6AP knockdown in HL60 cells restored MNT expression and promoted myeloid differentiation. Taken together, our data demonstrated that E6AP negatively regulates granulocytic differentiation by targeting MNT for degradation which is required for growth arrest and subsequent myeloid differentiation by various differentiation inducing agents.","['Kapoor, Isha', 'Kanaujiya, Jitendra', 'Kumar, Yogesh', 'Thota, Jagadeshwar Reddy', 'Bhatt, Madan L B', 'Chattopadhyay, Naibedya', 'Sanyal, Sabyasachi', 'Trivedi, Arun Kumar']","['Kapoor I', 'Kanaujiya J', 'Kumar Y', 'Thota JR', 'Bhatt ML', 'Chattopadhyay N', 'Sanyal S', 'Trivedi AK']","['Biochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Biochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Biochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'SAIF Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', ""Department of Radiotherapy, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, UP, India."", 'Division of Endocrinology and Center for Research in Anabolic Skeletal Targets in Health and Illness (ASTHI), CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Biochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Biochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MNT protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (UBE3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/12/22 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['6156 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6156 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 16;7(7):7640-56. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6156.,,PMC4884944,,,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATRA', 'E6AP', 'MNT', 'mass spectrometry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 3,318 patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), 38 patients were diagnosed with pPCL. The median overall survival (OS) of the pPCL patients was 2.85 years, which was significantly extended compared with that in previous reports. The proportion of patients treated with novel agents was 61%. The OS of the patients treated with novel agents was significantly extended compared with that of patients treated without novel agents according to the generalized Wilcoxon test (2.85 vs. 1.16 years, p = 0.049). This statistical finding suggests that treatment with novel agents could have prevented early death in the patients with pPCL. Age was the only statistically significant prognostic factor associated with an inferior OS (hazard ratio 4.57). Five patients received maintenance therapy with novel agents, and their OS tended to be longer than that of the other patients without maintenance (4.45 vs. 2.85 years). Unlike MM, OS for pPCL has not been improved significantly over the last decade, especially in elderly patients. Therefore, it is important to establish the treatment strategy, particularly after induction treatment.","['Iriuchishima, Hirono', 'Ozaki, Shuji', 'Konishi, Jun', 'Matsumoto, Morio', 'Murayama, Kayoko', 'Nakamura, Fumihiko', 'Yamamoto, Go', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Nagura, Eiichi', 'Shimizu, Kazuyuki', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Murakami, Hirokazu']","['Iriuchishima H', 'Ozaki S', 'Konishi J', 'Matsumoto M', 'Murayama K', 'Nakamura F', 'Yamamoto G', 'Handa H', 'Saitoh T', 'Nagura E', 'Shimizu K', 'Nojima Y', 'Murakami H']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20151028,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Societies, Medical', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/02/06 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000439424 [pii]', '10.1159/000439424 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;135(2):113-21. doi: 10.1159/000439424.

The Bcl-2 mRNA re-expression was analyzed by RNA interference using Bcl-2-siRNA. Cellular proliferation was detected using the MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide) assay. The cell apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry. The Bcl-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the drug-resistance group than in the chemotherapy sensitivity group prior to chemotherapy (P < 0.05). In addition, the Bcl-2 mRNA expression in the chemotherapy sensitivity group was significantly higher before chemotherapy than that after chemotherapy (P < 0.05). The Bcl-2 mRNA expression significantly decreased in the leukemic cells of the Bcl-2-siRNA transfection group. We observed statistically significant differences in the relative mRNA expression levels among the Bcl-2-siRNA transfection, blank control, liposome empty transfection, and unrelated sequence oligonucleotide groups (P < 0.05).

The study of miRNAs carried within MVs might provide insights into the roles that miRNAs play in the underlying pathophysiologic processes of acute lymphoblastic leu-kemia (ALL). We identified numerous dysregulated MV miRNAs in patients with B- and T-cell ALL by using Agilent microarray analysis. Selected miRNAs obtained by microarray profiling were validated us-ing quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Us-ing bioinformatic tools, we found that 118 and 116 miRNAs from B- and T-ALL MVs, respectively, regulated the expression of zinc finger protein (ZFP) genes. For example, zinc finger protein 238 (ZNF238), known as a tumor suppressor, was regulated by miR-20b over-expres-sion. Conversely, ZNF267, a cancer-promoting factor, was mediated by downregulated miR-23a and miR-23b. Considering that miRNAs are generally believed to repress gene expression, antineoplastic ZNF238 was likely inhibited while the level of oncogenic ZNF267 was likely increased by miRNA dysregulation, leading to modifica-tion of the ALL microenvironment. In addition, gene ontology and sig-naling pathway analysis demonstrated that a subset of the ZFP genes targeted by altered MV miRNAs are involved in cellular biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. These findings indicated that cancer-associated MV miRNAs and their target ZFP genes might be novel pathogenic factors in ALL. However, the specific roles exerted by MV miRNAs and their target ZFP genes on the pathological mechanisms of ALL remain to be further understood.","['Lu, L', 'Chen, X M', 'Tao, H M', 'Xiong, W', 'Jie, S H', 'Li, H Y']","['Lu L', 'Chen XM', 'Tao HM', 'Xiong W', 'Jie SH', 'Li HY']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151005,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZBTB18 protein, human)', '0 (ZNF267 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr5539 [pii]', '10.4238/2015.October.5.2 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2015 Oct 5;14(4):11884-95. doi: 10.4238/2015.October.5.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actinomycin D (actD) is known to induce nucleolar stress leading to redistribution of many nucleolar proteins, including NPM. We analyzed the distribution of both wild-type and mutated NPM (NPMmut) in human cell lines, before and after low-dose actD treatment, in living cells expressing exogenous fluorescently labeled proteins as well as using immunofluorescence staining of endogenous proteins in fixed cells. The wild-type NPM form is prevalently nucleolar in intact cells and relocalizes mainly to the nucleoplasm following actD addition. The mutated NPM form is found both in the nucleoli and in the cytoplasm of untreated cells. ActD treatment leads to a marked increase in NPMmut amount in the nucleoplasm while a mild decrease is observed in the cytoplasm. Cell death was induced by low-dose actD in all the studied leukemic cell lines with different p53 and NPM status. In cells expressing the tumor suppresor p53 (CML-T1, OCI-AML3), cell cycle arrest in G1/G0 phase was followed by p53-dependent apoptosis while in p53-null HL60 cells, transient G2/M-phase arrest was followed by cell necrosis. We conclude that although actD does not increase NPM concentration in the cytoplasm, it could improve the effect of standard chemotherapy in leukemias through more general mechanisms.","['Brodska, Barbora', 'Holoubek, Ales', 'Otevrelova, Petra', 'Kuzelova, Katerina']","['Brodska B', 'Holoubek A', 'Otevrelova P', 'Kuzelova K']","['Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151109,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25420 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2016 Jun;117(6):1319-29. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25420.

The present study tested the hypothesis that Rap1 is released into the cytoplasm and induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling in macrophages, a cell type involved in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Western blotting analysis confirmed that Rap1 was present in the cytoplasm of differentiated human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1, a macrophage-like cell line). Co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed a direct interaction between Rap1 and I kappa B kinase (IKK). Knockdown of Rap1 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of NFkappaB, and phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IkappaBalpha) and p65 in THP-1 macrophages. The reduction of NFkappaB activity was paralleled by a decreased production of NFkappaB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increased expression of IkappaBalpha (native NFkappaB inhibitor) in various macrophage models with pro-inflammatory phenotype, including THP-1, mouse peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived M1 macrophages. These changes were observed selectively in pro-inflammatory macrophages but not in bone marrow-derived M2 macrophages (with an anti-inflammatory phenotype), mouse lung endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells or human aortic smooth muscle cells. Immunostaining revealed that Rap1 was localized mainly in macrophage-rich areas in human atherosclerotic plaques and that the presence of Rap1 was positively correlated with the advancement of the disease process. In pro-inflammatory macrophages, Rap1 promotes cytokine production via NFkappaB activation favoring a pro-inflammatory environment which may contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis.","['Cai, Yin', 'Sukhova, Galina K', 'Wong, Hoi Kin', 'Xu, Aimin', 'Tergaonkar, Vinay', 'Vanhoutte, Paul M', 'Tang, Eva Hoi Ching']","['Cai Y', 'Sukhova GK', 'Wong HK', 'Xu A', 'Tergaonkar V', 'Vanhoutte PM', 'Tang EH']","['a Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology ; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.', ""b Division of Cardiovascular Medicine; Brigham and Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School ; Boston , MA USA."", 'a Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology ; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology ; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.', 'c Department of Medicine ; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.', 'd Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology ; Biopolis A*STAR, Singapore.', 'a Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology ; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy and State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology ; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.', 'e School of Biomedical Sciences; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; The University of Hong Kong ; Hong Kong , China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TERF2IP protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'I-kappa B Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plaque, Atherosclerotic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Signal Transduction', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1100771 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(22):3580-92. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1100771.,,PMC4825742,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NFkappaB', 'atherosclerosis', 'macrophages', 'pro-inflammatory cytokines', 'repressor activator protein 1', 'signal transduction,', 'telomeric protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 96,721 putative cis-regulatory loci, of which 3,590 were generated de novo, 3,204 had increased H3K4me1, and 5,354 had decreased H3K4me1 in IFNgamma, Il-1beta, and TNFalpha exposed islets. Roughly 10% of the de novo and increased regions were enriched for the repressive histone modification histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in untreated cells, and these were frequently associated with chemokine genes. We show that IFNgamma, Il-1beta, and TNFalpha exposure overcomes this repression and induces chemokine gene activation in as little as three hours, and that this expression persists for days in absence of continued IFNgamma, Il-1beta, and TNFalpha exposure. We implicate trithorax group (TrxG) complexes as likely players in the conversion of these repressed loci to an active state. To block the activity of these complexes, we suppressed Wdr5, a core component of the TrxG complexes, and used the H3K27me3 demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4. We show that GSK-J4 is particularly effective in blunting IFNgamma, Il-1beta, and TNFalpha-induced chemokine gene expression in beta-cells; however, it induced significant islet-cell apoptosis and beta-cell dysfunction. Wdr5 suppression also reduced IFNgamma, Il-1beta, and TNFalpha induced chemokine gene expression in beta-cells without affecting islet-cell survival or beta-cell function after 48hrs, but did begin to increase islet-cell apoptosis and beta-cell dysfunction after four days of treatment. Taken together these data suggest that the TrxG complex is potentially a viable target for preventing cytokine induced chemokine gene expression in beta-cells.","['Tennant, Bryan R', 'Hurley, Peter', 'Dhillon, Jasmine', 'Gill, Amol', 'Whiting, Cheryl', 'Hoffman, Brad G']","['Tennant BR', 'Hurley P', 'Dhillon J', 'Gill A', 'Whiting C', 'Hoffman BG']","[""Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's Hospital and Sunny Hill Health Centre, 950 W28th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's Hospital and Sunny Hill Health Centre, 950 W28th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's Hospital and Sunny Hill Health Centre, 950 W28th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's Hospital and Sunny Hill Health Centre, 950 W28th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's Hospital and Sunny Hill Health Centre, 950 W28th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's Hospital and Sunny Hill Health Centre, 950 W28th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Surgery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151027,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzazepines)', '0 (GSK-J4)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Wdr5 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzazepines/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-1beta/administration & dosage', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Islets of Langerhans/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0141470 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-08704 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Oct 27;10(10):e0141470. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0141470. eCollection 2015.,['MOP-111010/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC4623983,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GEO/GSE73289'],,,,,,

Both agents suppress cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induce apoptosis via cell cycle arrest, but does not obviously modulate autophagy marker, light chain 3 (LC3).

In the absence of a consensus, institutions may use arbitrary methods for evaluating scientists for employment and promotion. There are several indices in use that attempt to establish the most appropriate and suggestive position of any scientist in the field he/she works in. A scientist's Hirsch-index (h-index) quantifies their total effective published output, but h-index summarizes the total value of their published work without regard to their contribution to each publication. Consequently, articles where the author was a primary contributor carry the same weight as articles where the author played a minor role. Thus, we propose an updated h-index named Hirsch(p,t)-index that informs about both total scientific output and output where the author played a primary role. Our measure, h(p,t) = h(p),h(t), is composed of the h-index h(t) and the h-index calculated for articles where the author was a key contributor; i.e. first/shared first or senior or corresponding author. Thus, a h(p,t) = 5,10 would mean that the author has 5 articles as first, shared first, senior or corresponding author with at least 5 citations each, and 10 total articles with at least 10 citations each. This index can be applied in biomedical disciplines and in all areas where the first and last position on an article are the most important. Although other indexes, such as r- and w-indexes, were proposed for measuring the authors output based on the position of researchers within the published articles, our simpler strategy uses the already established algorithms for h-index calculation and may be more practical to implement.","['Bucur, Octavian', 'Almasan, Alex', 'Zubarev, Roman', 'Friedman, Mark', 'Nicolson, Garth L', 'Sumazin,

In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-125b were strongly downregulated in gastric cancer and associated with clinical stage and the presence of lymph node metastases. Additionally, miR-125b could independently predict OS and DFS in gastric cancer. We further found that upregulation of miR-125b inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. miR-125b elicits these responses by directly targeting MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1), which results in a marked reduction in MCL1 expression. Transfection of miR-125b sensitizes gastric cancer cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. By understanding the function and molecular mechanisms of miR-125b in gastric cancer, we may learn that miR-125b has the therapeutic potential to suppress gastric cancer progression and increase drug sensitivity to gastric cancer.","['Wu, Shihua', 'Liu, Feng', 'Xie, Liming', 'Peng, Yaling', 'Lv, Xiaoyuan', 'Zhu, Yaping', 'Zhang, Zhiwei', 'He, Xiusheng']","['Wu S', 'Liu F', 'Xie L', 'Peng Y', 'Lv X', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang Z', 'He X']","['Cancer Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Cancer Cellular and Molecular Pathology of Hunan Provincial University, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, China ; Department of Pathology, Shaoyang Medical College, Shaoyang 422000, China.', 'Graduate Department, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, China.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Cancer Cellular and Molecular Pathology of Hunan Provincial University, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shaoyang Medical College, Shaoyang 422000, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shaoyang Medical College, Shaoyang 422000, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shaoyang Medical College, Shaoyang 422000, China.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Cancer Cellular and Molecular Pathology of Hunan Provincial University, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, China.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Cancer Cellular and Molecular Pathology of Hunan Provincial University, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151004,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/08/18 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/365273 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:365273. doi: 10.1155/2015/365273.

Thus, from September 2013 to December 2014, a large-scale seroprevalence study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence and identify herd-level risk factors associated with MAP and BLV infection. The source sample was 3674 cattle from 113 herds in northern and northeastern China. Antibodies against MAP and BLV were detected using ELISA tests. At animal-level, the seroprevalence of antibodies against MAP and BLV was 11.79% (433/3674) and 18.29% (672/3674), respectively. At herd-level, the seroprevalence of antibodies against MAP and BLV was 20.35% and 21.24% (24/113), respectively. Herd size was identified to be associated with MAP infection while herd size and presence of cattle introduced from other farms were significantly associated with BLV infection. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and improve the knowledge of the epidemiology of these two pathogens in these regions and elsewhere in China.","['Sun, Wu-Wen', 'Lv, Wen-Fa', 'Cong, Wei', 'Meng, Qing-Feng', 'Wang, Chun-Feng', 'Shan, Xiao-Feng', 'Qian, Ai-Dong']","['Sun WW', 'Lv WF', 'Cong W', 'Meng QF', 'Wang CF', 'Shan XF', 'Qian AD']","['College of Animal Science and Technology, Jilin Agriculture University, Changchun, Jilin 130118, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Jilin Agriculture University, Changchun, Jilin 130118, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Jilin Agriculture University, Changchun, Jilin 130118, China.', 'Jilin Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, Changchun, Jilin 130000, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Jilin Agriculture University, Changchun, Jilin 130118, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Jilin Agriculture University, Changchun, Jilin 130118, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Jilin Agriculture University, Changchun, Jilin 130118, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151004,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology/immunology', 'China/epidemiology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis/immunology', 'Paratuberculosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/08/18 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/315173 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:315173. doi: 10.1155/2015/315173.

Lenalidomide is approved for the treatment of patients who have transfusion-dependent anemia due to lower-risk MDS with chromosome 5q deletion (del(5q)) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and isolated del(5q) only in the European Union. Mounting evidence suggests that lenalidomide is effective not only in reducing red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden, but also in modifying the disease natural history by suppressing the malignant clone. Data discussed here from the pivotal phase 2 (MDS-003) and phase 3 (MDS-004) studies of lenalidomide demonstrate that lenalidomide treatment was associated with both short- and long-term benefits. These clinical benefits included high rates of RBC-transfusion independence (TI) with prolonged durations of response, high rates of cytogenetic response (CyR) associated with achievement of durable RBC-TI, no significant difference in rates of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Achievement of RBC-TI and CyR with lenalidomide treatment was associated with extended survival and time to AML progression. Achievement of RBC-TI and hemoglobin response was additionally associated with HRQOL benefits. Recent data describing the impact of TP53 mutations and p53 expression on the prognosis of patients with del(5q) and the impact on response to lenalidomide are also discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of vitamins K3 and K5 on proliferation of human leukemia MOLT-4 cells and on daunorubicin-resistant MOLT-4/DNR cells were estimated by a WST assay. Apoptotic cells were detected by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, followed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Vitamins K3 and K5 significantly inhibited proliferation of leukemic cells at 10 and 100 muM (p<0.05), and these effects were almost equally observed in both MOLT-4 and MOLT/DNR drug-resistant cells. Vitamin K3 induced cell apoptosis at 10 and 100 muM in both MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells (p<0.05). Vitamin K5 also increased apoptotic cells, while rather inducing necrotic cell death. CONCLUSION: Vitamins K3 and K5 suppress MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cell-proliferation partially through induction of apoptosis, and these vitamin derivatives can overcome drug resistance due to P-glycoprotein expression.","['Nakaoka, Eri', 'Tanaka, Sachiko', 'Onda, Kenji', 'Sugiyama, Kentaro', 'Hirano, Toshihiko']","['Nakaoka E', 'Tanaka S', 'Onda K', 'Sugiyama K', 'Hirano T']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Japan hiranot@toyaku.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Vitamins)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'KKP97T7O0X (vitamin k5)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin K 3/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Vitamins/*pharmacology']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['35/11/6041 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 Nov;35(11):6041-8.,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'Vitamin K3', 'apoptosis', 'daunorubicin resistance', 'human T-lymphoblastoid leukemia', 'vitamin K5']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting were applied to demonstrate the induction of apoptosis. Xenografted mice were investigated to show the antitumor effects of 3-indolylmethanamines. (13)C-Nuclear magnetic resource (NMR) and western blotting were used to demonstrate inhibition of glucose metabolism. RESULTS: 31B inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and activated caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), JUN N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38. 31B reduced ovarian cancer xenograft tumor growth and PS121912 inhibited the growth of HL-60-derived xenografts without any sign of toxicity. Compound 31B inhibited de novo glycolysis and lipogenesis mediated by the reduction of fatty acid synthase and lactate dehydrogenase-A expression. CONCLUSION: 3-Indolylmethanamines represent a new class of antitumor agents.

A VH4-34-IgM has recently shown a favorable early response in a phase 1 trial for treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although its B cell ligand has been identified as straight chain poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine (SC-PNAL), the carrier of the sugar moiety has not been identified. Using nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we identify the metabolic activation related protein complex of CD147-CD98 as a major carrier of poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine (SC-PNAL) on human pre-B cell line Nalm-6. Previous studies have suggested CD45 as the SC-PNAL carrier for VH4-34-encoded IgG Abs. Because Nalm-6 is CD45 negative, human peripheral blood B lymphocytes and human B cell line, Reh, with high CD45 expression, were examined for SC-PNAL carrier proteins. Western blot analysis shows that the CD147-98 complex is indeed immunoprecipitated by VH4-34-encoded IgMs from human peripheral blood B lymphocytes and human B cell lines, Reh, OCI-Ly8, and Nalm-6. However, CD45 is immunoprecipitated only from peripheral B lymphocytes, but not from Reh despite the high expression of CD45. These results suggest that human B cells retain SC-PNAL on the CD147-98 complex, but modulate the sugar moiety on CD45. Because the carbohydrate moiety may act as a selecting Ag for VH4-34 autoantibody repertoire, its differential expression on proteins may provide a clue to the intricate atypical regulation of the VH4-34 gene.","['Bhat, Neelima M', 'Adams, Christopher M', 'Chen, Yi', 'Bieber, Marcia M', 'Teng, Nelson N H']","['Bhat NM', 'Adams CM', 'Chen Y', 'Bieber MM', 'Teng NN']","['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; and nbhat@stanford.edu.', 'Stanford University Mass Spectrometry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; and.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; and.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; and.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151026,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (BSG protein, human)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein-1)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)', '82441-98-3 (poly-N-acetyllactosamine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Basigin/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein-1/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1501697 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1501697 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Dec 1;195(11):5178-88. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501697.

This study prompted us to substantiate the finding in a Taiwanese population. Four hundred and four children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 100 adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura or localized lymphoma having normal bone marrow were examined. Two candidate gene approaches, pyrosequencing for NUDT15 and TaqMan assay for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping (rs1142345 A>G), were performed. We showed a risk allele frequency of NUDT15 of 11.6% in children with ALL and 15.5% in adults. By contrast, the risk allele frequency of TPMT was only 1.6% in children with ALL and 0.5% in adults. The high frequency of risk variant for NUDT15, but not the very low frequency of risk variant for TPMT, was closely associated with the intolerance to mercaptopurine in children with ALL in Taiwan, contrast to that of European descent. In regard to NUDT15 polymorphism, the maximal tolerable daily doses of mercaptopurine in homozygotes, heterozygotes and wild-type groups were 9.4 mg m(-2), 30.7 mg m(-2) and 44.1 mg m(-2), respectively.

However, the theoretical survival functions corresponding to the second approach were not clearly defined in the literature, and the use of the 'Simon and Makuch' estimator was criticized in the biostatistical community. Here, we review the 'landmark' approach, showing that it focuses on the average survival of patients conditional on being failure free and on the treatment status assessed at the landmark time. We argue that the 'Simon and Makuch' approach represents counterfactual survival probabilities where treatment status is forced to be fixed: the patient is thought as under chemotherapy without possibility to switch treatment or as under transplant since the beginning of the follow-up. We argue that the 'Simon and Makuch' estimator leads to valid estimates only under the Markov assumption, which is however less likely to occur in practical applications. This motivates the development of a novel approach based on time rescaling, which leads to suitable estimates of the counterfactual probabilities in a semi-Markov process. The method is also extended to deal with a fixed landmark time of interest.","['Bernasconi, Davide Paolo', 'Rebora, Paola', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Antolini, Laura']","['Bernasconi DP', 'Rebora P', 'Iacobelli S', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Antolini L']","['Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Interdipartimentale di Biostatistica a Bioinformatica, Universita Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Chronic Malignancies Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151026,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Biostatistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Markov Chains', '*Models, Statistical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Probability', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/12/28 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.6765 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2016 Mar 30;35(7):1032-48. doi: 10.1002/sim.6765.

Previous work has shown that at least some enhancers form stable protein complexes, leading to the formation of enhanceosomes. We analyzed protein-DNA interactions in the murine beta-globin gene locus using the methyltransferase accessibility protocol for individual templates (MAPit). The data show that a tandem Maf recognition element (MARE) in locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) reveals a remarkably high degree of occupancy during differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells. Most of the other transcription factor binding sites in LCR HS2 or in the adult beta-globin gene promoter regions exhibit low fractional occupancy, suggesting highly dynamic protein-DNA interactions. Targeting of an artificial zinc finger DNA-binding domain (ZF-DBD) to the HS2 tandem MARE caused a reduction in the association of MARE-binding proteins and transcription complexes at LCR HS2 and the adult betamajor-globin gene promoter but did not affect expression of the betaminor-globin gene. The data demonstrate that a stable MARE-associated footprint in LCR HS2 is important for the recruitment of transcription complexes to the adult betamajor-globin gene promoter during erythroid cell differentiation.","['Stees, Jared R', 'Hossain, Mir A', 'Sunose, Tomoki', 'Kudo, Yasushi', 'Pardo, Carolina E', 'Nabilsi, Nancy H', 'Darst, Russell P', 'Poudyal, Rosha', 'Igarashi, Kazuhiko', 'Huang, Suming', 'Kladde, Michael P', 'Bungert, Jorg']","['Stees JR', 'Hossain MA', 'Sunose T', 'Kudo Y', 'Pardo CE', 'Nabilsi NH', 'Darst RP', 'Poudyal R', 'Igarashi K', 'Huang S', 'Kladde MP', 'Bungert J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA sumingh@ufl.edu jbungert@ufl.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Epigenetics, Genetics Institute, UF Health Cancer Center, Powell-Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA sumingh@ufl.edu jbungert@ufl.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151026,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', '*Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Fingers', 'beta-Globins/*genetics']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00723-15 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00723-15 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2015 Oct 26;36(2):238-50. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00723-15.

Key erythroid transcription factors, GATA1 and TAL1, cooperate, along with other proteins, to regulate many aspects of this process. How GATA1 and TAL1 are juxtaposed along the DNA and their cognate DNA binding site across the mouse genome remains unclear. We applied high-resolution ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by 5'-to-3' exonuclease treatment and then massively parallel DNA sequencing) to GATA1 and TAL1 to study their positional organization across the mouse genome during GATA1-dependent maturation. Two complementary methods, MultiGPS and peak pairing, were used to determine high-confidence binding locations by ChIP-exo. We identified approximately 10,000 GATA1 and approximately 15,000 TAL1 locations, which were essentially confirmed by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing). Of these, approximately 4,000 locations were bound by both GATA1 and TAL1. About three-quarters of them were tightly linked to a partial E-box located 7 or 8 bp upstream of a WGATAA motif. Both TAL1 and GATA1 generated distinct characteristic ChIP-exo peaks around WGATAA motifs that reflect their positional arrangement within a complex. We show that TAL1 and GATA1 form a precisely organized complex at a compound motif consisting of a TG 7 or 8 bp upstream of a WGATAA motif across thousands of genomic locations.","['Han, G Celine', 'Vinayachandran, Vinesh', 'Bataille, Alain R', 'Park, Bongsoo', 'Chan-Salis, Ka Yim', 'Keller, Cheryl A', 'Long, Maria', 'Mahony, Shaun', 'Hardison, Ross C', 'Pugh, B Franklin']","['Han GC', 'Vinayachandran V', 'Bataille AR', 'Park B', 'Chan-Salis KY', 'Keller CA', 'Long M', 'Mahony S', 'Hardison RC', 'Pugh BF']","['Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Eukaryotic Gene Regulation, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA bfp2@psu.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151026,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'DNA/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', '*Genomics', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/04/28 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00806-15 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00806-15 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2015 Oct 26;36(1):157-72. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00806-15.

Several studies have shown that further refinement of prognostication for MDS can be achieved by adding flow cytometric parameters. However, widespread implementation of flow cytometry for the prognosis of MDS is hampered by complexity of the analysis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to construct a robust and practical flow cytometric score that could be implemented as a routine procedure. To achieve this, bone marrow aspirates of 109 MDS patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. A second cohort consisting of 103 MDS patients was used to validate the MDS flow cytometric score (MFS). The parameters forming the MFS were sideward light scatter and CD117 expression of myeloid progenitor cells and CD13 expression on monocytes. Three MFS risk categories were formed. Patients with MDS and intermediate MFS scores had significantly better overall survival (OS) compared with the patients with high MFS scores. The MFS further refined prognostication within the IPSS-R low-risk category, by identifying patients with worse OS in case of high MFS. In conclusion, a practical three parameter flow cytometric prognostic score was constructed enabling further refinement of prognostication of MDS.","['Alhan, C', 'Westers, T M', 'Cremers, E M P', 'Cali, C', 'Witte, B I', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'van de Loosdrecht, A A']","['Alhan C', 'Westers TM', 'Cremers EM', 'Cali C', 'Witte BI', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151027,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD13 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015295 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.295 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):658-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.295.

Addressing this knowledge gap may uncover unsuspecting proangiogenic signaling nodes and highlight alternative antiangiogenic therapies. Here, we identify the second messenger cyclic-AMP (cAMP) and the enzyme that terminates its activity, phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), as regulators of B-cell lymphoma angiogenesis. We first show that cAMP, in a PDE4B-dependent manner, suppresses PI3K/AKT signals to downmodulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and vessel formation in vitro. Next, we create a novel mouse model that combines the lymphomagenic Myc transgene with germline deletion of Pde4b. We show that lymphomas developing in a Pde4b-null background display significantly lower microvessel density (MVD) in association with lower VEGF levels and PI3K/AKT activity. We recapitulate these observations by treating lymphoma-bearing mice with the FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitor, Roflumilast. Lastly, we show that primary human DLBCLs with high PDE4B expression display significantly higher MVD. Here, we defined an unsuspected signaling circuitry in which the cAMP generated in lymphoma cells downmodulates PI3K/AKT and VEGF secretion to negatively influence vessel development in the microenvironment. These data identify PDE4 as an actionable antiangiogenic target in DLBCL.","['Suhasini, Avvaru N', 'Wang, Long', 'Holder, Kenneth N', 'Lin, An-Ping', 'Bhatnagar, Harshita', 'Kim, Sang-Woo', 'Moritz, August W', 'Aguiar, Ricardo C T']","['Suhasini AN', 'Wang L', 'Holder KN', 'Lin AP', 'Bhatnagar H', 'Kim SW', 'Moritz AW', 'Aguiar RCT']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio."", 'South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie Murphy VA Hospital, San Antonio.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151027,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclopropanes)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0P6C6ZOP5U (Roflumilast)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE4B protein, human)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/pathology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclopropanes/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2015.302 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):617-626. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.302.

AML is associated with poor patient outcome. PBK/TOPK is a protein kinase derived from PDZ-binding kinase (PBK)/T-lymphokine-activated killer (T-LAK) cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK). Previous studies have shown that PBK/TOPK is expressed in hematologic tumors. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of PBK/TOPK in promyelocyte proliferation and to clarify the molecular mechanism. PBK/TOPK knockdown (KD) significantly decreased cell proliferation and viability in the NB4 and HL-60 promyelocytes. PBK/TOPK KD resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest that attributed to a decrease in cdc2 and cyclin B expression. In addition, PBK/TOPK KD caused apoptosis, as evidenced by activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and an increase in TUNEL-positive cells. PBK/TOPK KD induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation, and inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production suppressed PBK/TOPK KD-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, PBK/TOPK KD decreased Nrf2 expression and ARE-binding activity. Overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the PBK/TOPK KD-induced decrease in cdc2 and cyclin B expression and cell cycle arrest, and blocked ROS production and apoptosis. Based on literature and our results, it was demonstrated that Nrf2 may be a crucial regulator that mediates PBK/TOPK-exerted promotion of cell proliferation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum VEGF levels in 12 CML patients (7 chronic phase, 5 blast crisis phase) were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). VEGF expression was interfered by transfection of K562 cells. VEGF mRNA levels in transfected K562 cells were determined using RT-PCR and the effect of VEGF on the proliferation of transfected K562 cells was investigated. RESULTS: VEGF expression levels were significantly higher in CML patients than normal controls and significantly increased during blast crisis phase than during chronic phase. Compared to controls, the proliferation of the K562 cells was suppressed when VEGF expression was inhibited. However, the inhibited proliferation of K562 cells after gene silencing of VEGF was partially abolished after introducing exogenous VEGF into the cells. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF plays an important role in the initiation and development of CML and monitoring serum VEGF assists guiding the treatment and predicting the prognosis of CML.","['Chen, H', 'Shen, Y-F', 'Gong, F', 'Yang, G-H', 'Jiang, Y-Q', 'Zhang, R']","['Chen H', 'Shen YF', 'Gong F', 'Yang GH', 'Jiang YQ', 'Zhang R']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, China. rizhangdoc@163.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/28 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/10/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2015 Oct;19(19):3569-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four received RTX as a treatment of non Hodking lymphoma, two as a treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one for immune thrombocytopenic purpura and other for microscopic polyangiitis. Six were diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia and one with combined IgM, IgA and IgG2 deficiency. Five presented infections, four of them with good response to intravenous immunoglobulin.

The influence of invasive IA on long-term survival and on transplant-related complications has not been investigated in a larger patient cohort under current conditions. Our aim was to analyze the long-term outcome of patients undergoing allo-HSCT with a history of prior IA. We used European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database data of first allo-HSCTs performed between 2005 and 2010 in patients with acute leukemia. One thousand one hundred and fifty patients with data on IA before allo-HSCT were included in the analysis. The median follow-up time was 52.1 months. We found no significant impact of IA on major transplant outcome variables such as overall survival, relapse-free survival, non-relapse mortality, cumulative incidence of acute GvHD grade II-IV, chronic GvHD, pulmonary complications and leukemia relapse. However, we found a trend toward lower overall survival (P=0.078, hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.16 (0.98, 1.36)) and higher non-relapse mortality (P=0.150, HR (95% CI): 1.19 (0.94, 1.50)) in allo-HSCT recipients with pre-existing IA.

To discover novel inhibitors against drug-resistant CML bearing T315I mutation, we applied a physics-based hierarchical virtual screening approach to dock a large chemical library against ATP binding pockets of both wild-type (WT) and T315I mutant ABL kinases in a combinatorial fashion. This strategy automatically resulted in 87 compounds satisfying structural and energetic criteria of both WT and T315I mutant kinases. Among them, nine compounds, which share a common thiophene-based scaffold and adopt similar binding poses, were chosen for experimental testing and one of them was shown to have low micromolar inhibition activities against both WT and mutant ABL kinases. Structure-activity relationship analysis with a series of structural modifications based on 2-acylaminothiophene-3-carboxamide scaffold supports our predicted binding mode. Interestingly, the same chemical scaffold was also enriched in our previous virtual screening campaign against colchicine site of microtubules using the same computational protocol, which suggests our virtual screening strategy is capable of discovering small-molecule ligands targeting distinct protein binding sites without sharing any sequential and structural similarity. Furthermore, the multitarget inhibition activity of this class of compounds was assessed in cellular experiments. We expect that the 2-acylaminothiophene-3-carboxamide scaffold may serve as a promising starting point for developing multitarget inhibitors in cancer treatment by targeting both kinases and microtubules.","['Cao, Ran', 'Wang, Yanli', 'Huang, Niu']","['Cao R', 'Wang Y', 'Huang N']","['National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing , No. 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, 102206, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing , No. 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, 102206, China.', 'National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing , No. 7 Science Park Road, Zhongguancun Life Science Park, Beijing, 102206, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151104,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiophenes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/09/24 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00540 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2015 Nov 23;55(11):2435-42. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00540.

METHODS: We assessed methylation of the CpG island on the p15 gene in bone marrow mononuclear cells in 93 ALL cases and in a control group of 20 children with idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) by restriction enzyme Eco52I digestion combined with polymerase chain reaction techniques. We explored the effect of varying levels of methylation on event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: The mean methylation level was 25 % in de novo ALL and significantly higher than the control group 2 %, P < 0.01). Forty-two percent of cases (39/93) had hypermethylation (level over 10 %). Fifty-seven percent (12/21) and 38 % (27/72) T- and precursor-B ALL patients had hypermethylation (not significant). For all patients, the 8-year EFS was (83 +/- 4) %, standard risk (91 +/- 4) %, intermediate risk (IR) (82 +/- 5) %, and high risk (HR) (43 +/- 19) % (chi(2) = 11.58, P < 0.01). Hypermethylation was associated with a lower 8-year EFS (71 +/- 7 vs. 91 +/- 4 %, P = 0.02) in univariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL have higher levels of p15 CpG island methylation than a control group of children with ITP. Among children with ALL, hypermethylation was associated with inferior EFS. Higher levels of p15 CpG island methylation may be a poor prognostic marker in childhood ALL.","['Mai, Huirong', 'Liu, Xiaolan', 'Chen, Yixin', 'Li, Changgang', 'Cao, Lizhi', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Chen, Senmin', 'Liu, Guosheng', 'Wen, Feiqiu']","['Mai H', 'Liu X', 'Chen Y', 'Li C', 'Cao L', 'Chen X', 'Chen S', 'Liu G', 'Wen F']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-015-2063-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-2063-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Feb;142(2):497-504. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-2063-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate relationship between demographics and dental status in a defined group of Iranian paediatric patients undergoing cancer therapy. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was accomplished on 161 subjects age ranging 8-12 years. There were 76 cancerous patients hospitalized at Mahak Hospital (one of the major children's cancer centers in Tehran) as the study group and 85 healthy children attending at Dental School, International Branch of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran from 2012 to 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographics were gathered by using data-form. Oral examination and DMFT Index were used to describe teeth status in all teeth and in the first permanent molars. According to Becker's definition, ""D"" stands for untreated decayed teeth, ""M"" indicates missing teeth, and ""F"" shows Filled teeth. It is noteworthy that full coverage crowns are considered as ""F"" in this Index. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Student's t-tests and Logistic Regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The most frequent type of cancer was acute lymphoblastic/lymphocytic leukemia (33.3%). Patients were significantly shorter than controls (p=0.03), and their fathers and mothers were of lower educational achievement (p=0.01, p= 0.001). Although DMFT of all dentition showed significantly higher score in cancerous children (p=0.001), DMFT of four first permanent molars (left, right, upper, and lower) was borderline significantly higher in patients (p= 0.06). Moreover, frequency of cancer was borderline significantly higher in children with lower birth order (p= 0.05). According to Logistic Regression, in as much as patients grew elder 1 year, DMFT index increased 1.5 units. CONCLUSION: Patients under cancer therapy were shorter than healthy ones, and their parents were of lower educational levels. In addition, their teeth status was poorer than controls.","['Mortazavi, Hamed', 'Tashvighi, Maryam', 'Azizian, Morteza', 'Khalighi, Hamid Reza', 'Sabour, Siamak', 'Movahhedian, Amir', 'Baharvand, Maryam']","['Mortazavi H', 'Tashvighi M', 'Azizian M', 'Khalighi HR', 'Sabour S', 'Movahhedian A', 'Baharvand M']","['Associate Professor, Department of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical School.

We have recently reported that N-CoR actively represses Flt3, a key factor of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) self-renewal and growth, and that de-repression of Flt3 by the misfolded N-CoR plays an important role in the pathogenesis of promyelocytic and monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The leukemic cells derived from the promyelocytic and monocytic AML are distinctly characterized by the ectopic reactivation of stem cell phenotypes in relatively committed myeloid compartment. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not known. Here, we report that N-CoR function is essential for the commitment of primitive hematopoietic cells to the cells of myeloid lineage and that loss of N-CoR function due to misfolding is linked to the ectopic reactivation of generic stem cell phenotypes in promyelocytic and monocytic AML. Analysis of N-CoR and Flt3 transcripts in mouse hematopoietic cells revealed a positive correlation between N-CoR level and the commitment of myeloid cells and an inverse correlation between N-CoR and Flt3 levels in primitive as well as committed myeloid cells. Enforced N-CoR expression in mouse HSCs inhibited their growth and self-renewal potentials and promoted maturation toward cells of myeloid lineage, suggesting a role of N-CoR in the commitment of cells of myeloid lineage. In contrast to AML cells with natively folded N-CoR, primary and secondary promyelocytic and monocytic AML cells harboring the misfolded N-CoR were highly positive for Flt3 and myeloid antigen-based HSC marker CD34. Genetic and therapeutic restoration of N-CoR conformation significantly down-regulated the CD34 levels in monocytic AML cells, suggesting an important role of N-CoR in the suppression of CD34-based HSC phenotypes. These findings collectively suggest that N-CoR is crucial for the commitment of primitive hematopoietic cells to cells of myeloid lineage and that misfolded N-CoR may contribute to transformation of committed myeloid cells through the ectopic reactivation of Flt3/CD34-based stem cell phenotypes in promyelocytic and monocytic AML. Moreover, these findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the formation of leukemic stem cells in subsets of AML and identify the misfolded N-CoR as a subtype-specific biomarker of AML.","['Nin, Dawn Sijin', 'Li, Feng', 'Visvanathan, Sridevi', 'Khan, Matiullah']","['Nin DS', 'Li F', 'Visvanathan S', 'Khan M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore , Singapore , Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore , Singapore , Singapore.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, AIMST University , Semeling , Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, AIMST University , Semeling , Malaysia.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151007,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2015/10/27 06:00,2015/10/27 06:01,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00210 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Oct 7;5:210. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00210. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4595783,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD34', 'Flt3', 'LSCs', 'NCoR', 'misfolded protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of compounds targeting multiple PI3K isoforms (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma) in CLL cells, in vitro, resulted in sustained inhibition of BCR signalling but with enhanced cytotoxicity and the potential for improve clinical responses.

METHODS: A total of 71 Chinese adult de novo AML cases were evaluated for cNPM1 by IHC where the bone marrow trephines were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and decalcified by 5% EDTA. NPM1 and FLT3-ITD gene mutations were also investigated using PCR, fragment analysis and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: IHC analysis of cNPM1 had a very good sensitivity (86.7%) and excellent specificity (96.4%) for NPM1 mutation. The positive predictive value was 86.7% and the negative predictive value was 96.4%. NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD were closely associated (p = 0.003). Patients with mutated NPM1 and without FLT3-ITD mutation have a longer overall survival (p = 0.042) than patients with both NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that IHC detection of cNPM1 in formalin-fixed trephine biopsies correlated well but not entirely with NPM1 mutation. Furthermore, NPM1 mutations were significantly more frequent in FLT3-ITD than FLT3-wild-type cases.","['Lit, Benny Man Wai', 'Kwong, Yok Lam', 'Wong, Kit Fai']","['Lit BM', 'Kwong YL', 'Wong KF']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151023,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jclinpath-2015-203175 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2015-203175 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2016 May;69(5):409-14. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2015-203175.

Like other Pim kinases, Pim2 is constitutively active and is believed to be essentially regulated through its accumulation. We show that in leukaemic cells, the three Pim2 isoforms have dramatically short half-lives although the longer isoform is significantly more stable than the shorter isoforms. All isoforms present a cytoplasmic localization and their degradation was neither modified by broad-spectrum kinase or phosphatase inhibitors such as staurosporine or okadaic acid nor by specific inhibition of several intracellular signalling pathways including Erk, Akt and mTORC1. Pim2 degradation was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors but Pim2 ubiquitination was not detected even by blocking both proteasome activity and protein de-ubiquitinases (DUBs). Moreover, Pyr41, an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) inhibitor, did not stabilize Pim2, strongly suggesting that Pim2 was degraded by the proteasome without ubiquitination. In agreement, we observed that purified 20S proteasome particles could degrade Pim2 molecule in vitro. Pim2 mRNA accumulation in UT7 cells was controlled by erythropoietin (Epo) through STAT5 transcription factors. In contrast, the translation of Pim2 mRNA was not regulated by mTORC1. Overall, our results suggest that Pim2 is only controlled by its mRNA accumulation level. Catalytically active Pim2 accumulated in proteasome inhibitor-treated myeloma cells. We show that Pim2 inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, have additive effects to inhibit the growth of myeloma cells, suggesting that Pim2 could be an interesting target for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Adam, Kevin', 'Lambert, Mireille', 'Lestang, Elsa', 'Champenois, Gabriel', 'Dusanter-Fourt, Isabelle', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Zermati, Yael', 'Mayeux, Patrick']","['Adam K', 'Lambert M', 'Lestang E', 'Champenois G', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Tamburini J', 'Bouscary D', 'Lacombe C', 'Zermati Y', 'Mayeux P']","['Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France Hopital Cochin, AP-HP, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France Hopital Cochin, AP-HP, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France.', 'Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, Paris 75014, France Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee, Paris 75014, France patrick.mayeux@inserm.fr.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151023,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BSR20150217 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20150217 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2015 Oct 23;35(6). pii: BSR20150217. doi: 10.1042/BSR20150217.,,PMC4672348,,['(c) 2015 Authors.'],['NOTNLM'],"['leukaemia', 'multiple myeloma', 'proteasome', 'protein degradation', 'ubiquitin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show for the first time that freshly isolated non-cultured human cord blood (CB)- and peripheral blood (PB)-derived CD19+CD20+ B cells can be reprogrammed to iPSCs carrying complete VDJH immunoglobulin (Ig) gene monoclonal rearrangements using non-integrative tetracistronic, but not monocistronic, OSKM-expressing Sendai Virus. Co-expression of C/EBPalpha with OSKM facilitates iPSC generation from both CB- and PB-derived B cells. We also demonstrate that myeloid cells are much easier to reprogram than B and T lymphocytes. Differentiation potential back into the cell type of their origin of B-cell-, T-cell-, myeloid- and fibroblast-iPSCs is not skewed, suggesting that their differentiation does not seem influenced by 'epigenetic memory'. Our data reflect the actual cell-autonomous reprogramming capacity of human primary B cells because biased reprogramming was avoided by using freshly isolated primary cells, not exposed to cytokine cocktails favoring proliferation, differentiation or survival. The ability to reprogram CB/PB-derived primary human B cells offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying developmental B lymphopoiesis and modeling B-cell malignancies.","['Bueno, C', 'Sardina, J

Here microarray analysis of FOXP1-silenced DLBCL cell lines identified differential regulation of immune response signatures and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes as some of the most significant differences between germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like DLBCL with full-length FOXP1 protein expression versus activated B-cell (ABC)-like DLBCL expressing predominantly short FOXP1 isoforms. In an independent primary DLBCL microarray data set, multiple MHC II genes, including human leukocyte antigen DR alpha chain (HLA-DRA), were inversely correlated with FOXP1 transcript expression (P<0.05). FOXP1 knockdown in ABC-DLBCL cells led to increased cell-surface expression of HLA-DRA and CD74. In R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)-treated DLBCL patients (n=150), reduced HLA-DRA (<90% frequency) expression correlated with inferior overall survival (P=0.0003) and progression-free survival (P=0.0012) and with non-GCB subtype stratified by the Hans, Choi or Visco-Young algorithms (all P<0.01). In non-GCB DLBCL cases with <90% HLA-DRA, there was an inverse correlation with the frequency (P=0.0456) and intensity (P=0.0349) of FOXP1 expression.

Several observations suggest an additive effect of ESA and LEN in this situation. We performed a randomized phase III study in 131 RBC transfusion-dependent (TD, median transfusion requirement six RBC units per 8 weeks) lower-risk ESA-refractory non-del5q MDS. Patients received LEN alone, 10 mg per day, 21 days per 4 weeks (L arm) or LEN (same schedule) + erythropoietin (EPO) beta, 60,000 U per week (LE arm). In an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, erythroid response (HI-E, IWG 2006 criteria) after four treatment cycles (primary end point) was 23.1% (95% CI 13.5-35.2) in the L arm and 39.4% (95% CI 27.6-52.2) in the LE arm (P=0.044), while RBC-TI was reached in 13.8 and 24.2% of the patients in the L and LE arms, respectively (P=0.13). Median response duration was 18.1 and 15.1 months in the L and LE arms, respectively (P=0.47). Side effects were moderate and similar in the two arms. Low baseline serum EPO level and a G polymorphism of CRBN gene predicted HI-E. Combining LEN and EPO significantly improves erythroid response over LEN alone in lower-risk non-del5q MDS patients with anemia resistant to ESA.","['Toma, A', 'Kosmider, O', 'Chevret, S', 'Delaunay,

Thrombocytopenia is an independent factor for decreased survival and has been incorporated in newer prognostic scoring systems. The mechanisms of thrombocytopenia are multifactorial and involve a differentiation block of megakaryocytic progenitor cells, leading to dysplastic, hypolobated and microscopic appearing megakaryocytes or increased apoptosis of megakaryocytes and their precursors. Dysregulated thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling and increased platelet destruction through immune or nonimmune mechanisms are frequently observed in MDS. The clinical management of patients with low platelet counts remains challenging and approved chemotherapeutic agents such as lenalidomide and azacytidine can also lead to a transient worsening of thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion is the only supportive treatment option currently available for clinically significant thrombocytopenia. The TPO receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag have shown clinical activity in clinical trials in MDS. In addition to thrombopoietic effects, eltrombopag can inhibit leukemic cell proliferation via TPO receptor-independent effects. Other approaches such as treatment with cytokines, immunomodulating drugs and signal transduction inhibitors have shown limited activity in selected groups of MDS patients. Combination trials of approved agents with TPO agonists are ongoing and hold promise for this important clinical problem.","['Li, W', 'Morrone, K', 'Kambhampati, S', 'Will, B', 'Steidl, U', 'Verma, A']","['Li W', 'Morrone K', 'Kambhampati S', 'Will B', 'Steidl U', 'Verma A']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Jacobi Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151026,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'GN5XU2DXKV (romiplostim)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hemorrhage/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/therapeutic use', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Fc/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015297 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.297 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):536-44. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.297.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients experienced disease progression from chronic or accelerated phase, and 7 cases presented as CML-BP. Thirteen patients (25.5%) had extramedullary involvement at diagnosis, and 71% were myeloid BP. Clonal evolution was identified in 53% of the cases, and the abnormalities most frequently observed were isochromosome (17q), double Philadelphia chromosome, and trisomy 8. Forty-five patients received treatment: 60% chemotherapy (CT) alone and 40% CT plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or TKI alone; 42% of them experienced CHR. RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) in patients whose disease responded to treatment was 7 months (95% confidence interval, 1.7-6.2 months), with a median disease-free survival of 5 months (95% confidence interval, 2.8-5.8 months). One out of 3 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation remains alive. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphoid BP and TKI therapy had a statistically significant positive impact as prognostic factors for CHR. In the multivariate analysis, age > 60 years, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, and complex karyotype were statistically significant negative prognostic factors for OS. There was no statistical significant difference in OS between patients who received only CT (1988-2002) with those treated with CT plus TKI (2003-2013). CONCLUSION: This is the first study in Mexico to report prognostic factors associated with CHR and OS in patients with CML-BP.","['Perez-Jacobo, Fernando', 'Tuna-Aguilar, Elena', 'Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta', 'Crespo-Solis, Erick', 'Valencia-Rocha, Ubaldo', 'Aguayo, Alvaro', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier']","['Perez-Jacobo F', 'Tuna-Aguilar E', 'Demichelis-Gomez R', 'Crespo-Solis E', 'Valencia-Rocha U', 'Aguayo A', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X']","['Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Chronic Leukemia Clinic, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.

We evaluated the efficacy of LD-ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with APL during the period of 2002 to 2014 were included. They received ATRA 25 mg/m(2) plus anthracycline (doxorubicin or mitoxantrone) as induction chemotherapy, followed by 3 consolidations with LD-ATRA and anthracycline and maintenance therapy with intermittent LD-ATRA and oral chemotherapy for 2 years. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with a median age of 28 years (range, 18-55 years) were included; 17 (77%) were in the low-risk group. Complete remission occurred in 86%, and the early death rate was 9%. At a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 4-126 months) disease-free survival (DFS) was 75% and overall survival (OS) was 86%, with a relapse rate of 27% for the entire follow-up period. CONCLUSION: LD-ATRA plus anthracycline is safe and effective in achieving CR of APL. The early death rate is similar to that of treatment with standard doses, but it appears to be inferior in preventing relapses.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Gonzalez-Leal, Xitlaly Judith', 'Pinzon-Uresti, Monica Andrea', 'Gomez-De Leon, Andres', 'Cantu-Rodriguez, Olga G', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Homero', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Gonzalez-Leal XJ', 'Pinzon-Uresti MA', 'Gomez-De Leon A', 'Cantu-Rodriguez OG', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre H', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Hematology Department, Internal Medicine Division, ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"" University Hospital of the School of Medicine of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.

To identify gene alterations that cooperate with STAT5 activation to initiate leukemia, we crossed mice expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5 (Stat5b-CA) with mice in which a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon (T2/Onc) was mobilized only in B cells. Stat5b-CA mice typically do not develop B-ALL (<2% penetrance); in contrast, 89% of Stat5b-CA mice in which the T2/Onc transposon had been mobilized died of B-ALL by 3 months of age. High-throughput sequencing approaches were used to identify genes frequently targeted by the T2/Onc transposon; these included Sos1 (74%), Kdm2a (35%), Jak1 (26%), Bmi1 (19%), Prdm14 or Ncoa2 (13%), Cdkn2a (10%), Ikzf1 (8%), Caap1 (6%) and Klf3 (6%). Collectively, these mutations target three major cellular processes: (i) the Janus kinase/STAT5 pathway (ii) progenitor B-cell differentiation and (iii) the CDKN2A tumor-suppressor pathway. Transposon insertions typically resulted in altered expression of these genes, as well as downstream pathways including STAT5, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and p38. Importantly, expression of Sos1 and Kdm2a, and activation of p38, correlated with survival, further underscoring the role these genes and associated pathways have in B-ALL.","['Heltemes-Harris, L M', 'Larson, J D', 'Starr, T K', 'Hubbard, G K', 'Sarver, A L', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Farrar, M A']","['Heltemes-Harris LM', 'Larson JD', 'Starr TK', 'Hubbard GK', 'Sarver AL', 'Largaespada DA', 'Farrar MA']","['Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", 'Center for Genome Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for Genome Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151026,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SOS1 Protein)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (FBXL11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SOS1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2015/10/27 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2015405 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.405 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Jun 30;35(26):3454-64. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.405.

The poor prognosis in adult ALL has in part been attributed to larger proportion of high-risk leukemia showing drug resistance. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets in ALL is needed for further improvements in treatment outcomes of adult ALL. Genetic aberration of chromatin-modifying molecules has been recently reported in subtypes of ALL, and targeting components of chromatin complexes has shown promising efficacy in preclinical studies. Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 2 (SUV39H2), also known as KMT1B, is a SET-domain-containing histone methyltransferase that is upregulated in solid cancers, but its expression is hardly detectable in normal tissues. Here, we show that SUV39H2 is highly expressed in ALL cells but not in blood cells from healthy donors and also that SUV39H2 mRNA is expressed at significantly higher levels in bone marrow or blood cells from patients with ALL obtained at diagnosis compared with those obtained at remission (P = .007). In four ALL cell lines (Jurkat and CEM derived from T-ALL and RS4;11 and REH derived from B-ALL), SUV39H2 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability (~77%, P < .001), likely through induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, SUV39H2 overexpression made cells more resistant to chemotherapy. We conclude that SUV39H2 is a promising therapeutic target and further investigation of this therapeutic approach in ALL is warranted.","['Mutonga, Martin', 'Tamura, Kenji', 'Malnassy, Gregory', 'Fulton, Noreen', 'de Albuquerque, Amanda', 'Hamamoto, Ryuji', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Alachkar, Houda']","['Mutonga M', 'Tamura K', 'Malnassy G', 'Fulton N', 'de Albuquerque A', 'Hamamoto R', 'Stock W', 'Nakamura Y', 'Alachkar H']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Biosciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.

PrAgU2/LF was cytotoxic to five out of nine AML cell lines. Cytotoxicity of PrAgU2/LF appeared to be nonapoptotic and was associated with MAPK activation and urokinase activity because all the PrAgU2/LF-sensitive cell lines showed both uPAR expression and high levels of MEK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of uPAR or desensitization of cells to MEK1/2 inhibition blocked toxicity of PrAgU2/LF, indicating requirement for both uPAR expression and MAPK activation for activity. PrAgU2/LF was also cytotoxic to primary blasts from AML patients, with blasts from four out of five patients showing a cytotoxic response to PrAgU2/LF. Cytotoxicity of primary AML blasts was also dependent on uPAR expression and phos-MEK1/2 levels. CD34(+) bone marrow blasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells lacked uPAR expression and were resistant to PrAgU2/LF, demonstrating the lack of toxicity to normal hematological cells and, therefore, the tumor selectivity of this approach. Dose escalation in mice revealed that the maximal tolerated dose of PrAgU2/LF is at least 5.7-fold higher than that of the wild-type anthrax lethal toxin, PrAg/LF, further demonstrating the increased safety of this molecule. We have shown, in this study, that PrAgU2/LF is a novel, dual-specific molecule for the selective targeting of AML.","['Bekdash, Amira', 'Darwish, Manal', 'Timsah, Zahra', 'Kassab, Elias', 'Ghanem, Hadi', 'Najjar, Vicky', 'Ghosn, Marwan', 'Nasser, Selim', 'El-Hajj, Hiba', 'Bazerbachi, Ali', 'Liu, Shihui', 'Leppla, Stephen H', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Abi-Habib, Ralph J']","['Bekdash A', 'Darwish M', 'Timsah Z', 'Kassab E', 'Ghanem H', 'Najjar V', 'Ghosn M', 'Nasser S', 'El-Hajj H', 'Bazerbachi A', 'Liu S', 'Leppla SH', 'Frankel AE', 'Abi-Habib RJ']","['Department of Natural Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102 2801, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102 2801, Lebanon.', 'School of Molecular & Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102 2801, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102-2801, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102-2801, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102-2801, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102-2801, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Experimental Pathology, School of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, School of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, School of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Microbial Pathogenesis Section, Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.', 'Microbial Pathogenesis Section, Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.', 'Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut 1102 2801, Lebanon.

Furthermore, cell viability and apoptosis were examined in HL60 cells transfected with miR519 mimics, miR519 inhibitors or a negative control. In addition, the effects of human antigen R (HuR) on cell apoptosis were investigated using specific small interfering RNA targeting HuR. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of miR519 were significantly increased in the AML cells and the tissue samples, suggesting that miR519 may contribute to abnormal HL60 cell proliferation. Upregulation of miR519 expression decreased HL60 cell viability and induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of HuR reduced cell migration and enhanced cell apoptosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2009, six cases of CLL associated with solid tumor were diagnosed in Hematology Department of Military Hospital of Tunis. The diagnosis of CLL was made by immunophenotyping of peripheral blood circulating B cells, and the diagnosis of solid tumors was made by biopsy with anatomopathological exam and immunohistochemical study. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 71 years. Five patients were male. The CLL was classified Stage A in one case, Stage B in three cases and Stage C in two cases. Two patients had abnormal karyotype. Three patients have not received specific treatment for their CLL. Solid tumors were represented by skin cancer in three cases, lung cancer in two cases and breast cancer in one case. The median time between diagnosis of CLL and that of solid tumor was 53 months. CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL have an increased risk of developing a second cancer.

We assessed the potential association of selected WT1 SNPs as well as WT1 mutations in normal karyotype (NK)-AML and evaluated the prognostic value of these normal gene variants. Diagnostic samples from a series of 474 young adult NK-AML patients were used to genotype five WT1 SNPs using TaqMan assays and to directly sequence WT1 exons 7 and 9. Analysis of five WT1 gene variants showed an association of rs2234593 allele C with WT1 Ex7 mutation. Prognostic study of the same variants identified rs2234593 significantly associated with relapse and overall survival (OS). Patients with rs2234593AA/AC showed significantly higher 10-year OS (50 vs 36 %, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69 (0.52-0.90), p = 0.006) and lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (36 vs 51 %, HR = 0.62 (0.45-0.86), p = 0.004) compared to those with rs2234593CC. The effect of AA genotype on CIR remained significant after adjustment for basic covariates including FLT3 internal-tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations (HR = 0.60 (0.41-0.89), p = 0.009), with some evidence of improved survival (HR = 0.75 (0.55-1.03), p = 0.07). A multivariate analysis showed WT1 Ex7-mutant as the major relapse predictor, with a tendency for rs2234593-A effect after allowing for Ex7 mutation (p = 0.07). No adjusted risk benefit was found for previously reported rs16754-G. In conclusion, WT1 normal gene variant rs2234593 is associated with mutational status of WT1 Ex7 and is a further prognostic marker independent from FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in NK-AML.","['Niavarani, Ahmadreza', 'Horswell, Stuart', 'Sadri, Ramin', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Niavarani A', 'Horswell S', 'Sadri R', 'Bonnet D']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/05/21 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-015-2534-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-015-2534-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Jan;95(2):179-90. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2534-5.,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data of 90, 5371, and 3301 patients with BAL, AML, and ALL, respectively, were included in the analysis. The median follow-up period was 1481.5 days (range: 0-5556). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the BAL, AML, and ALL patients were 39.6, 41.8, and 42.0 %, respectively (BAL vs. AML, P = 0.98 BAL vs. ALL, P = 0.77). A multivariate analysis revealed that, in comparison to BAL, AML with a better-risk karyotype was associated with superior OS. An analysis of the prognostic factors of BAL patients showed that OS was significantly longer in patients who were in their first complete remission in comparison to patients who were not in remission. Our data suggest that HSCT is an effective treatment for BAL patients, regardless of the presence of any known poor prognostic factors other than a non-remission status.","['Mori, Jinichi', 'Ishiyama, Ken', 'Yamaguchi, Takuhiro', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Kobayashi, Takeshi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Hirokawa, Makoto', 'Mori, Shinichiro', 'Nagamura, Tokiko', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Takami, Akiyoshi']","['Mori J', 'Ishiyama K', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Tanaka J', 'Uchida N', 'Kobayashi T', 'Fukuda T', 'Kanamori H', 'Miyamura K', 'Takahashi S', 'Eto T', 'Hirokawa M', 'Mori S', 'Nagamura T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Takami A']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Transplantation, Homologous/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/05/21 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-015-2536-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-015-2536-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Jan;95(2):295-300. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2536-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Study subjects were the 111 cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed from 1998 to 2011 among residents of two provinces of the northern Italian Emilia-Romagna region, and 444 controls matched by age and sex. Through mapping of the region carried out by remote sensing, we examined the percentage of urban or rural area in the 100-meter circular buffer around each child's house. We also modeled annual average exposure to benzene and PM10 from vehicular traffic at each residence. RESULTS: In a multivariate model adjusting for benzene and PM10, the odds ratio of leukemia associated with residence in a highly urbanized area and residential area (>/=95% land use of this type near the child's home) was 1.4 (95% confidence intervals 0.8-2.4) and 1.3 (0.8-2.2), respectively. An increased risk was also found in association with the proximity to <<dumps, scrap yards, and building sites>>. No association emerged with residence in rural areas or near industrial plants. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that children living in urban areas experience an excess leukemia risk, independently from exposure to pollutants from vehicles.","['Malagoli, Carlotta', 'Malavolti, Marcella', 'Costanzini, Sofia', 'Fabbri, Sara', 'Tezzi, Sergio', 'Palazzi, Giovanni', 'Arcolin, Elisa', 'Vinceti, Marco']","['Malagoli C', 'Malavolti M', 'Costanzini S', 'Fabbri S', 'Tezzi S', 'Palazzi G', 'Arcolin E', 'Vinceti M']","['Centro di ricerca in epidemiologia ambientale, genetica e nutrizionale - CREAGEN, Dip.

In acute myeloid leukemia, it acts as a leukemia-associated antigen. Cyclin A1 expression has been reported in several epithelial malignancies, including testicular, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We analyzed Cyclin A1 expression in EOC and its correlation with clinical features to evaluate Cyclin A1 as a T-cell target in EOC. METHODS: Cyclin A1 mRNA expression in EOC and healthy tissues was quantified by microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein expression in clinical samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and was correlated to clinical features. RESULTS: Cyclin A1 protein was homogeneously expressed in 43 of 62 grade 3 tumor samples and in 1 of 10 grade 2 specimens (p < 0.001). Survival analysis showed longer time to progression (TTP) among patients with at least moderate Cyclin A1 expression (univariate: p = 0.018, multivariate: p = 0.035). FIGO stage, grading, age, macroscopic residual tumor after debulking, and peritoneal carcinomatosis / distant metastasis had no impact on TTP or overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION: Cyclin A1 is highly expressed in most EOCs. The mechanism behind the prolonged TTP in patients with high Cyclin A1 expression warrants further investigation. The frequent, selectively high expression of Cyclin A1 in EOC makes it a promising target for T-cell therapies.","['Arsenic, Ruza', 'Braicu, Elena Ilona', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Dietel, Manfred', 'Sehouli, Jalid', 'Keilholz, Ulrich', 'Ochsenreither, Sebastian']","['Arsenic R', 'Braicu EI', 'Letsch A', 'Dietel M', 'Sehouli J', 'Keilholz U', 'Ochsenreither S']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Pathology, Charite - University Hospital Berlin, 10117, Berlin, Germany. ruza.arsenic@charite.de.', 'Departement of Gynecology, University Hospital Berlin, 13353, Berlin, Germany. elena.braicu@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology - University Hospital Berlin, 12200, Berlin, Germany. anne.letsch@charite.de.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Pathology, Charite - University Hospital Berlin, 10117, Berlin, Germany. manfred.dietel@charite.de.', 'Departement of Gynecology, University Hospital Berlin, 13353, Berlin, Germany. jalid.sehouli@charite.de.', 'Charite Cancer Comprehensive Center, Charite, 10117, Berlin, Germany. ulrich.keilholz@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology - University Hospital Berlin, 12200, Berlin, Germany. sebastian.ochsenreither@charite.de.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151024,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carboplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclin A1/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/08/05 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1824-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1824-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Oct 24;15:784. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1824-6.,,PMC4619521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether macrophages-derived microvesicles (MVs) are involved in this process remains unknown. In the present study, the effects of macrophages-derived MVs on proliferation and migration of Schwann cells (SCs) were evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Human monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1) was successfully driven to M1 and M2 phenotypes by delivery of either IFN-gamma or IL-4, respectively. SCs incubated with M1 or M2 macrophages-derived MVs, the cell migration and proliferation were assessed, and expression levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and Laminin were measured. A rat model of sciatic nerve was established and the effects of macrophages-derived MVs on nerve regeneration were investigated. RESULTS: M2-derived MVs elevated migration, proliferation, NFG and Laminin protein levels of SCs compared with M1-or M0-derived MVs. The relative expression levels of miR-223 were also increased in M2 macrophages and M2-derived MVs. Transfected M2 macrophages with miR-223 inhibitor then co-incubated with SCs, an inhibition of cell migration and proliferation and a down-regulated levels of NFG and Laminin protein expression were observed. In vivo, M2-derived MVs significantly increased the infiltration and axon number of SCs. CONCLUSION: M2-derived MVs promoted proliferation and migration of SCs in vitro and in vivo, which provided a therapeutic strategy for nerve regeneration.","['Zhan, Chuan', 'Ma, Cheng-bin', 'Yuan, Hong-mou', 'Cao, Bao-yuan', 'Zhu, Jia-jun']","['Zhan C', 'Ma CB', 'Yuan HM', 'Cao BY', 'Zhu JJ']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110032, China.

Substantial apoptotic effects of CQAH on HCT116 and LoVo human colon cancer cell lines were observed. Apoptosis was identified based on cell morphological characteristics, including cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation as well as Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining followed by flow cytometric analysis and detection of apoptosis-associated proteins by western blot analysis. CQAH induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia-1 and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) extra large protein and elevated the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38, significantly reduced CQAH-mediated cell death as well as cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Co-treatment of CQAH with the commercial chemotherapeutics 5-fluorouracil and camptothecin-11 significantly improved their efficacies. Comparison of the apoptotic effects of CQAH with those of two illustrated structure-activity associations for this compound type, indicating that substitution at position-4 of the azetidine phenyl ring is pivotal for inducing apoptosis.

The aim of the present study was to identify proteins modulated by As4S4 and to determine their involvement in the apoptotic pathway. We used comparative proteomic analysis to screen and identify the proteins that were differentially expressed with As4S4 treatment. Prohibitin (PHB) was selected for its diverse role and its increased expression in the cells treated with As4S4. To examine whether PHB play a functional role, two clones of PHB-knockdown and PHB-overexpression were generated by transfection of NB4-R1 with vectors containing PHB gene sequences. In comparison with parental NB4-R1 cells, PHB overexpression showed an increase in baseline apoptosis and an enhanced response in As4S4-induced apoptosis. PML-RARalpha fusion protein was found to be reduced with PHB-overexpression, and following As4S4 treatment, a greater reduction of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein was seen in PHB-overexpression than that in parental cells. Consistently, PHB knockdown presented with a significant reduction in As4S4-induced apoptosis and a lesser degree of PML-RARalpha degradation.

Recent studies have revealed that developing haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are much more heterogeneous and versatile than has been previously thought. This versatility includes cells using more than one route to a fate and cells having progressed some way towards a cell type retaining other lineage options as clandestine. These notions impact substantially on our understanding of the origin and nature of leukemia. An important question is whether leukemia stem cells are as versatile as their cell of origin as an abundance of cells belonging to a lineage is often a feature of overt leukemia. In this regard, we examine the coming of age of the ""leukemia stem cell"" theory and the notion that leukemia, like normal haematopoiesis, is a hierarchically organized tissue. We examine evidence to support the notion that whilst cells that initiate leukemia have multi-lineage potential, leukemia stem cells are reprogrammed by further oncogenic insults to restrict their lineage decision-making. Accordingly, evolution of a sub-clone of lineage-restricted malignant cells is a key feature of overt leukemia.","['Brown, Geoffrey', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro']","['Brown G', 'Sanchez-Garcia I']","['School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['*Cell Lineage', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['6145 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6145 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 22;6(41):43326-41. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6145.,"['R01 CA109335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109335-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4791235,,,['NOTNLM'],"['haematopoiesis', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While there are some national guidelines published for the treatment of adult patients with ALL, and local working group recommendations do exist, there is very little detail and no preferred treatment regimens for adult patients with R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL. The aim of this study was to describe current real-world clinical practice in Europe for the management and treatment of adult R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL. METHODS: A web-based, double-blind survey was conducted in November/December 2013 in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. The survey was developed following consultation with specialist clinicians and a critical review of published literature. Eligible clinicians (15 per country) were board-certified in haemato-oncology or haematology; had at least 4 years of experience in their current role and had treated at least five patients with adult ALL in the 36 months before the survey, including at least one with R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL. RESULTS: Clinicians across the five countries consulted 16 guidelines and local working group recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL. Thirty three regimens for salvage therapy were reported; the most frequently cited was augmented hyper-CVAD (15%), with vincristine the most commonly used agent. Salvage therapy regimens involved a range of agents, and most respondents reported using at least one cytotoxic agent; across respondents 10 different cytotoxic agents were cited. All respondents reported that toxicity was common for the regimens they used to treat R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of current management and treatment patterns of R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL in the real-world clinical practice in Europe. The approach to the treatment of R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL is heterogeneous, reflecting the lack of any clearly superior chemotherapeutic option, thus it appears that clinicians are trying a wide variety of therapies. These findings show a clear need for effective, tolerable treatments for R/R Ph(-) B-precursor ALL.","['Saltman, Deborah', 'Barlev, Arie', 'Seshagiri, Divyagiri', 'Katsoulis, Ioannis', 'Lin, Vincent', 'Barber, Beth']","['Saltman D', 'Barlev A', 'Seshagiri D', 'Katsoulis I', 'Lin V', 'Barber B']","['PRMA Consulting, Fleet, UK. debsaltman@gmail.com.', 'School of Public Health, Imperial College, London, UK. debsaltman@gmail.com.', 'Amgen GHE, Thousand Oaks, USA. abarlev@amgen.com.', 'PRMA Consulting, Fleet, UK. divya.giri.4@gmail.com.', 'PRMA Consulting, Fleet, UK.

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4), which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, is localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. Due to its characteristic localization, MRP4 is proposed as a candidate in the elimination of arsenic and may contribute to resistance to As(III). To test this hypothesis, stable HEK293 cells overexpressing MRP4 or MRP2 were used to establish the role of these two transporters in As(III) resistance. The IC50 values of As(III) in MRP4 cells were approximately 6-fold higher than those in MRP2 cells, supporting an important role for MRP4 in resistance to As(III). The capacity of MRP4 to confer resistance to As(III) was further confirmed by a dramatic decrease in the IC50 values with the addition of MK571, an MRP4 inhibitor, and cyclosporine A, a well-known broad-spectrum inhibitor of ABC transporters. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of the MRP2 cells to As(III) was similar to that of the parent cells, although insufficient formation of glutathione and/or Se conjugated arsenic compounds in the MRP2 cells might limit transport. Given that MRP4 is a major contributor to arsenic resistance in vitro, further investigation into the correlation between MRP4 expression and treatment outcome of leukemia patients treated with arsenic-based regimens is warranted.","['Yuan, Bo', 'Yoshino, Yuta', 'Fukushima, Hisayo', 'Markova, Svetlana', 'Takagi, Norio', 'Toyoda, Hiroo', 'Kroetz, Deanna L']","['Yuan B', 'Yoshino Y', 'Fukushima H', 'Markova S', 'Takagi N', 'Toyoda H', 'Kroetz DL']","['Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151022,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/10/16 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.4343 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Jan;35(1):147-54. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.4343.

We present early results of a reduced-intensity (RIC) regimen utilizing fludarabine and melphalan (FM) for the treatment of advanced lymphoma. All patients with a diagnosis of lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who received Haplo-SCT at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed (N = 22). Patients received Flu 160 mg/m(2) and melphalan 100 mg/m(2) to 140 mg/m(2) with thiotepa 5 mg/kg or 2 Gy TBI. Because of concerns of increased treatment-related mortality (TRM) with the melphalan 140 mg/m(2) regimen (FM140), a RIC regimen with melphalan 100 mg/m(2) (FM100) was devised. Rituximab was included for CD20(+) disease. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of PTCy 50 mg/kg on days +3 and + 4, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Sixty-eight percent of all patients were not in complete remission at the time of transplantation. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 54%, 1-year TRM was 19%, and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 27%. Two-year PFS for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma were 57%, 51%, and 75%. Patients treated with FM100 compared to FM140 had equivalent PFS (71% versus 37%, P = .246) and OS (71% versus 58%, P = .32).

Here, we establish a mechanism of resistance and subsequently identified a suitable drug combination to overcome the resistance. Single treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib or dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitors) alone or in combination with trametinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor) resulted in overexpression of Mcl-1. Overexpression of Mcl-1 in A375 and SK-MEL-28 by transfection completely blocked BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitor-mediated inhibition of cell survival and apoptosis. Melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors showed massive expression of Mcl-1 as compared to respective sensitive cell lines. Silencing of Mcl-1 using siRNA completely sensitized resistant melanoma cells to growth suppression and induction of apoptosis by BRAF inhibitors. In vivo, vemurafenib resistant A375 xenografts implanted in athymic nude mice showed substantial tumor growth inhibition when treated with a combination of vemurafenib and Mcl-1 inhibitor or siRNA. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses demonstrated enhanced expression of Mcl-1 and activation of ERK1/2 in vemurafenib-resistant tumors whereas level of Mcl-1 or p-ERK1/2 was diminished in the tumors of mice treated with either of the combination. Biopsied tumors from the patients treated with or resistant to BRAF inhibitors revealed overexpression of Mcl-1. These results suggest that the combination of BRAF inhibitors with Mcl-1 inhibitor may have therapeutic advantage to melanoma patients with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors.","['Fofaria, Neel M', 'Frederick, Dennie T', 'Sullivan, Ryan J', 'Flaherty, Keith T', 'Srivastava, Sanjay K']","['Fofaria NM', 'Frederick DT', 'Sullivan RJ', 'Flaherty KT', 'Srivastava SK']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Cancer Biology Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Cancer Biology Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['5755 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.5755 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Dec 1;6(38):40535-56. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5755.,['R01 CA129038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4747351,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF inhibitors', 'MEK1/2 inhibitors', 'Mcl-1', 'combination therapy', 'de novo and acquired resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major obstacle for effective treatment of ATLL resides in the genetic diversity of tumor cells and their ability to acquire resistance to chemotherapy regimens. As a result, most patients relapse and current therapeutic approaches still have limited long-term survival benefits. Hence, the development of novel approaches is greatly needed. METHODS: In this study, we found that a small molecule inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), PJ-34, is very effective in activating S/G2M cell cycle checkpoints, resulting in permanent cell cycle arrest and reactivation of p53 transcription functions and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of HTLV-I-transformed and patient-derived ATLL tumor cells. We also found that HTLV-I-transformed MT-2 cells are resistant to PJ-34 therapy associated with reduced cleaved caspase-3 activation and increased expression of RelA/p65. CONCLUSION: Since PJ-34 has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors, our results suggest that some ATLL patients may be good candidates to benefit from PJ-34 therapy.","['Bai, Xue Tao', 'Moles, Ramona', 'Chaib-Mezrag, Hassiba', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bai XT', 'Moles R', 'Chaib-Mezrag H', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA. cnicot@kumc.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151023,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (N-(oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide hydrochloride)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin B1/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0217-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0217-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Oct 23;8:117. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0217-2.,"['P30 GM103326/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4619390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of mTOR signaling pathway is associated with many cancers including leukemia. Here, we report the contributions of mTOR signaling to growth of human leukemic cell lines and mouse T-cell acute leukemia (T-ALL) cells. Torin, an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, was found to have both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on U-937, THP-1, and RPMI-8226 cells, but not on Jurkat or K-562 cells. All cells were relatively resistant to rapamycin even with suppressed activity of mTOR complex 1. Growth of T-ALL cells induced by Notch1 was profoundly affected by torin partially due to increased expression of Bcl2l11 and Bbc3. Of note, activation of Akt or knockdown of FoxO1 mitigated the effect of mTOR inhibition on T-ALL cells. Our data provide insight on the effect of mTOR inhibitors on the survival and proliferation of leukemic cells, thus further improving our understanding on cell-context-dependent impacts of mTOR signaling.","['Park, Seohyun', 'Sim, Hyunsub', 'Lee, Keunwook']","['Park S', 'Sim H', 'Lee K']","['Department of Biomedical Science, College of Natural Science, Hallym University, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, College of Natural Science, Hallym University, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, College of Natural Science, Hallym University, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),BMB Rep,BMB reports,101465334,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (torin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blood Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/11/12 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['3357 [pii]', '10.5483/BMBRep.2016.49.1.201 [doi]']",ppublish,BMB Rep. 2016 Jan;49(1):63-8. doi: 10.5483/BMBRep.2016.49.1.201.,,PMC4914215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is efficacious in animal models at doses as low as 1mg/kg when administrated orally once daily. In particular, SKLB-677 but not first-generation and second-generation FLT3 inhibitors in clinical trials has the ability to inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling; Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is required for the development of LSCs, but not necessary for the development of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This compound indeed showed considerable suppression effects on leukemia stem-like cells in in vitro functional assays, but had no influence on normal HSCs. Collectively, SKLB-677 is an interesting lead compound for the treatment of AML, and deserves further investigations.","['Ma, Shuang', 'Yang, Ling-Ling', 'Niu, Ting', 'Cheng, Chuan', 'Zhong, Lei', 'Zheng, Ming-Wu', 'Xiong, Yu', 'Li, Lin-Li', 'Xiang, Rong', 'Chen, Li-Juan', 'Zhou, Qiao', 'Wei, Yu-Quan', 'Yang, Sheng-Yong']","['Ma S', 'Yang LL', 'Niu T', 'Cheng C', 'Zhong L', 'Zheng MW', 'Xiong Y', 'Li LL', 'Xiang R', 'Chen LJ', 'Zhou Q', 'Wei YQ', 'Yang SY']","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology &Research Laboratory of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151026,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0', '(1-(4-(1H-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(5-tert-butylisoxaz', 'ol-3-yl)urea)', '0', '(1-(4-(1H-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl)-3-(4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl', ')phenyl)urea)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects', 'Zebrafish', 'beta Catenin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['srep15646 [pii]', '10.1038/srep15646 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Oct 26;5:15646. doi: 10.1038/srep15646.,,PMC4620497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies investigating the biological characteristics of hypo-AML have been largely lacking. We examined the clinical and biological characteristics, as well as treatment outcomes of hypo-AML in our institutes over a seven years period. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on 631 adult AML patients diagnosed according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification and WHO classification of tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, including 43 patients with hypo-AML. Biological variables, treatment outcomes and follow-up data on hypo-AML patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 631 AML patients, 47 (7.4%) were diagnosed as hypo-AML, out of which 43 patients were evaluable. Compared with non-hypocellular AML, hypo-AML patients tended to be older (P = 0.05), more likely to present with leukocytopenia (P < 0.01) and anterior hematological diseases (P = 0.02). The overall complete remission (CR) rate, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in hypo-AML patients were comparable to those in non-hypo AML patients. Twenty-seven (62.8%) patients with hypocellular AML were treated with the standard regimen of anthracyclines and cytarabine (XA) (associated CR rate: 51.9%; median OS: 7 months; median DFS: 6.5 months). Sixteen (37.2%) patients were treated with a priming regimen containing homoharringtonine, cytarabine and G-CSF (HAG) (associated CR rate: 81.25%; median OS: 16 months; median DFS: 16 months). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prognosis of hypo-AML was not inferior to that of non-hypo AML. HAG regimen might increase response rates and improve survival in hypo-AML patients.","['Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Fu, Weijun', 'Wang, Libing', 'Gao, Lei', 'Lu, Shuqin', 'Xi, Hao', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Chen, Li', 'Chen, Jie', 'Ni, Xiong', 'Xu, Xiaoqian', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Song, Xianmin']","['Hu X', 'Fu W', 'Wang L', 'Gao L', 'Lu S', 'Xi H', 'Qiu H', 'Chen L', 'Chen J', 'Ni X', 'Xu X', 'Zhang W', 'Yang J', 'Wang J', 'Song X']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['6211 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6211 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jan 19;7(3):3623-34. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6211.,,PMC4823132,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'hypocellular', 'induction regimen', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The first cohort (three patients) was given the same initial daily dose of decitabine (5 mg/m(2)/day, five consecutive days with 4-week intervals). In all cohorts, the doses for Cycles 2 to 4 were individualized using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulations. The goal of dose individualization was to determine the maximum dose for each patient at which the occurrence of grade 4 (CTC-AE) toxicities for both platelet and neutrophil counts could be avoided. The initial doses for the following cohorts were also estimated with the data from the previous cohorts in the same manner. RESULTS: In all but one patient (14 out of 15), neutrophil count was the dose-limiting factor throughout the cycles. In cycles where doses were individualized, the median neutrophil nadir observed was 1100/mm(3) (grade 2) and grade 4 toxicity occurred in 5.1 % of all cycles (while it occurred in 36.8 % where doses were not individualized). The initial doses estimated for cohorts 2 to 5 were 4, 5, 5.5, and 5 mg/m(2)/day, respectively. The median maintenance dose was 7 mg/m(2)/day. CONCLUSIONS: We determined the acceptable starting dose and individualized the maintenance dose for each patient, while minimizing the toxicity using the adaptive approach. Currently, 5 mg/m(2)/day is considered to be the most appropriate starting dose for the regimen studied.

However, the effects of curcumin and naringenin in combination in AML cells have yet to be studied. The present study aimed to investigate the combination effects of curcumin and naringenin on the viability, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate of THP1 cells using cell viability assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Naringenin enhanced curcumininduced apoptosis and cell viability inhibition. In addition, curcumin and naringenin induced cell cycle arrest at S phase and G2/M phase. Numerous pathways, including p53, cJun Nterminal kinases (JNK), Akt and extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK)1/2 pathways were markedly altered following treatment of THP1 cells with curcumin and naringenin. These results indicated that naringenin may enhance curcumininduced apoptosis through inhibiting the Akt and ERK pathways, and promoting the JNK and p53 pathways.","['Shi, Dunyun', 'Xu, Yun', 'Du, Xin', 'Chen, Xuhong', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Lou, Jin', 'Li, Ming', 'Zhuo, Jiacai']","['Shi D', 'Xu Y', 'Du X', 'Chen X', 'Zhang X', 'Lou J', 'Li M', 'Zhuo J']","[""Institute of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518035, P.R.

Since then, EVI-1 was regarded as one of the most invasive proto-oncogenes in human leukemia. EVI-1 can encode a unique zinc-finger protein of 145 kDa that can bind with DNA, and its overexpression was closely related to human hemopoietic diseases. Furthermore, accumulating research indicates that EVI-1 is involved in the differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation of leukemia cells.

Here, we show that the primate LINE-1 5'UTR contains a primate-specific open reading frame (ORF) in the antisense orientation that we named ORF0. The gene product of this ORF localizes to promyelocytic leukemia-adjacent nuclear bodies. ORF0 is present in more than 3,000 loci across human and chimpanzee genomes and has a promoter and a conserved strong Kozak sequence that supports translation. By virtue of containing two splice donor sites, ORF0 can also form fusion proteins with proximal exons. ORF0 transcripts are readily detected in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from both primate species. Capped and polyadenylated ORF0 mRNAs are present in the cytoplasm, and endogenous ORF0 peptides are identified upon proteomic analysis. Finally, ORF0 enhances LINE-1 mobility. Taken together, these results suggest a role for ORF0 in retrotransposon-mediated diversity.","['Denli, Ahmet M', 'Narvaiza, Inigo', 'Kerman, Bilal E', 'Pena, Monique', 'Benner, Christopher', 'Marchetto, Maria C N', 'Diedrich, Jolene K', 'Aslanian, Aaron', 'Ma, Jiao', 'Moresco, James J', 'Moore, Lynne', 'Hunter, Tony', 'Saghatelian, Alan', 'Gage, Fred H']","['Denli AM', 'Narvaiza I', 'Kerman BE', 'Pena M', 'Benner C', 'Marchetto MC', 'Diedrich JK', 'Aslanian A', 'Ma J', 'Moresco JJ', 'Moore L', 'Hunter T', 'Saghatelian A', 'Gage FH']","['Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Mass Spectrometry Center, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'Mass Spectrometry Center, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Cancer Center, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny (CARTA), University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA; Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind (KIBM), University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.

METHODS: The clinical data of 27 untreated AML patients who received the IAC regimen as primary induction therapy in our hospital between April and November 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. The treatment outcomes of the IAC regimen were compared with two IA (IDA + Ara-C) regimens (IDA 10 mg/m(2) and IDA 12 mg/m(2)) in a pair-matched analysis. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate in the IAC arm was higher compared to the IA(L) arm (p = 0.002) as was the overall efficacy rate (p = 0.017). There was no significant difference in outcomes between the IAC and IA(H) (Ara-C with high-dose IDA) arms. The IAC arm contained significantly higher CR rates than the IA(L) (Ara-C with low-dose IDA) arm in both the intermediate group (p = 0.050) and the unfavorable group (p = 0.013). Toxicity did not differ between the IAC group and the other two arms. High WBC at diagnosis (p = 0.022) and an unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.026) were related to a poorer response. The IAC regimen (p = 0.013) had greater superiority over the IAL regimen on efficacy than over the IA(H) regimen (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The IAC regimen achieved a more significant advantage over the IA(L) regimen without increasing the risk of adverse events. The efficacy of induction therapy is associated with WBC at diagnosis, karyotype and induction regimen.","['Shen, Yaoyao', 'Chen, Jia', 'Liu, Yuejun', 'Wu, Depei']","['Shen Y', 'Chen J', 'Liu Y', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, and Suzhou Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151024,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/04/02 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['000440943 [pii]', '10.1159/000440943 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2014;60(5-6):368-74. doi: 10.1159/000440943.

We show that the lncRNA steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) participates in regulation through complex formation with trithorax group (TrxG) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complexes. Binding of the SRA-associated RNA helicase p68 preferentially stabilizes complex formation between SRA and a TrxG complex but not PRC2. In human pluripotent stem cells NTERA2, SRA binding sites that are also occupied by p68 are significantly enriched for H3K4 trimethylation. Consistent with its ability to interact with TrxG and PRC2 complexes, some SRA binding sites in human pluripotent stem cells overlap with bivalent domains. CTCF sites associated with SRA appear also to be enriched for bivalent modifications. We identify NANOG as a transcription factor directly interacting with SRA and co-localizing with it genome-wide in NTERA2. Further, we show that SRA is important for maintaining the stem cell state and for reprogramming of human fibroblasts to achieve the pluripotent state. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby the lncRNA SRA interacts with either TrxG or PRC2. These complexes may then be recruited by various DNA binding factors to deliver either activating or silencing signals, or both, to establish bivalent domains.","['Wongtrakoongate, Patompon', 'Riddick, Gregory', 'Fucharoen, Suthat', 'Felsenfeld, Gary']","['Wongtrakoongate P', 'Riddick G', 'Fucharoen S', 'Felsenfeld G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Thalassemia Research Center, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Nakhonpathom, Thailand.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151023,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (steroid receptor RNA activator)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics']",2015/10/27 06:00,2016/06/01 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1005615 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-15-00929 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2015 Oct 23;11(10):e1005615. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005615. eCollection 2015 Oct.,"['Z01 DK036148/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'DK036148-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4619771,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Archazolid A reduced growth and potently induced death of leukemic cell lines and human leukemic samples. By inhibiting lysosomal acidification, Archazolid A blocked activation of the Notch pathway, however, this was not the mechanism of V-ATPase inhibition relevant for cell death induction. In fact, V-ATPase inhibition by Archazolid A decreased the anti-apoptotic protein survivin. As underlying mode of action, this work is in line with recent studies from our group demonstrating that Archazolid A induced S-phase cell cycle arrest by interfering with the iron metabolism in leukemic cells.

However, the factors determining therapeutic efficacy remain elusive. Here we identified the molecular basis of acquired resistance to CHR2863, an orally available hydrophobic aminopeptidase inhibitor prodrug with an esterase-sensitive motif, in myeloid leukemia cells. CHR2863 enters cells by diffusion and is retained therein upon esterase activity-mediated conversion to its hydrophilic active metabolite drug CHR6768, thereby exerting amino acid depletion. Carboxylesterases (CES) serve as candidate prodrug activating enzymes given CES1 expression in acute myeloid leukemia specimens. We established two novel myeloid leukemia sublines U937/CHR2863(200) and U937/CHR2863(5uM), with low (14-fold) and high level (270-fold) CHR2863 resistance. The latter drug resistant cells displayed: (i) complete loss of CES1-mediated drug activation associated with down-regulation of CES1 mRNA and protein, (ii) marked retention/sequestration of the prodrug, (iii) a substantial increase in intracellular lipid droplets, and (iv) a dominant activation of the pro-survival Akt/mTOR pathway. Remarkably, the latter feature coincided with a gain of sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These finding delineate the molecular basis of CHR2863 resistance and offer a novel modality to overcome this drug resistance in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Verbrugge, Sue Ellen', 'Al, Marjon', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Kammerer, Sarah', 'Chandrupatla, Durga M S H', 'Honeywell, Richard', 'Musters, Rene P J', 'Giovannetti, Elisa', ""O'Toole, Tom"", 'Scheffer, George L', 'Krige, David', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Niessen, Hans W M', 'Lems, Willem F', 'Kramer, Pieternella A', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Jansen, Gerrit']","['Verbrugge SE', 'Al M', 'Assaraf YG', 'Kammerer S', 'Chandrupatla DM', 'Honeywell R', 'Musters RP', 'Giovannetti E', ""O'Toole T"", 'Scheffer GL', 'Krige D', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Niessen HW', 'Lems WF', 'Kramer PA', 'Scheper RJ', 'Cloos J', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Peters GJ', 'Jansen G']","['Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Present address: Department of Clinical Chemistry, UMCU, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Fred Wyszkowsky Cancer Research Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Present address: Institute of Biophysics, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Physiology, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Departments of Pathology and Cardiac Surgery, ICaR-VU, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Chroma Therapeutics Ltd, Abingdon, United Kingdom.', 'Present address: Immunocore Ltd, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Departments of Pathology and Cardiac Surgery, ICaR-VU, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Isala Hospital, Zwolle, The Netherlands.', 'Departments of Pathology and Cardiac Surgery, ICaR-VU, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Prodrugs)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipid Droplets', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prodrugs/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",2015/10/27 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2015/10/27 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['6169 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6169 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 2;7(5):5240-57. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6169.,,PMC4868683,,,['NOTNLM'],"['aminopeptidase', 'carboxylesterase', 'lipid droplets', 'mTOR', 'rapamycin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improvements in the up-front therapy, survival after relapse is still relatively poor, especially for high-risk relapses. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes following acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse after common initial Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology protocol treatment; to validate currently used risk stratifications, and identify additional prognostic factors for overall survival. Altogether, 516 of 2735 patients (18.9%) relapsed between 1992 and 2011 and were included in the study. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome between the up-front protocols or between the relapse protocols used, but an improvement over time was observed. The 5-year overall survival for patients relapsing in the period 2002-2011 was 57.5+/-3.4%, but 44.7+/-3.2% (P<0.001) if relapse occurred in the period 1992-2001. Factors independently predicting mortality after relapse included short duration of first remission, bone marrow involvement, age ten years or over, unfavorable cytogenetics, and Down syndrome. T-cell immunophenotype was not an independent prognostic factor unless in combination with hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis. The outcome for early combined pre-B relapses was unexpectedly poor (5-year overall survival 38.0+/-10.6%), which supports the notion that these patients need further risk adjustment. Although survival outcomes have improved over time, the development of novel approaches is urgently needed to increase survival in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Oskarsson, Trausti', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Arvidson, Johan', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Montgomery, Scott', 'Bottai, Matteo', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Carlsen, Niels', 'Hellebostad, Marit', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Heyman, Mats']","['Oskarsson T', 'Soderhall S', 'Arvidson J', 'Forestier E', 'Montgomery S', 'Bottai M', 'Lausen B', 'Carlsen N', 'Hellebostad M', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Jonsson OG', 'Heyman M']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden trausti.oskarsson@ki.se."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Umea University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine and Health, Orebro University, Sweden Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, UK.', 'Unit of Biostatistics, IMM, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Rigshospitalet University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Odense University Hospital, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ulleval Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland."", ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.""]","['Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL relapse working', 'group']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20151022,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",2015/10/24 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.131680 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.131680 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Jan;101(1):68-76. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.131680.

Previous studies have suggested hematologists' limited awareness of PCS as one of the reason for low PCS referral in hematology. However, little is known about such an awareness and potential barriers to collaboration between hematologists and PCS. AIM: The present study aimed to assess ematologists and palliative care specialists' perception about the roles of the hospital-based palliative care team (HPCT) and the barriers to collaboration between hematologists and palliative care teams on relapse or refractory leukemia and malignant lymphoma patients' care MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using semistructured interviews with hematologists and palliative care specialists recruited from a hospital that provides hematology and palliative care by the HPCT. Data were evaluated via content analysis. RESULTS: The study included 11 hematologists and 10 palliative care specialists. Our results revealed that they shared many common perceptions about the roles and expectations of the HPCT. Additionally, 7 categories of barriers to collaboration were identified, including not feeling the need to refer, the difficulty in referral timing, the lack of aggressive approach, the negative image of the HPCT, the need for hematologic malignancy-oriented management, the lack of communication, and others. CONCLUSION: We have identified hematologists' and palliative care specialists' perceptions of the HPCT's roles and the barriers to their collaboration. A better understanding of such barriers may lead to effective collaboration between hematologists and the HPCT.","['Morikawa, Miharu', 'Shirai, Yuki', 'Ochiai, Ryota', 'Miyagawa, Kiyoshi']","['Morikawa M', 'Shirai Y', 'Ochiai R', 'Miyagawa K']","['The Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan morikawamh@jikei.ac.jp.', 'Certified Nurse Specialist Course in Cancer Nursing, School of Health Sciences and Nursing, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'School of Health Sciences and Nursing, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Asoka Vihara Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'School of Medicine Nursing Course, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Radiology, Center for Disease Biology and Integrative Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151022,United States,Am J Hosp Palliat Care,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,9008229,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Communication', '*Cooperative Behavior', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Hematology/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/*organization & administration', 'Patient Care Team', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recurrence']",2016/11/03 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['1049909115611081 [pii]', '10.1177/1049909115611081 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hosp Palliat Care. 2016 Dec;33(10):977-984. doi: 10.1177/1049909115611081.

Current models emphasize the role of BH3-only BCL2 family members in BAX and BAK activation. Here we demonstrate concentration-dependent BAK autoactivation under cell-free conditions and provide evidence that this autoactivation plays a key role in regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in intact cells. In particular, we show that up to 80% of BAK (but not BAX) in lymphohematopoietic cell lines is oligomerized and bound to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members in the absence of exogenous death stimuli. The extent of this constitutive BAK oligomerization is diminished by BAK knockdown and unaffected by BIM or PUMA down-regulation. Further analysis indicates that sensitivity of cells to BH3 mimetics reflects the identity of the anti-apoptotic proteins to which BAK is constitutively bound, with extensive BCLXL*BAK complexes predicting navitoclax sensitivity, and extensive MCL1*BAK complexes predicting A1210477 sensitivity. Moreover, high BAK expression correlates with sensitivity of clinical acute myelogenous leukemia to chemotherapy, whereas low BAK levels correlate with resistance and relapse. Collectively, these results inform current understanding of MOMP and provide new insight into the ability of BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis without directly activating BAX or BAK.","['Dai, Haiming', 'Ding, Husheng', 'Meng, X Wei', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Dai H', 'Ding H', 'Meng XW', 'Peterson KL', 'Schneider PA', 'Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA; Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA; Center for Medical Physics and Technology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Science, Hefei 230031, China;', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA;', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA; Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA;', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA;', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA;', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA; Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA;']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2015/10/24 06:00,2016/01/30 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['29/20/2140 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.267997.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2015 Oct 15;29(20):2140-52. doi: 10.1101/gad.267997.115.,"['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4617978,,['(c) 2015 Dai et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],['NOTNLM'],"['BAK', 'BH3 mimetic', 'apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JMJD1C is directly recruited by RUNX1-RUNX1T1 to its target genes and regulates their expression by maintaining low H3K9 dimethyl (H3K9me2) levels. Analyses in JMJD1C knockout mice also establish a JMJD1C requirement for RUNX1-RUNX1T1's ability to increase proliferation.

We in this study aimed to investigate the function of miR130a in p53 tumor suppressor signaling pathway. We performed microRNA (miRNA) expression profile analysis in CML cancer stem cells of 38 cases and extracted total RNA from peripheral blood of 143 cases. Standard curves of U6 and miRNA were made from 10-fold serial dilutions of the cDNA, which were quantified using real-time quantitative PCR with SYBR Green by ABI 7300. The p53 mutations and BCR/ABL mutation status analysis in CML patients were detected by PCR and direct sequencing. Candidate targets of miR130a of putative relevance in CML pathogenesis were analyzed by bioinformatics approach. We then used dual-luciferase activity assay to verify the target genes of miR130a and used western blot analysis to elucidate the mechanism of miR130a on modulating drug resistance. The levels of miR-130a expression in CML were significantly lower in poor prognostic subgroups, defined by prognostic factors including mutated BCR/ABL status, p53 and ATM deletions and p53 mutations. Furthermore, underexpression of miR-130a was significantly associated with shorter overall survival and treatment-free survival in CML patients. We demonstrated that miR130a function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting multiple anti-apoptosis proteins, including BCL-2, MCL-1 and XIAP. This was a direct effect because miR130a negatively regulated expression of a BCL-2/MCL-1/XIAP 3'untranslated region-based reporter construct. Transfection of miR130a mimics into CML cells from 30 patients without p53 aberrations led to significant increases in apoptosis compared with transfection with the miRNA control. Besides, enforced expression of miR130a had no significant drug-sensitization effect in CML cells from p53-attenuated patients. MiR-130a may have an important role in the pathogenesis of CML and may be useful for assessing prognosis in patients with CML.

On the contrary, As2 O3 has been an ancient drug used in traditional Chinese medicine with substantial anticancer activities, especially in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia as well as chronic wound healing. However, the cytotoxicity and detail mechanisms of As2 O3 action in solid cancer cells, such as oral cancer cells, are largely unknown. In this study, we have primarily cultured four pairs of tumor and nontumor cells from the oral cancer patients and treated the cells with As2 O3 alone or combined with dithiothreitol (DTT). The results showed that 0.5 muM As2 O3 plus 20 muM DTT caused a significant cell death of oral cancer cells but not the nontumor cells. Also As2 O3 plus DTT upregulated Bax and Bak, downregulated Bcl-2 and p53, caused a loss of mitochondria membrane potential in oral cancer cells. On the other way, As2 O3 also triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased the levels of glucose-regulated protein 78, calpain 1 and 2. Our results suggest that DTT could synergistically enhance the effects of As2 O3 on killing oral cancer cells while nontoxic to the nontumor cells. The combination is promising for clinical practice in oral cancer therapy and worth further investigations. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, due to an uncertain scientific basis and the increasing emergence of resistant germs, this policy should be questioned. Therefore, FQ and fluconazole prophylaxis was omitted in alloHCT at our center. In this retrospective analysis, all consecutive patients (n = 63) who underwent first alloHCT at our institution from September 2010 to September 2013 were included. Patients neither received FQ nor fluconazole prophylaxis. Day 100 mortality, incidence of febrile neutropenia, bacterial infections, and invasive fungal diseases (IFD) were assessed. Sixteen patients who started conditioning under antimicrobial treatment/prophylaxis due to pre-existing neutropenia (3/16), IFD (12/16), or aortic valve replacement (1/16) were excluded from the analysis. Finally, 47 patients were transplanted without prophylaxis as intended. Day 100 mortality was 9 %. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 62 % (29/47); 17/47 patients (36 %) experienced a blood stream infection (BSI) with detection of Gram-positive bacteria in 14 patients, Gram-negative bacteria in five patients, and candida in one patient, respectively. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria; 12/21 isolated Gram-positive and 3/6 Gram-negative bacteria were FQ resistant. In 21 % (10/47) of the patients, IFD (1x proven, 1x probable, and 8x possible) were diagnosed. To conclude, all three criteria, day 100 mortality, the incidence of IFD, and BSI, are in the range of published data for patients transplanted with FQ and fluconazole prophylaxis.

Here, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 87 patients with ALL and a history of CNS involvement who later underwent alloHCT. Patients with pretransplantation CNS involvement had higher risk of CNS relapse after transplantation (2-year CNS relapse: 9.6% versus 1.4%, P < .0001), inferior event-free survival (EFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52; P = .003), and worse overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.55; P = .003) compared with patients without pretransplantation CNS involvement (n = 543). There was no difference in post-transplantation CNS relapse, EFS, or OS among patients presenting with CNS involvement at diagnosis, those with isolated CNS relapse, and those with combined bone marrow and CNS relapse before HCT. Interestingly, neither pretransplantation cranial irradiation, use of total body irradiation-based conditioning, nor post-transplantation prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy were associated with a reduction of CNS relapse risk after transplantation.

In this retrospective multicenter study, we analyzed outcomes of patients who underwent HCT for MF with prior exposure to JAK1/2 inhibitors. One hundred consecutive patients from participating centers were analyzed, and based on clinical status and response to JAK1/2 inhibitors at the time of HCT, patients were stratified into 5 groups: (1) clinical improvement (n = 23), (2) stable disease (n = 31), (3) new cytopenia/increasing blasts/intolerance (n = 15), (4) progressive disease: splenomegaly (n = 18), and (5) progressive disease: leukemic transformation (LT) (n = 13). Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49% to 71%). OS was 91% (95% CI, 69% to 98%) for those who experienced clinical improvement and 32% (95% CI, 8% to 59%) for those who developed LT on JAK1/2 inhibitors. In multivariable analysis, response to JAK1/2 inhibitors (P = .03), dynamic international prognostic scoring system score (P = .003), and donor type (P = .006) were independent predictors of survival. Among the 66 patients who remained on JAK1/2 inhibitors until stopped for HCT, 2 patients developed serious adverse events necessitating delay of HCT and another 8 patients had symptoms with lesser severity. Adverse events were more common in patients who started tapering or abruptly stopped their regular dose >/=6 days before conditioning therapy. We conclude that prior exposure to JAK1/2 inhibitors did not adversely affect post-transplantation outcomes. Our data suggest that JAK1/2 inhibitors should be continued near to the start of conditioning therapy. The favorable outcomes of patients who experienced clinical improvement with JAK1/2 inhibitor therapy before HCT were particularly encouraging, and need further prospective validation.","['Shanavas, Mohamed', 'Popat, Uday', 'Michaelis, Laura C', 'Fauble, Veena', 'McLornan, Donal', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Arcasoy, Murat O', 'Davies, James', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Ukaegbu, Oluchi C', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Storring, John M', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Pagliuca, Antonio', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Ernst, Brenda', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Hanif, Ahmad', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Hari, Paremeswaran', 'Gupta, Vikas']","['Shanavas M', 'Popat U', 'Michaelis LC', 'Fauble V', 'McLornan D', 'Klisovic R', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Tamari R', 'Arcasoy MO', 'Davies J', 'Gergis U', 'Ukaegbu OC', 'Kamble RT', 'Storring JM', 'Majhail NS', 'Romee R', 'Verstovsek S', 'Pagliuca A', 'Vasu S', 'Ernst B', 'Atenafu EG', 'Hanif A', 'Champlin R', 'Hari P', 'Gupta V']","['MPN Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Scottsdale, Arizona.', ""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy and Hematologic Malignancies, Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Oxford University Hospitals NHS trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine and Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Hanns A.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The LD50 values of ABT-737, ABT-263 and ABT-199 in a number of primary CLL cells from 40 patients, were determined. The levels of Bcl-2 family proteins, including phosphorylated Bcl-2 (pBcl-2) and their interactions were measured by immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation. In vitro binding assays were performed by isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA. BH3 profiling in isolated mitochondria was analysed. KEY RESULTS: The ratio of (Mcl-1 + pBcl-2) to Bcl-2 expression provided the most significant predictive marker for the cytotoxic potential of ABT-737, ABT-263 and ABT-199 in the panel of CLL samples. Mechanistically, pBcl-2 inhibited the effects of the ABT compounds on the displacement of Bax and Bim from Bcl-2, thereby suppressing mitochondrial apoptosis. The ABT compounds exhibited 100-300-fold lower binding affinity to the glutamic acid, phosphomimetic, mutant of Bcl-2 (T69E, S70E and S87E; EEE-Bcl-2). BH3 peptides exhibited different rank orders of binding affinities to full-length WT-Bcl-2 and full-length EEE-Bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggested that a structural alteration in the BH3-binding groove was induced by phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Our data also provided a framework to overcome resistance of CLL cells to the ABT compounds by combining pBcl-2 kinase inhibitors with the ABT compounds.","['Song, Ting', 'Chai, Gaobo', 'Liu, Yubo', 'Yu, Xiaoyan', 'Wang, Ziqian', 'Zhang, Zhichao']","['Song T', 'Chai G', 'Liu Y', 'Yu X', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemistry, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160116,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2015/10/24 06:00,2016/11/02 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bph.13370 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2016 Feb;173(3):471-83. doi: 10.1111/bph.13370.

Genetic abnormalities were found in all 51 cases with T-PLL, most frequently involving the TCRA/D locus (86%). Deletions were detected for ATM (69%) and TP53 (31%), whereas i(8)(q10) was observed in 61% of cases. Mutations in ATM, TP53, JAK1, and JAK3 were detected in 73, 14, 6, and 21% of patients, respectively. Additionally, BCOR mutations were observed for the first time in a lymphoid malignancy (8%). Two distinct genetic subgroups of T-PLL were identified: A large subset (86% of patients) showed abnormalities involving the TCRA/D locus activating the proto-oncogenes TCL1 or MTCP1, while the second group was characterized by a high frequency of TP53 mutations (4/7 cases). Further, analyses of overall survival identified JAK3 mutations as important prognostic marker, showing a significant negative impact.","['Stengel, Anna', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Zenger, Melanie', 'Perglerova, Karolina', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Stengel A', 'Kern W', 'Zenger M', 'Perglerova K', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'MLL2 S.R.O., KCD4, Kolbenova 609/40, 190 00 Praha 9, Czech Republic.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, 81377, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, 81377, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151023,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/10/24 06:00,2016/10/16 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2015/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22313 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2016 Jan;55(1):82-94. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22313.

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) achieved a high response rate, but continued relapses were seen in initial reports. We reviewed the original 300 patient phase 2 FCR study to identify long-term disease-free survivors. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed posttreatment by a polymerase chain reaction-based ligase chain reaction assay (sensitivity 0.01%). At the median follow-up of 12.8 years, PFS was 30.9% (median PFS, 6.4 years). The 12.8-year PFS was 53.9% for patients with mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene (IGHV-M) and 8.7% for patients with unmutated IGHV (IGHV-UM). 50.7% of patients with IGHV-M achieved MRD-negativity posttreatment; of these, PFS was 79.8% at 12.8 years. A plateau was seen on the PFS curve in patients with IGHV-M, with no relapses beyond 10.4 years in 42 patients (total follow-up 105.4 patient-years). On multivariable analysis, IGHV-UM (hazard ratio, 3.37 [2.18-5.21]; P < .001) and del(17p) by conventional karyotyping (hazard ratio, 7.96 [1.02-61.92]; P = .048) were significantly associated with inferior PFS. Fifteen patients with IGHV-M had 4-color MRD flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.01%) performed in peripheral blood, at a median of 12.8 years posttreatment (range, 9.5-14.7). All were MRD-negative. The high rate of very long-term PFS in patients with IGHV-M after FCR argues for the continued use of chemoimmunotherapy in this patient subgroup outside clinical trials; alternative strategies may be preferred in patients with IGHV-UM, to limit long-term toxicity.","['Thompson, Philip A', 'Tam, Constantine S', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Wierda, William G', 'Stingo, Francesco', 'Plunkett, William', 'Smith, Susan C', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Thompson PA', 'Tam CS', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Wierda WG', 'Stingo F', 'Plunkett W', 'Smith SC', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Freireich EJ', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, Australia;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/24 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2015/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30535-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-09-667675 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jan 21;127(3):303-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-09-667675.

We screened 59 individuals from 17 families with 2 or more biological relatives with MDS/AML for variants in 12 genes with established roles in predisposition to MDS/AML, and identified a pathogenic germ line variant in 5 families (29%). Extending the screen with a panel of 264 genes that are recurrently mutated in de novo AML, we identified rare, nonsynonymous germ line variants in 4 genes, each segregating with MDS/AML in 2 families. Somatic mutations are required for progression to MDS/AML in these familial cases. Using a combination of targeted and exome sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples from 26 familial MDS/AML cases and asymptomatic carriers, we identified recurrent frameshift mutations in the cohesin-associated factor PDS5B, co-occurrence of somatic ASXL1 mutations with germ line GATA2 mutations, and recurrent mutations in other known MDS/AML drivers. Mutations in genes that are recurrently mutated in de novo AML were underrepresented in the familial MDS/AML cases, although the total number of somatic mutations per exome was the same. Lastly, clonal skewing of hematopoiesis was detected in 67% of young, asymptomatic RUNX1 carriers, providing a potential biomarker that could be used for surveillance in these high-risk families.","['Churpek, Jane E', 'Pyrtel, Khateriaa', 'Kanchi, Krishna-Latha', 'Shao, Jin', 'Koboldt, Daniel', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Shen, Dong', 'Fulton, Robert', ""O'Laughlin, Michelle"", 'Fronick, Catrina', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Braunstein, Evan M', 'Levis, Mark', 'Ross, Julie', 'Elliott, Kevin', 'Heath, Sharon', 'Jiang, Allan', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Welch, John', 'Wilson, Richard', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Graubert, Timothy A']","['Churpek JE', 'Pyrtel K', 'Kanchi KL', 'Shao J', 'Koboldt D', 'Miller CA', 'Shen D', 'Fulton R', ""O'Laughlin M"", 'Fronick C', 'Pusic I', 'Uy GL', 'Braunstein EM', 'Levis M', 'Ross J', 'Elliott K', 'Heath S', 'Jiang A', 'Westervelt P', 'DiPersio JF', 'Link DC', 'Walter MJ', 'Welch J', 'Wilson R', 'Ley TJ', 'Godley LA', 'Graubert TA']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL;', 'Siteman Cancer Center.', 'The Genome Institute, and.', 'Siteman Cancer Center.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, The Genome Institute, and Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'The Genome Institute, and.', 'Medimmune/AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD;', 'The Genome Institute, and.', 'The Genome Institute, and.', 'The Genome Institute, and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD;', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; and.', 'Siteman Cancer Center.', 'Siteman Cancer Center.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Siteman Cancer Center, The Genome Institute, and.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, The Genome Institute, and Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO;', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL;', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDS5B protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Exome', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*genetics', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2015/10/24 06:00,2016/03/19 06:00,['2015/10/24 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30706-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-04-641100 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Nov 26;126(22):2484-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-04-641100.

In the same time period our understanding of the optimal management of PV has expanded, most recently culminating in the approval of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to therapy with hydroxycarbamide. It has also been demonstrated that life expectancy for many patients with PV is not normal, nor is their quality of life. We critically explore these findings and discuss their impact. In addition, we highlight persisting gaps in our current management strategy; for example, what is the optimal first line cytoreductive therapy and, indeed, which patients need cytoreductive drugs.","['McMullin, Mary F', 'Wilkins, Bridget S', 'Harrison, Claire N']","['McMullin MF', 'Wilkins BS', 'Harrison CN']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University, Belfast, UK."", ""Departments of Cellular Pathology and Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", ""Departments of Cellular Pathology and Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20151022,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Disease Management', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Nitriles', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Risk Factors']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13812 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Feb;172(3):337-49. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13812.

Cellular arrays using peptide-MHC (pMHC) tetramers allow the simultaneous detection of different antigen specific T-cell populations naturally circulating in patients and normal donors. We have developed the pMHC array to detect CD8+ T-cell populations in leukaemia patients that recognise epitopes within viral antigens (cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza (Flu)) and leukaemia antigens (including Per Arnt Sim domain 1 (PASD1), MelanA, Wilms' Tumour (WT1) and tyrosinase). We show that the pMHC array is at least as sensitive as flow cytometry and has the potential to rapidly identify more than 40 specific T-cell populations in a small sample of T-cells (0.8-1.4 x 10(6)). Fourteen of the twenty-six acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients analysed had T cells that recognised tumour antigen epitopes, and eight of these recognised PASD1 epitopes. Other tumour epitopes recognised were MelanA (n = 3), tyrosinase (n = 3) and WT1(126-134) (n = 1). One of the seven acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) patients analysed had T cells that recognised the MUC1(950-958) epitope. In the future the pMHC array may be used provide point of care T-cell analyses, predict patient response to conventional therapy and direct personalised immunotherapy for patients.","['Brooks, Suzanne E', 'Bonney, Stephanie A', 'Lee, Cindy', 'Publicover, Amy', 'Khan, Ghazala', 'Smits, Evelien L', 'Sigurdardottir, Dagmar', 'Arno, Matthew', 'Li, Demin', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Pulford, Karen', 'Banham, Alison H', 'van Tendeloo, Viggo', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Elliott, Tim J', 'Orchard, Kim H', 'Guinn, Barbara-ann']","['Brooks SE', 'Bonney SA', 'Lee C', 'Publicover A', 'Khan G', 'Smits EL', 'Sigurdardottir D', 'Arno M', 'Li D', 'Mills KI', 'Pulford K', 'Banham AH', 'van Tendeloo V', 'Mufti GJ', 'Rammensee HG', 'Elliott TJ', 'Orchard KH', 'Guinn BA']","['Cancer Sciences Unit (MP824), Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit (MP824), Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit (MP824), Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Bedfordshire, Park Square, Luton, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Haematology, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, B-2650 Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""King's Genomics Centre, School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.', ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", 'Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Haematology, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, B-2650 Antwerp, Belgium.', ""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit (MP824), Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', ""Cancer Sciences Unit (MP824), Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Department of Life Sciences, University of Bedfordshire, Park Square, Luton, United Kingdom; Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151022,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (PASD1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0140483 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-24567 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Oct 22;10(10):e0140483. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0140483. eCollection 2015.,['10702/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],PMC4619595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a large-scale screening approach identified salinomycin and nigericin as selective apoptosis inducers of cancer stem cells. Growing evidence suggests that salinomycin is able to kill different types of non-stem tumor cells that usually display resistance to common therapeutic approaches, but the mechanism of action of this molecule is still poorly understood. Since salinomycin has been suggested to act as a K(+) ionophore, we explored its impact on mitochondrial bioenergetic performance at an early time point following drug application. In contrast to the K(+) ionophore valinomycin, salinomycin induced a rapid hyperpolarization. In addition, mitochondrial matrix acidification and a significant decrease of respiration were observed in intact mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in cancer stem cell-like HMLE cells within tens of minutes, while increased production of reactive oxygen species was not detected. By comparing the chemical structures and cellular effects of this drug with those of valinomycin (K(+) ionophore) and nigericin (K(+)/H(+) exchanger), we conclude that salinomycin mediates K(+)/H(+) exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Compatible with its direct modulation of mitochondrial function, salinomycin was able to induce cell death also in Bax/Bak-less double-knockout MEF cells. Since at the concentration range used in most studies (around 10 muM) salinomycin exerts its effect at the level of mitochondria and alters bioenergetic performance, the specificity of its action on pathologic B cells isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) versus B cells from healthy subjects was investigated. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), proposed to mimic the tumor environment, attenuated the apoptotic effect of salinomycin on B-CLL cells. Apoptosis occurred to a significant extent in healthy B cells as well as in MSCs and human primary fibroblasts. The results indicate that salinomycin, when used above muM concentrations, exerts direct, mitochondrial effects, thus compromising cell survival.","['Manago, A', 'Leanza, L', 'Carraretto, L', 'Sassi, N', 'Grancara, S', 'Quintana-Cabrera, R', 'Trimarco, V', 'Toninello, A', 'Scorrano, L', 'Trentin, L', 'Semenzato, G', 'Gulbins, E', 'Zoratti, M', 'Szabo, I']","['Manago A', 'Leanza L', 'Carraretto L', 'Sassi N', 'Grancara S', 'Quintana-Cabrera R', 'Trimarco V', 'Toninello A', 'Scorrano L', 'Trentin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Gulbins E', 'Zoratti M', 'Szabo I']","['Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padua, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151022,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Pyrans)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', '62UXS86T64 (salinomycin)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)']",IM,"['Acid-Base Equilibrium', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/06/22 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2015263 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.263 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Oct 22;6:e1930. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.263.,,PMC4632293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1960, Nowell and Hungerford discovered an invariable association between the Philadelphia chromosome (subsequently shown to harbor the causal BCR-ABL1 mutation) and CML; accordingly, the term MPN is primarily reserved for PV, ET, and PMF, although it includes other related clinicopathologic entities, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. In 2005, William Vainchenker and others described a Janus kinase 2 mutation (JAK2V617F) in MPN and this was followed by a series of additional descriptions of mutations that directly or indirectly activate JAK-STAT: JAK2 exon 12, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) mutations. The discovery of these, mostly mutually exclusive, ""driver"" mutations has contributed to revisions of the WHO diagnostic criteria and risk stratification in MPN. Mutations other than JAK2, CALR and MPL have also been described in MPN and shown to provide additional prognostic information. From the standpoint of treatment, over the last 50 years, Louis Wasserman from the Unites States and Tiziano Barbui from Italy had skillfully organized and led a number of important clinical trials, whose results form the basis for current treatment strategies in MPN. More recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant, as a potentially curative treatment modality, and JAK inhibitors, as palliative drugs, have been added to the overall therapeutic armamentarium in myelofibrosis. In the current review, I will summarize the important advances made in the last 10 years regarding the science and practice of MPN.","['Tefferi, Ayalew']",['Tefferi A'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/mortality/*therapy']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/05/31 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24221 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 Jan;91(1):50-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24221.,,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large-scale cytometry datasets often exhibit some within-class variation due to technical effects such as instrumental differences and variations in data acquisition, as well as subtle biological heterogeneity within the class of samples. Failure to account for such variations in the model may lead to inaccurate matching of populations across a batch of samples and poor performance in classification of unlabeled samples. In this paper, we describe the Joint Clustering and Matching (JCM) procedure for simultaneous segmentation and alignment of cell populations across multiple samples. Under the JCM framework, a multivariate mixture distribution is used to model the distribution of the expressions of a fixed set of markers for each cell in a sample such that the components in the mixture model may correspond to the various populations of cells, which have similar expressions of markers (that is, clusters), in the composition of the sample. For each class of samples, an overall class template is formed by the adoption of random-effects terms to model the inter-sample variation within a class. The construction of a parametric template for each class allows for direct quantification of the differences between the template and each sample, and also between each pair of samples, both within or between classes. The classification of a new unclassified sample is then undertaken by assigning the unclassified sample to the class that minimizes the distance between its fitted mixture density and each class density as provided by the class templates. For illustration, we use a symmetric form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a distance measure between two densities, but other distance measures can also be applied. We show and demonstrate on four real datasets how the JCM procedure can be used to carry out the tasks of automated clustering and alignment of cell populations, and supervised classification of samples.","['Lee, Sharon X', 'McLachlan, Geoffrey J', 'Pyne, Saumyadipta']","['Lee SX', 'McLachlan GJ', 'Pyne S']","['Department of Mathematics, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, 4072, Australia.', 'Department of Mathematics, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, 4072, Australia.', 'Indian Institute of Public Health Hyderabad (IIPHH), Plot No. 1, A.N.V.

Among them, 323 (95%) achieved complete remission (CR) and were included in this study. Median age was 52 years (range, 15-84). Median white blood cell count (WBC) was 9.35 x 10(9) /l (range, 0.4-658.1 x1 0(9) /l). MRD by MFC was initially assessed with a sensitivity of 0.01%, using a 15-marker, 4-colour panel and subsequently a 6-colour panel on bone marrow specimens obtained at CR achievement and at approximately 3 month intervals thereafter. MRD negative status at CR was associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively). Similarly, achieving MRD negative status at approximately 3 and 6 months was associated with improved DFS (P = 0.004 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and OS (P = 0.004 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis including age, WBC at presentation, cytogenetics (standard versus high risk) and MRD status at CR, 3 and 6 months, indicated that MRD negative status at CR was an independent predictor of DFS (P < 0.05). Achievement of an MRD negative state assessed by MFC is an important predictor of DFS and OS in adult patients with ALL.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Konoplev, Sergei', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'McCue, Deborah', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Ravandi F', 'Jorgensen JL', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Jabbour E', 'Thomas DA', 'Borthakur G', 'Garris R', 'Huang X', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Burger JA', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda W', 'Kadia T', 'Jain N', 'Wang SA', 'Konoplev S', 'Kebriaei P', 'Champlin RE', 'McCue D', 'Estrov Z', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151022,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13834 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Feb;172(3):392-400. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13834.

Myeloid sarcomas (MS) are rare tumours occurring at extramedullary sites. They are usually associated with other haematology disorders such as acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. They frequently occur with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or with relapse of preexisting disease. Patients with myeloid sarcomas without history or evidence of myeloid leukaemia typically progress to form AML. Case Presentation. A case report of a patient diagnosed with an isolated myeloid sarcoma that rarely did not transform to AML but instead spread to form multiple myeloid sarcomas throughout the body. Discussion. This case identifies the risk of metastatic spread of these tumours rather than the development of AML which is poorly documented in the literature, due to the rarity of cases, and may be significant in the investigation and management of isolated myeloid sarcomas. This case highlights the need for clinicians to consider repeat cross-sectional imaging to investigate unexplained clinical decline or symptoms, when there is no sign of AML progression and to consider radiotherapy treatment early.","['Kohli, Sunita', 'Lee, Mark', 'Marshall, Scott']","['Kohli S', 'Lee M', 'Marshall S']","[""City Hospitals Sunderland and St. Benedict's Hospice, St. Benedict's WayRyhope SR2 0NY, UK"", ""City Hospitals Sunderland and St. Benedict's Hospice, St. Benedict's WayRyhope SR2 0NY, UK"", 'City Hospitals Sunderland, Sunderland Royal Hospital, Kayll Road, Sunderland SR4 7TP, UK']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],20150930,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2015/10/23 06:00,2015/10/23 06:01,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/162154 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2015;2015:162154. doi: 10.1155/2015/162154.

Therefore, in this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify associations of three CYP1A1 polymorphisms (T3801C, A2455G, and C4887A) with the risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Medline, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched to collect relevant studies published up to April 20, 2015. The extracted data were analyzed statistically, and pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify the associations. Overall, 26 publications were included. Finally, T3801C was associated with an increased risk of AML in Asians under the dominant model. For A2455G, the risk of ALL was increased among Caucasians in the recessive model and the allele-contrast model; A2455G was also associated with an increased risk of CML among Caucasians under the recessive model, dominant model, and allele-contrast model.

However, the precise mechanisms by which BCR stimulation leads to accumulation of malignant cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the ability of BCR stimulation to increase messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, which can promote carcinogenesis by effects on both global mRNA translation and upregulated expression of specific oncoproteins. Re-analysis of gene expression profiles revealed striking upregulation of pathways linked to mRNA translation both in CLL cells derived from lymph nodes, the major site of antigen stimulation in vivo, and after BCR stimulation in vitro. Anti-IgM significantly increased mRNA translation in primary CLL cells, measured using bulk metabolic labeling and a novel flow cytometry assay to quantify responses at a single-cell level. These translational responses were suppressed by inhibitors of BTK (ibrutinib) and SYK (tamatinib). Anti-IgM-induced mRNA translation was associated with increased expression of translation initiation factors eIF4A and eIF4GI, and reduced expression of the eIF4A inhibitor, PDCD4. Anti-IgM also increased mRNA translation in normal blood B cells, but without clear modulatory effects on these factors. In addition, anti-IgM increased translation of mRNA-encoding MYC, a major driver of disease progression. mRNA translation is likely to be an important mediator of the growth-promoting effects of antigen stimulation acting, at least in part, via translational induction of MYC. Differences in mechanisms of translational regulation in CLL and normal B cells may provide opportunities for selective therapeutic attack.","['Yeomans, Alison', 'Thirdborough, Stephen M', 'Valle-Argos, Beatriz', 'Linley, Adam', 'Krysov, Sergey', 'Hidalgo, Marina Sanchez', 'Leonard, Elodie', 'Ishfaq, Muhammad', 'Wagner, Simon D', 'Willis, Anne E', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Coldwell, Mark J', 'Packham, Graham']","['Yeomans A', 'Thirdborough SM', 'Valle-Argos B', 'Linley A', 'Krysov S', 'Hidalgo MS', 'Leonard E', 'Ishfaq M', 'Wagner SD', 'Willis AE', 'Steele AJ', 'Stevenson FK', 'Forconi F', 'Coldwell MJ', 'Packham G']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;

While it has been established that tumor-derived cachectic factors can induce myotube wasting, the effect of this catabolic environment on myotube mechanical signaling has not been determined. We investigated whether media containing cachectic factors derived from Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) can regulate the stretch induction of myotube protein synthesis. C2C12 myotubes preincubated in control or LLC-derived media were chronically stretched. Protein synthesis regulation by anabolic and catabolic signaling was then examined. In the control condition, stretch increased mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis. The LLC treatment decreased basal mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis and attenuated the stretch induction of protein synthesis. LLC media increased STAT3 and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in myotubes, independent of stretch. Both stretch and LLC independently increased ERK1/2, p38, and NF-kappaB phosphorylation. In LLC-treated myotubes, the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 rescued the stretch induction of protein synthesis. Interestingly, either leukemia inhibitory factor or glycoprotein 130 antibody administration caused further inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis in stretched myotubes. AMP-activated protein kinase inhibition increased basal mTORC1 signaling activity and protein synthesis in LLC-treated myotubes, but did not restore the stretch induction of protein synthesis. These results demonstrate that LLC-derived cachectic factors can dissociate stretch-induced signaling from protein synthesis through ERK1/2 and p38 signaling, and that glycoprotein 130 signaling is associated with the basal stretch response in myotubes.","['Gao, Song', 'Carson, James A']","['Gao S', 'Carson JA']","['Integrative Muscle Biology Laboratory, Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina; and.', 'Integrative Muscle Biology Laboratory, Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina; and Center for Colon Cancer Research, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina carsonj@mailbox.sc.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151021,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Cells of the osteoblast lineage that reside in the endosteal niche have been implicated in promoting survival of AML cells. Here, we investigated how to prevent this protective interaction. We previously showed that SDF-1, a chemokine abundant in the bone marrow, induces apoptosis of AML cells, unless the leukemic cells receive protective signals provided by differentiating osteoblasts (8, 10). We now identify a novel signaling pathway in differentiating osteoblasts that can be manipulated to disrupt the osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells. Treating differentiating osteoblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) abrogated their ability to protect co-cultured AML cells from SDF-1-induced apoptosis. HDACi prominently up-regulated expression of the Nherf1 scaffold protein, which played a major role in preventing osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells. Protein phosphatase-1alpha (PP1alpha) was identified as a novel Nherf1 interacting protein that acts as the downstream mediator of this response by promoting nuclear localization of the TAZ transcriptional modulator. Moreover, independent activation of either PP1alpha or TAZ was sufficient to prevent osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells even in the absence of HDACi. Together, these results indicate that HDACi target the AML microenvironment by enhancing activation of the Nherf1-PP1alpha-TAZ pathway in osteoblasts. Selective drug targeting of this osteoblast signaling pathway may improve treatments of AML by rendering leukemic cells in the bone marrow more susceptible to apoptosis.","['Kremer, Kimberly N', 'Dudakovic, Amel', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Westendorf, Jennifer J', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Hedin, Karen E']","['Kremer KN', 'Dudakovic A', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Westendorf JJ', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Hedin KE']","['From the Departments of Immunology.', 'Orthopedic Surgery.', 'the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21287.', 'the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21287.', 'the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21287.', 'Oncology and Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics and.', 'Orthopedic Surgery, the Center of Regenerative Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905 and.', 'Orthopedic Surgery, the Center of Regenerative Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905 and.', 'From the Departments of Immunology, hedin.karen@mayo.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151021,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins)', '0 (WWTR1 protein, human)', '0 (sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/04/20 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)39561-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.668160 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Dec 4;290(49):29478-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.668160.

Also, CLL cells have been shown to express CTLA-4, increased levels of which in the leukaemic compartment are a predictor of good clinical outcome. Since both CLL and Treg microenvironment cells can be targeted by the CTLA-4 blocking antibody in this immunotherapy approach, the investigation of the functional effect of CTLA-4 blockade on CLL cells might be of potential clinical relevance. The main aim of this study was to examine the effect of CTLA-4 blockade on proliferation activity and apoptosis of CLL cells in patients with low and high CTLA-4 expression. We found that in the high CTLA-4-expressing CLL group, CTLA-4 blockade on the CLL cell surface resulted in a significant increase in the median percentages of Ki67(+) cells and a tendency to decrease in the proportion of apoptotic cells. In contrast, in the low CTLA-4 expressors, CTLA-4 blockade did not affect the proliferation activity or the frequency of apoptosis. This study reports for the first time the different effect of CTLA-4 blockade on CLL cells in CLL patients depending on the levels of CTLA-4 expression. CTLA-4 blockade seems to induce pro-survival signals in leukaemic cells from CLL patients exhibiting high CTLA-4 expression, suggesting that an immunotherapy approach based on the systemic use of monoclonal anti-CTLA-4 antibodies could be an unfavourable strategy for some CLL patients.","['Ciszak, Lidia', 'Frydecka, Irena', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Szteblich, Aleksandra', 'Kosmaczewska, Agata']","['Ciszak L', 'Frydecka I', 'Wolowiec D', 'Szteblich A', 'Kosmaczewska A']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, Department of Experimental Therapy, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, R.

Maspin, which is also known as mammary serine protease inhibitor, has been suggested to be a valuable focus for targeted cancer therapy. Specifically, maspin has been shown to be upregulated after androgen ablation therapy. Gemcitabine is used as a first-line therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, but its disease control rate is low. Furthermore, the role of maspin in the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine for HIPC remains unclear. The expression levels of maspin in PC-3 and DU145 cells were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Furthermore, the expression of maspin was silenced using shRNA technology to generate maspin-KD cells. The cytotoxicity of gemcitabine to prostate cancer cells was assessed using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-3,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, whereas flow cytometry analyses and annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assays were used to assess the ability of gemcitabine to induce apoptosis in maspin-KD and control cells. Additionally, the expression patterns of anti-apoptosis proteins (myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)) and pro-apoptosis proteins (Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)) were determined by Western blotting. In this study, PC-3 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine administration than DU145 cells, which correlated with the higher expression levels of maspin observed in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, maspin knockdown enhanced gemcitabine-induced cell death, as evidenced by the increased number of apoptotic cells. Gemcitabine treatment upregulated the levels of anti-apoptosis proteins (Mcl-2 and Bcl-2) in both scrambled control and maspin-KD cells; however, the fold changes in Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression were larger in gemcitabine-treated scrambled control cells than in maspin-KD cells. Finally, our findings indicate for the first time that maspin may mediate the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in HIPC. Our results demonstrate that maspin knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to gemcitabine. Therefore, combining gemcitabine with a drug that targets maspin might constitute a valuable strategy for prostate cancer treatment.","['Huang, Chien-Yu', 'Chang, Yu-Jia', 'Luo, Sheng-Dean', 'Uyanga, Batzorig', 'Lin, Feng-Yen', 'Tai, Cheng-Jeng', 'Huang, Ming-Te']","['Huang CY', 'Chang YJ', 'Luo SD', 'Uyanga B', 'Lin FY', 'Tai CJ', 'Huang MT']","['Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. cjtai@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. cjtai@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mthuant@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mthuant@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mthuant@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. mthuant@tmu.edu.tw.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151021,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (SERPIN-B5)', '0 (Serpins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Serpins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/10/23 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4083-x [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4083-x [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Mar;37(3):4075-82. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4083-x.

To account for this balance during activation of T cells, we used metabolic labeling to quantify the contributions of RNA transcription and decay over a 4 h time course during activation of leukemia-derived Jurkat T cells. While prior studies suggested more than half of the changes in mRNA abundance were due to RNA stability, we found a smaller but more interesting population of mRNAs changed stability. These mRNAs clustered into functionally related subpopulations that included replicative histones, ribosomal biogenesis and cell motility functions. We then applied a novel analysis based on integrating global protein-RNA binding with concurrent changes in RNA stability at specific time points following activation. This analysis demonstrated robust stabilization of mRNAs by the HuR RNA-binding protein 4 h after activation. Our unexpected findings demonstrate that the temporal regulation of mRNA stability coordinates vital cellular pathways and is in part controlled by the HuR RNA binding protein in Jurkat T cells following activation.","['Blackinton, Jeff G', 'Keene, Jack D']","['Blackinton JG', 'Keene JD']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA jack.keene@dm.duke.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20151020,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ELAV-Like Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics/immunology', '*RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['gkv1066 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkv1066 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jan 8;44(1):426-36. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv1066.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are a characteristic feature of AML. GATA4 has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene regulated by promoter hypermethylation in various types of human cancers although the expression and promoter methylation of GATA4 in pediatric AML is still unclear. METHODS: Transcriptional expression levels of GATA4 were evaluated by semi-quantitative and real-time PCR. Methylation status was investigated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfate genomic sequencing (BGS). The prognostic significance of GATA4 expression and promoter methylation was assessed in 105 cases of Chinese pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients with clinical follow-up records. RESULTS: MSP and BGS analysis showed that the GATA4 gene promoter is hypermethylated in AML cells, such as the HL-60 and MV4-11 human myeloid leukemia cell lines. 5-Aza treatment significantly upregulated GATA4 expression in HL-60 and MV4-11 cells. Aberrant methylation of GATA4 was observed in 15.0 % (3/20) of the normal bone marrow control samples compared to 56.2 % (59/105) of the pediatric AML samples. GATA4 transcript levels were significantly decreased in AML patients (33.06 +/- 70.94; P = 0.011) compared to normal bone marrow/idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura controls (116.76 +/- 105.39). GATA4 promoter methylation was correlated with patient leukocyte counts (WBC, white blood cells) (P = 0.035) and minimal residual disease MRD (P = 0.031). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed significantly shorter overall survival time in patients with GATA4 promoter methylation (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic inactivation of GATA4 by promoter hypermethylation was observed in both AML cell lines and pediatric AML samples; our study implicates GATA4 as a putative tumor suppressor gene in pediatric AML. In addition, our findings imply that GATA4 promoter methylation is correlated with WBC and MRD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed significantly shorter overall survival in pediatric AML with GATA4 promoter methylation but multivariate analysis shows that it is not an independent factor. However, further research focusing on the mechanism of GATA4 in pediatric leukemia is required.","['Tao, Yan-Fang', 'Fang, Fang', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Lu, Jun', 'Cao, Lan', 'Zhao, Wen-Li', 'Xiao, Pei-Fang', 'Li, Zhi-Heng', 'Wang, Na-Na', 'Xu, Li-Xiao', 'Du, Xiao-Juan', 'Sun, Li-Chao', 'Li, Yan-Hong', 'Li, Yi-Ping', 'Xu, Yun-Yun', 'Ni, Jian', 'Wang, Jian', 'Feng, Xing', 'Pan, Jian']","['Tao YF', 'Fang F', 'Hu SY', 'Lu J', 'Cao L', 'Zhao WL', 'Xiao PF', 'Li ZH', 'Wang NN', 'Xu LX', 'Du XJ', 'Sun LC', 'Li YH', 'Li YP', 'Xu YY', 'Ni J', 'Wang J', 'Feng X', 'Pan J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. taoyanfang1982@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. baseff77@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. hsy139@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. drlujun_sz@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. cl2012@sohu.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. wenlizhao69@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. xiaopfdr@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. szlizhiheng@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. 570843000@qq.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. xulixiao2013@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, the 5th Hospital of Chinese PLA, Yin chuan, China. du_xiaojuan123@163.com.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Cancer Institute (Hospital), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China. sunlichao_1980@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. lyh072006@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. ray8302880@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. rdxyy@163.com.', 'Translational Research Center, Second Hospital, The Second Clinical School, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. ni_jian2008@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. wj196312@vip.163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. xing_feng66@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Childrens Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. panjian2008@163.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151021,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/06/30 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1760-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1760-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Oct 21;15:756. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1760-5.,,PMC4618362,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, expandable primitive NSCs are required for research and for the development of therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases. There is a dearth of suitable techniques for the generation of human long-term expandable primitive NSCs. Here, we have described a method for the conversion of human fibroblasts to LIF-dependent primitive NSCs using a strategy based on techniques for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These LIF-dependent induced NSCs (LD-iNSCs) can be expanded for >100 passages. Long-term cultured LD-iNSCs demonstrated multipotent neural differentiation potential and could generate motor neurons and dopaminergic neurons, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating a high level of plasticity. Furthermore, LD-iNSCs easily reverted to human iPSCs, indicating that LD-iNSCs are in an intermediate iPSC state. This method may facilitate the generation of patient-specific human neurons for studies and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","['Miura, Takumi', 'Sugawara, Tohru', 'Fukuda, Atsushi', 'Tamoto, Ryo', 'Kawasaki, Tomoyuki', 'Umezawa, Akihiro', 'Akutsu, Hidenori']","['Miura T', 'Sugawara T', 'Fukuda A', 'Tamoto R', 'Kawasaki T', 'Umezawa A', 'Akutsu H']","['Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan miura-t@nihs.go.jp akutsu-h@ncchd.go.jp.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan Department of Stem Cell Research, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan miura-t@nihs.go.jp akutsu-h@ncchd.go.jp.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151021,England,Biol Open,Biology open,101578018,,,,2015/10/23 06:00,2015/10/23 06:01,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['bio.013151 [pii]', '10.1242/bio.013151 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Open. 2015 Oct 21;4(11):1595-607. doi: 10.1242/bio.013151.,,PMC4728346,,['(c) 2015.

Although mTOR is already an attractive antineoplastic target, overexpression or aberrant expression of mTOR may also provide an opportunity to further increase the size differential between malignant and normal cells, providing an opportunity to amplify and exploit cell size differences between neoplastic cells and their normal counterparts using physiochemical treatment modalities. Therefore, this study sought to quantify the concentration response and time course effects of rapamycin on cell cycle entry, cell enlargement, and cell proliferation in U937 human monocytic leukemia and human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs). In addition, the effects of combination treatment with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, everolimus, and temsirolimus) and cytoskeletal-directed agents (cytochalasin B and vincristine) in leukemic cells (U937, THP1, K562, Molt-4, and L1210) were assessed for potential drug synergy. While both U937 cells and hHSCs exhibited a marked reduction in cell volume, U937 cells were able to proliferate in the presence of rapamycin ranging from 0.5 nM to 10 muM (10,000 nM), whereas hHSCs were able to proliferate only at lower concentrations, and were completely inhibited from proliferation by 8 nM rapamycin. These effects were observed with as little as 0.5 nM rapamycin, demonstrating the profound affinity the compound has for FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), which subsequently forms the FKBP12/rapamycin complex to inhibit mTOR. Rapamycin continued to exert effects on cell size and proliferation even at 10 muM, without producing marked cytotoxicity. Although cytochalasin B and vincristine were unable to substantially enlarge rapamycin-treated leukemia cells, it appears that rapamycin and its associated analogs everolimus and temsirolimus have notable synergistic potential with microfilament-disrupting cytochalasin B and microtubule-disrupting vincristine as assessed by comparative effects on cell growth, annexin V staining, IC30 isobolograms, and Chou-Talalay statistics. These observations indicate a potentially novel therapeutic rationale for hematological malignancies and for other cancers to elicit the preferential destruction of neoplastic cells that aberrantly express mTOR.","['Trendowski, Matthew', 'Christen, Timothy D', 'Andonova, Antoaneta A', 'Narampanawe, Berlini', 'Thibaud, Ashlee', 'Kusang, Tenzin', 'Fondy, Thomas P']","['Trendowski M', 'Christen TD', 'Andonova AA', 'Narampanawe B', 'Thibaud A', 'Kusang T', 'Fondy TP']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA. mrtrendo@syr.edu.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151022,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Size', 'Cytoskeleton/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sirolimus/*administration & dosage', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'U937 Cells']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/09/13 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10637-015-0294-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-015-0294-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2015 Dec;33(6):1162-74. doi: 10.1007/s10637-015-0294-7.

We describe the case of a 28-year-old man diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes harboring a normal karyotype. This patient underwent 2 courses of idarubicin and cytosine arabinose therapy, and 3 courses of high-dose cytosine arabinose therapy. Subsequently, he underwent high-dose chemotherapy (total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide) followed by first CBT. Primary GF occurred after post-immunological reaction and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and was diagnosed on day 27 after the first CBT. Therefore, the patient underwent secondary CBT for GF treated with a modified one-day conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2), 3 days), cyclophosphamide (2 g/m(2)), and total body irradiation (2 Gy), and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisting of mycophenolate and tacrolimus.

During the clinical course of the second CBT, the main complications were sepsis, BK virus-associated cystitis, and acute graft-versus-host disease (skin, grade 2, stage 3). After these treatments, the patient was disease-free for 39 months. Our case suggests that these treatments may be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of patients with GF. This case study may be helpful to physicians who directly care for GF patients, and may provide a future direction for a more efficient treatment modality.","['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Shimizu, Ikuo', 'Kobayashi, Hikaru', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Ueda, Akira', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo']","['Kawano N', 'Kuriyama T', 'Yoshida S', 'Shimizu I', 'Kobayashi H', 'Takenaka K', 'Uchida N', 'Takami A', 'Yamashita K', 'Ueda A', 'Kikuchi I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Graft Rejection/*therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Tacrolimus/*administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3960/jslrt.55.89 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2015;55(2):89-96. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.55.89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We encountered a unique APL patient who presented with persistent hypoplastic features of APL. An 84-year-old man presented with leukopenia (2.2 x 10(9)/L) and anemia (Hb 12.5 g/dL). Five months later, the bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic with a normal proportion of blasts and promyelocytes (5.2%), although the latter cells were hypergranular. The karyotype of BM cells was 46, XY, t(15;17)(q22;q12), t(9;11)(q13;p13). Two months later, the BM remained hypoplastic with 8.5% hypergranular promyelocytes, some of which contained faggot of Auer rods. RT-PCR examination yielded the PML-RARalpha transcript, and its sequencing revealed the breakpoint of PML to be bcr2. The patient was treated with all-trans retinoic acid under a diagnosis of APL with improvement of the bicytopenia. FISH analysis of BM cells yielded a negative result regarding t(15;17), although RT-PCR was positive for PML-RARalpha mRNA. Six months later, APL recurred with the same karyotypic abnormalities and therapeutic resistance, and the patient died of pneumonia.

Identification of osteolytic lesions by this technique has recently been incorporated into the updated International Myeloma Working Group criteria for MM diagnosis. However, no data are available regarding the impact of focal lesions (FLs) without underlying osteolysis on time to progression (TTP) to MM. We hence prospectively studied a cohort of 120 SMM patients with PET/CT. PET/CT was positive in 16% of patients (1 FL: 8, 2 FLs: 3, >3 FLs: 6, diffuse bone marrow involvement: 2). With a median follow-up of 2.2 years, 38% of patients progressed to MM, in a median time of 4 years, including 21% with skeletal involvement. The risk of progression of those with positive PET/CT was 3.00 (95% confidence interval 1.58-5.69, P=0.001), with a median TTP of 1.1 versus 4.5 years for PET/CT-negative patients. The probability of progression within 2 years was 58% for positive versus 33% for negative patients. In conclusion, PET/CT positivity significantly increased the risk of progression of SMM to MM.

Inhibition of NF-kappaB has been shown to induce apoptosis in AML cells, but the clinical effectiveness of NF-kappaB inhibitors has been inadequate. In recent years, possible causes underlying this continuous NF-kappaB activity have been elucidated. It has been shown that chromosomal translocations or mutations leading to development of leukemia drive the increase in NF-kappaB activity. Furthermore, autocrine/paracrine cytokine signaling and increased expression of NF-kappaB signaling components play an important role in the continuous NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, high proteasome activity, which positively regulates NF-kappaB activity, is often observed in AML patients. In the present study, we described these underlying molecular mechanisms leading to constitutive NF-kappaB activity and discussed the novel treatment strategies based on the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.","['Bosman, Matthieu Cornelis Johannes', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Bosman MC', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ, Groningen, The Netherlands.

In patients with ET a positive correlation was observed between JAK-2 V617F mutation, that facilitates erythropoietin receptor signalling, and thrombotic events, although the mechanism involved is not clear. We previously demonstrated that heparanase protein forms a complex and enhances the activity of the blood coagulation initiator tissue factor (TF) which leads to increased factor Xa production and subsequent activation of the coagulation system. The present study was aimed to evaluate heparanase procoagulant activity in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Forty bone marrow biopsies of patients with ET, PV, PMF and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) were immunostained to heparanase, TF and TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Erythropoietin receptor positive cell lines U87 human glioma and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma were studied. Heparanase and TFPI staining were more prominent in ET, PV and PMF compared to CML. The strongest staining was in JAK-2 positive ET biopsies. Heparanase level and procoagulant activity were higher in U87 cells transfected to over express JAK-2 V617F mutation compared to control and the effect was reversed using JAK-2 inhibitors (Ruxolitinib, VZ3) and hydroxyurea, although the latter drug did not inhibit JAK-2 phosphorylation. Erythropoietin increased while JAK-2 inhibitors decreased the heparanase level and procoagulant activity in U87 and MCF-7 parental cells. In conclusion, JAK-2 is involved in heparanase up-regulation via the erythropoietin receptor. The present findings may potentially point to a new mechanism of thrombosis in JAK-2 positive ET patients.","['Kogan, Inna', 'Chap, Dafna', 'Hoffman, Ron', 'Axelman, Elena', 'Brenner, Benjamin', 'Nadir, Yona']","['Kogan I', 'Chap D', 'Hoffman R', 'Axelman E', 'Brenner B', 'Nadir Y']","['Yona Nadir, MD, PhD, Thrombosis and Hemostasis Unit,, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, Tel.: +972 4 8453520, Fax: +972 4 8543886, E-mail: ynadir@netvision.net.il.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151022,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucuronidase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lipoproteins/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2015/10/23 06:00,2016/09/27 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['15-04-0320 [pii]', '10.1160/TH15-04-0320 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2016 Jan;115(1):73-80. doi: 10.1160/TH15-04-0320.

In contrast, Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma is a mature B lymphocyte neoplasm with a characteristic germinal center immunophenotype and MYC rearrangement. With modern immunophenotyping and cytogenetic methods, the distinction between these 2 entities is seldom ambiguous. Herein, we report a case of a 9-year-old white boy with circulating leukemic cells that demonstrate morphologic overlap between Burkitt leukemia and B lymphoblastic leukemia. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical stains demonstrated expression of sets of markers with overlap between immature and mature immunophenotypes. While the leukemic cells tested positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), they expressed CD20, BCL6 (in a subset), and lambda-restricted surface light chain. Molecular studies confirmed a true clonal light chain rearrangement, whereas fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) results were negative for MYC rearrangement.

However, the mechanisms of aGVHD are not well understood. We aim to investigate the roles of the three angiogenic factors: angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Ang-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the development of aGVHD. Twenty-one patients who underwent allo-HSCT were included in our study. The dynamic changes of Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF were monitored in patients before and after allo-HSCT. In vitro, endothelial cells (ECs) were treated with TNF-beta in the presence or absence of Ang-1, and then the Ang-2 level in the cell culture medium and the tubule formation by ECs were evaluated. After allo-HSCT, Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF all exhibited significant variation, suggesting these factors might be involved in the endothelial damage in transplantation. Patients with aGVHD had lower Ang-1 level at day 7 but higher Ang-2 level at day 21 than those without aGVHD, implying that Ang-1 may play a protective role in early phase yet Ang-2 is a promotion factor to aGVHD. In vitro, TNF-beta promoted the release of Ang-2 by ECs and impaired tubule formation of ECs, which were both weakened by Ang-1, suggesting that Ang-1 may play a protective role in aGVHD by influencing the secretion of Ang-2, consistent with our in vivo tests. It is concluded that monitoring changes of these factors following allo-HSCT might help to identify patients at a high risk for aGVHD.","['Nie, Di-Min', 'Wu, Qiu-Ling', 'Zhu, Xia-Xia', 'Zhang, Ran', 'Zheng, Peng', 'Fang, Jun', 'You, Yong', 'Zhong, Zhao-Dong', 'Xia, Ling-Hui', 'Hong, Mei']","['Nie DM', 'Wu QL', 'Zhu XX', 'Zhang R', 'Zheng P', 'Fang J', 'You Y', 'Zhong ZD', 'Xia LH', 'Hong M']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. meihongcncn@aliyun.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151022,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Since all Angs are able to bind to Tie-2 but none binds to Tie-1, the function of Tie-2 and its ligands have captured attention. However, emerging evidence indicates unique roles of the orphan receptor Tie-1 in angiogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions. It is required for maintaining vascular endothelial cell integrity and survival during murine embryo development and in adult and may be involved in modulating differentiation of hematopoietic cells in adult. Tie-1 exhibits poor tyrosine kinase activity and signals via forming heterodimers with Tie-2, inhibiting Tie-2 signaling mediated by Angs. This inhibition can be relieved by Tie-1 ectodomain cleavage mediated by tumor- and inflammatory-related factors, which causes destabilization of vessels and initiates vessel remodeling. Up-regulated Tie-1 expression has been found not only in some leukemia cells and tumor related endothelial cells but also in cytoplasm of carcinoma cells of a variety of human solid tumors, which is associated with tumor progression. In addition, it has pro-inflammatory functions in endothelial cells and is involved in some inflammatory diseases associated with angiogenesis. Recent research indicated that Tie-1 gene ablation exhibited significant effects on tumor blood- and lymph-angiogenesis and improved anti-Ang therapy, suggesting Tie-1 may be a potential target for tumor anti-angiogenesis treatment.","['Yang, Ping', 'Chen, Na', 'Jia, Jing-Hui', 'Gao, Xue-Jiao', 'Li, Shi-Han', 'Cai, Jing', 'Wang, Zehua']","['Yang P', 'Chen N', 'Jia JH', 'Gao XJ', 'Li SH', 'Cai J', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832008, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. caijingmmm@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. zehuawang@163.net.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20151022,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Unfortunately, clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have until recently focused mainly on the subgroup of younger patients in good overall condition ('go- go' patients). Clinico- biological parameters, such as performance status, calculated creatinine clearance, the number and severity of comorbidities along with individual clinical assessment can help guide decisions relating to the objectives and ultimately the intensity of treatment. Two large randomized studies have recently demonstrated that the addition of monoclonal antibodies against CD20 (obinutuzumab, rituximab and ofatumumab) to chlorambucil in untreated 'slow- go' patients resulted in a significant increase in the number of complete remissions, progression-free survival and even overall survival (for obinutuzumab and rituximab) with an acceptable safety profile. Chemoimmunotherapy combining chlorambucil with anti-CD20 antibody is thus the new standard 1st line therapy in this group of patients. Treatment of relapsed/ refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 'slow- go' patients is very difficult and specific data is sparse. In this indication, we have witnessed an extraordinary breakthrough by means of small oral inhibitors interfering with B -cell receptor downstream signaling pathways: ibrutinib, the Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and idelalisib, the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase delta. Both drugs radically changed the approach to the treatment of relapsed/ refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; relatively mild toxicity also predetermines their use in elderly/ comorbid patients. Other treatment options for relapsed/ refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia in this subgroup include alemtuzumab, ofatumumab, high-dose glucocorticoids + anti-CD20 antibodies, or bendamustine + rituximab regimen. This review summarizes current data regarding the treatment of elderly and comorbid patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Smolej, L']",['Smolej L'],,,['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use']",2015/10/23 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['56099 [pii]', '10.14735/amko20153s30 [doi]']",ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2015;28 Suppl 3:3S30-8. doi: 10.14735/amko20153s30.,,,,,,,,,,,,Lecebne moznosti pro nemocne s chronickou lymfocytarni leukemii a vyznamnymi pridruzenymi chorobami.,,,,,,,,,

Biologically relevant populations of primary human bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts and human leukemic cells representative of an aggressive phenotype were encapsulated in 3-D collagen matrix as the minimal constituents and cultured in a microfluidic platform. The matrix stiffness and fluidic shear stress were controlled in a physiological range. The 3-D microfluidic as well as 3-D static models demonstrated coordinated cell-cell interactions between these cell types compared to the compaction of the 2-D static model. Tumor cell viability in response to an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent, cytarabine in tumor cells alone and tri-culture models for 2-D static, 3-D static and 3-D microfluidic models were compared. The present study showed decreased chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity of leukemic cells in 3-D tri-culture models from the 2-D models. The results indicate that the bone marrow microenvironment plays a protective role in tumor cell survival during drug treatment. The engineered 3-D microfluidic tri-culture model enables systematic investigation of effects of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions on cancer progression and therapeutic intervention in a controllable manner, thus improving our limited comprehension of the role of microenvironmental signals in cancer biology.","['Bruce, Allison', 'Evans, Rebecca', 'Mezan, Ryan', 'Shi, Lin', 'Moses, Blake S', 'Martin, Karen H', 'Gibson, Laura F', 'Yang, Yong']","['Bruce A', 'Evans R', 'Mezan R', 'Shi L', 'Moses BS', 'Martin KH', 'Gibson LF', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, United States of America.', 'Alexander B.

The spliceosome inhibitor spliceostatin A (SSA) is known to regulate Mcl-1 and so here we assessed the ability of SSA to elicit apoptosis in CLL. SSA induced apoptosis of CLL cells at low nanomolar concentrations in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but independently of SF3B1 mutational status, IGHV status and CD38 or ZAP70 expression. However, normal B and T cells were less sensitive than CLL cells (P=0.006 and P<0.001, respectively). SSA altered the splicing of anti-apoptotic MCL-1(L) to MCL-1(s) in CLL cells coincident with induction of apoptosis. Overexpression studies in Ramos cells suggested that Mcl-1 was important for SSA-induced killing since its expression inversely correlated with apoptosis (P=0.001). IL4 and CD40L, present in patient lymph nodes, are known to protect tumour cells from apoptosis and significantly inhibited SSA, ABT-263 and ABT-199 induced killing following administration to CLL cells (P=0.008). However, by combining SSA with the Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) antagonists ABT-263 or ABT-199, we were able to overcome this pro-survival effect. We conclude that SSA combined with Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) antagonists may have therapeutic utility for CLL.","['Larrayoz, M', 'Blakemore, S J', 'Dobson, R C', 'Blunt, M D', 'Rose-Zerilli, M J J', 'Walewska, R', 'Duncombe, A', 'Oscier, D', 'Koide, K', 'Forconi, F', 'Packham, G', 'Yoshida, M', 'Cragg, M S', 'Strefford, J C', 'Steele, A J']","['Larrayoz M', 'Blakemore SJ', 'Dobson RC', 'Blunt MD', 'Rose-Zerilli MJ', 'Walewska R', 'Duncombe A', 'Oscier D', 'Koide K', 'Forconi F', 'Packham G', 'Yoshida M', 'Cragg MS', 'Strefford JC', 'Steele AJ']","['Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK, NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Chemical Genomics Research Group, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Wako, Japan.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151021,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (spliceostatin A)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",2015/10/22 06:00,2016/07/23 06:00,['2015/10/22 06:00'],"['2015/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015286 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.286 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Feb;30(2):351-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.286.

METHODS: LightCycler melting curve analysis was applied to detect risk alleles of TERT rs2736100_C and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) rs12343867_C tagging 46/1 haplotype in 584 BCR-ABL1-negative MPN, 308 acute, and 86 chronic myeloid leukemia (AML and CML) patients and 400 healthy individuals. RESULTS: TERT rs2736100_C showed an increased allele frequency in BCR-ABL1-negative MPN patients compared with controls (62.7%+/-2.8% vs. 48.8%+/-3.5%, P < 0.0001) regardless of molecular background or disease type, but not in CML or AML. Combined TERT and JAK2 hetero- or homozygosity conferred even higher risk for classic MPN. Common complications (thrombosis, myelofibrosis, or leukemia) were not associated with the TERT variant; however, adverse survival was noted in TERT variant carrier polycythemia vera patients. MPN patients with the TERT CC genotype had a higher probability (44.4%) to die from solid tumors compared with TERT AC/AA individuals (5.3%; P = 0.004). TERT rs2736100_C carriers had increased risk of solid tumors independently from cytoreductive treatment [3.08 (1.03-9.26), P = 0.045]. CONCLUSIONS: TERT rs2736100_C polymorphism predisposes to the development of BCR-ABL1-negative MPN with the co-occurrence of solid tumors, especially with the usage of cytoreductive treatment. IMPACT: The high frequency of TERT variant in the classic MPN population highlights the importance of the avoidance of long-term cytoreductive treatment in MPN patients.","['Krahling, Tunde', 'Balassa, Katalin', 'Kiss, Katalin Piroska', 'Bors, Andras', 'Batai, Arpad', 'Halm, Gabriella', 'Egyed, Miklos', 'Fekete, Sandor', 'Remenyi, Peter', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Tordai, Attila', 'Andrikovics, Hajnalka']","['Krahling T', 'Balassa K', 'Kiss KP', 'Bors A', 'Batai A', 'Halm G', 'Egyed M', 'Fekete S', 'Remenyi P', 'Masszi T', 'Tordai A', 'Andrikovics H']","['Semmelweis University, Doctoral School, Budapest, Hungary.

Recently, we discovered a phenomenon that we call ""receptor pleiotropism"" in which agonist antibodies against known receptors induce cell fates that are very different from those induced by the natural agonist to the same receptor. Here, we show that one can take advantage of this phenomenon to convert acute myeloblastic leukemic cells into natural killer cells. Upon induction with the antibody, these leukemic cells enter into a differentiation cascade in which as many as 80% of the starting leukemic cells can be differentiated. The antibody-induced killer cells make large amounts of perforin, IFN-gamma, and granzyme B and attack and kill other members of the leukemic cell population. Importantly, induction of killer cells is confined to transformed cells, in that normal bone marrow cells are not induced to form killer cells. Thus, it seems possible to use agonist antibodies to change the differentiation state of cancer cells into those that attack and kill other members of the malignant clone from which they originate.","['Yea, Kyungmoo', 'Zhang, Hongkai', 'Xie, Jia', 'Jones, Teresa M', 'Lin, Chih-Wei', 'Francesconi, Walter', 'Berton, Fulvia', 'Fallahi, Mohammad', 'Sauer, Karsten', 'Lerner, Richard A']","['Yea K', 'Zhang H', 'Xie J', 'Jones TM', 'Lin CW', 'Francesconi W', 'Berton F', 'Fallahi M', 'Sauer K', 'Lerner RA']","['Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunological Studies, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 200031, China;', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Department of Chemical Physiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'BioInformatics Core, The Scripps Research Institute, Scripps Florida, Jupiter, FL 33458;', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037; Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037; rlerner@scripps.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151020,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods/trends', 'Computational Biology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Perforin/metabolism']",2015/10/22 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2015/10/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1519079112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1519079112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Nov 10;112(45):E6158-65. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1519079112.

METHODS: In this cohort study, 308,297 workers in the nuclear industry from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States with detailed monitoring data for external exposure to ionising radiation were linked to death registries. Excess relative rate per Gy of radiation dose for mortality from cancer was estimated. Follow-up encompassed 8.2 million person years. Of 66,632 known deaths by the end of follow-up, 17,957 were due to solid cancers. STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS: Results suggest a linear increase in the rate of cancer with increasing radiation exposure. The average cumulative colon dose estimated among exposed workers was 20.9 mGy (median 4.1 mGy). The estimated rate of mortality from all cancers excluding leukaemia increased with cumulative dose by 48% per Gy (90% confidence interval 20% to 79%), lagged by 10 years. Similar associations were seen for mortality from all solid cancers (47% (18% to 79%)), and within each country. The estimated association over the dose range of 0-100 mGy was similar in magnitude to that obtained over the entire dose range but less precise. Smoking and occupational asbestos exposure are potential confounders; however, exclusion of deaths from lung cancer and pleural cancer did not affect the estimated association. Despite substantial efforts to characterise the performance of the radiation dosimeters used, the possibility of measurement error remains. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The study provides a direct estimate of the association between protracted low dose exposure to ionising radiation and solid cancer mortality. Although high dose rate exposures are thought to be more dangerous than low dose rate exposures, the risk per unit of radiation dose for cancer among radiation workers was similar to estimates derived from studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Quantifying the cancer risks associated with protracted radiation exposures can help strengthen the foundation for radiation protection standards.

METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we retrospectively quantified MEF2C expression in pretreatment bone marrow specimens in participants of the AAML0531 trial by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and correlated expression levels with disease characteristics and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In all 751 available patient specimens, MEF2C messenger RNA (mRNA) was detectable and varied >3000-fold relative to beta-glucuronidase. Patients with the highest relative MEF2C expression (4th quartile) less likely achieved a complete remission after one course of chemotherapy than the other patients (67 vs. 78 %, P = 0.005). They also had an inferior overall survival (P = 0.014; at 5 years 55 +/- 8 vs. 67 +/- 4 %), inferior event-free survival (P < 0.001; at 5 years 38 +/- 7 vs. 54 +/- 4 %), and higher relapse risk than patients within the lower 3 quartiles of MEF2C expression (P < 0.001; at 5 years 53 +/- 9 vs. 35 +/- 5 %). These differences were accounted for by lower prevalence of cytogenetically/molecularly defined low-risk disease (16 vs. 46 %, P < 0.001) and higher prevalence of standard-risk disease (68 vs. 42 %, P < 0.001) in patients with high MEF2C expression, suggesting that MEF2C cooperates with additional pathogenic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: High MEF2C expression identifies a subset of AML patients with adverse-risk disease features and poor outcome. With confirmation that high MEF2C mRNA expression leads to overexpression of MEF2C protein, these findings provide the rationale for therapeutic targeting of MEF2C transcriptional activation in AML.","['Laszlo, George S', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gudgeon, Chelsea J', 'Harrington, Kimberly H', 'Kentsis, Alex', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Laszlo GS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gudgeon CJ', 'Harrington KH', 'Kentsis A', 'Gerbing RB', 'Wang YC', 'Ries RE', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S', 'Walter RB']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, MO, USA."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. rwalter@fredhutch.org.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20151020,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2C protein, human)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/10/22 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/10/22 06:00'],"['2015/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0215-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0215-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Oct 20;8:115. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0215-4.,"['U10-CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA161894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD020069/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA161894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4618184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Nov 30;9(1):133.

Brain hemorrhage and strokes due to meningitis, leukemia, or other malignancy were excluded. In four, no cause was found. Three were related to trauma that preceded the stroke by up to 24 h. Two were due to cardiac emboli, which occurred during cardiac catheterization for dilation of stenotic valves, and two occurred spontaneously in association with mitral valve prolapse. One stroke was related to an inapparent neurocutaneous syndrome, and one was related to a hyperlipidemia. Follow-up showed no recurrence. School performance and developmental assessment was normal in 11 of 13 (one had a learning disability and the other had hyperactivity). Mild motor deficits persisted in five, were moderate in two, and were severe in one. The overall prognosis was best in children under 5 years.","['Kalapurackal, M', 'Shuaib, A', 'Lowry, N J']","['Kalapurackal M', 'Shuaib A', 'Lowry NJ']","['From the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100611,United States,J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,9111633,,,,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['2015/10/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S1052-3057(10)80148-X [pii]', '10.1016/S1052-3057(10)80148-X [doi]']",ppublish,J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis. 1994;4(1):57-62. doi: 10.1016/S1052-3057(10)80148-X.

Many TFs and miRNAs were separately studied in the development of B and T cells. In this study, we aim to discover the TF and miRNA co-regulation and identify key regulators in the B and T cells maturation. We obtained the candidate genes, miRNAs and TFs for each stage of their maturation, then constructed the TF-miRNA-gene feed-forward loops (FFLs) for each stage by our previous methods. Statistical test for FFLs indicated their enrichment and significance. TF-miRNA co-regulatory networks for each stage were constructed by combining their FFLs. Hub analysis revealed the key regulators in each stage, for example, MYC, STAT5A, PAX5 and miR-17 ~ 92 in the transition of pro-B cells into pre-B cells. We also identified a few common regulators and modules in two stages of B cell maturation (e.g. miR-146a/NFKB1/BCL11A) and two stages of T cell maturation (e.g. miR-20/CCND2/SORL1), as well as some shared regulators in the early stages of both B and T cell development. Our network will help to increase understanding of mature process of B and T cell, as well as the related blood diseases.","['Lin, Ying', 'Zhang, Qiong', 'Zhang, Hong-Mei', 'Liu, Wei', 'Liu, Chun-Jie', 'Li, Qiubai', 'Guo, An-Yuan']","['Lin Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang HM', 'Liu W', 'Liu CJ', 'Li Q', 'Guo AY']","['Hubei Bioinformatics &Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics &Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics &Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics &Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics &Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics &Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20151021,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2015/10/22 06:00,2016/09/15 06:00,['2015/10/22 06:00'],"['2015/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep15215 [pii]', '10.1038/srep15215 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Oct 21;5:15215. doi: 10.1038/srep15215.,,PMC4613730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We set out to examine the utility of the current fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based risk stratification in a homogenously treated population of transplant-eligible myeloma patients receiving novel induction regimens and early HDT with or without posttransplant maintenance therapy. FISH was available in 409 patients at the time of diagnosis for patients receiving HDT within 12 months of diagnosis. We present comprehensive outcomes for chromosome 14 translocations and 17p abnormalities that both support and refute current risk stratification models. In contrast to its current classification as a marker of 'standard risk' (SR), t(11;14) was associated with inferior overall survival (OS) when compared with the classical SR cohort. The use of novel agent maintenance therapy (bortezomib or lenalidomide) following early HDT ameliorates the negative prognostic value of high-risk (HR) cytogenetic markers. HR patients who received maintenance following early HDT had similar OS compared with the SR cohort at 5 years.","['Kaufman, G P', 'Gertz, M A', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Buadi, F K', 'Dingli, D', 'Hayman, S R', 'Kapoor, P', 'Lust, J A', 'Russell, S', 'Go, R S', 'Hwa, Y L', 'Kyle, R A', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Kumar, S K']","['Kaufman GP', 'Gertz MA', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Lacy MQ', 'Buadi FK', 'Dingli D', 'Hayman SR', 'Kapoor P', 'Lust JA', 'Russell S', 'Go RS', 'Hwa YL', 'Kyle RA', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Kumar SK']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151021,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Lenalidomide', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/10/22 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/10/22 06:00'],"['2015/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015287 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.287 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):633-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.287.
