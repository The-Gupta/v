A novel translocation within the previously identified 11q minimal region has been defined in a patient with CLL. The breakpoint is between genes POU2AF1 and BTG4. POU2AF1 is a B-cell-specific transcriptional coactivator, and BTG4 is a member of the BTG family of negative regulators of the cell cycle, making both of them good candidate genes for the pathogenesis of 11q- CLL. POU2AF1 was observed to be differentially expressed in the cells of patients with CLL compared to its expression in normal B cells in the absence of mutations. This may reflect ongoing stimulation and active accessory signaling in CLL cells. BTG4 could contribute to CLL pathogenesis following inactivation by haploinsufficiency.","['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of Experimental Haematology, ICMS, Barts & The London, Queen Mary School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']","['0 (BTG4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Living cell panning was used to screen anti-KG1a cell antibody fragments. After four rounds of panning, 27 out of 126 scFv fragments showed detectable binding to KG1a cells without cross-reaction to non-hematopoietic cell lines. Individual clones were analyzed by cell-based ELISA and flow cytometry for their binding specificity. Their sequence analysis showed highest homology to mouse gamma heavy chain subgroup II and mouse Kappa subgroup III genes, with four amino acids difference in VH and identical VL. Further, a fusion protein of scFv 5C1 to core-streptavidin was cloned and produced. It was used to search for cell-surface antigen on immunoblots and to test its effect on KG1a cell growth in cell culture. The scFv5C1::core-streptavidin fusion protein recognized a molecule with MW 85/125 KDa in immunoblots of KG1a cell membrane proteins and inhibited KG1a cell homoaggregation in cell cultures.

The standard ALT assay requires Southern analysis of high molecular weight genomic DNA. We aimed to establish and validate an ALT assay suitable for archived paraffin-embedded tumors and to use it to examine the prevalence and clinical significance of ALT in various types of tumors that are often telomerase negative. RESULTS: To assay for ALT, we detected ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs) by combined PML immunofluorescence and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization. APBs are PML nuclear domains containing telomeric DNA and are a known hallmark of ALT in cell lines. The APB assay concurred with the standard ALT assay in 62 of 62 tumors and showed that 35% of 101 soft tissue sarcomas (STS), 47% of 58 osteosarcomas (especially younger patients), 34% of 50 astrocytomas, and 0% of 17 papillary thyroid carcinomas were ALT positive (ALT+). The prevalence of ALT varied greatly among different STS subtypes: malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 77%; leiomyosarcomas, 62%; liposarcomas, 33%; synovial sarcomas, 9%; and rhabdomyosarcomas, 6%. ALT correlated with survival in glioblastoma multiforme and occurred more often in lower-grade astrocytomas, but ALT+ and ALT- sarcomas were equally aggressive in terms of grade and clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The APB assay for ALT is suitable for paraffin-embedded tumors. It showed that a substantial proportion of STS, osteosarcomas, and astrocytomas, but not papillary thyroid carcinomas use ALT. APB positivity correlated strongly with survival of patients with astrocytomas.",,"[""Children's Medical Research Institute, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the restricted expression of mRNA in B cell-lineage cells, IRTA2 is a new potential target for the immunotherapy of B cell malignancies. To study the expression of the IRTA2 gene product, we produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to IRTA2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A mouse used for cell fusion was DNA-immunized with an expression plasmid encoding the IRTA2 cDNA. The reactivity of MAbs secreted from the hybridomas were characterized with recombinant proteins of IRTA family members in an enzyme immunoassay and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Nineteen human lymphoma cell lines and blood cells from five patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) were analyzed with IRTA2 expression using FACS. RESULTS: Three MAbs (F25, F56, and F119) were selected based on their specific reactivity with recombinant IRTA2 and lack of cross-reactivity with other IRTA family members. In a FACS analysis, MAbs F56 and F119 detected IRTA2 expression in six of seven B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and one of six Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments and Western blotting using MAb F25 confirmed the expression profile. We also found that HCL cells from five patients expressed IRTA2.

The accelerated approval was accompanied by a postmarketing commitment by Novartis Pharmaceuticals to continue patient follow-up to determine duration of treatment response and survival. The present review, based on a safety and efficacy report submitted on December 20, 2002, summarizes data applicable to the conversion of these three CML indications to full approval status. RESULTS: Chronic phase CML: Five hundred thirty-two chronic phase CML patients who had not benefited from prior IFN therapy were treated at a starting imatinib mesylate dose of 400 mg p.o. qd; dose escalation to 800 mg p.o. qd was allowed. Patients had received a median of 14 months of IFN therapy at doses > or =25 million IU/wk and were all in late chronic phase, with a median time from diagnosis of 32 months. Median duration of imatinib mesylate treatment was 29 months, with 81% of patients treated for > or =24 months (maximum 31.5 months). Initial favorable treatment responses were sustained. An estimated 87.8% of patients who had a major cytogenetic response maintained their response 2 years after their initial response. After 2 years of treatment, an estimated 85.4% of patients were free of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, and the estimated overall survival was 90.8% (95% confidence interval, 88.3-93.2). Accelerated phase CML: Patients enrolled totaled 293: 235 with CML accelerated phase, 48 with relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 with relapsed/refractory acute myelocytic leukemia, and 8 with relapsed/refractory CML in lymphoid blast crisis. Patients received imatinib mesylate 400 or 600 mg p.o. qd. Dose escalation was permitted, to a maximum of 800 mg/d, taken as 400 mg bid. Efficacy results were improved in patients receiving imatinib mesylate 600 mg qd versus patients receiving 400 mg qd. The median duration of hematologic response was 29 versus 17 months and the estimated 24-month maintained hematologic response rate was 61% versus 42%. The median survival of patients treated with imatinib mesylate 600 mg qd was not reached versus 20.9 months for patients receiving 400 mg qd. Estimated 24-month survival rate was 66% versus 46%. The median survival in the advanced leukemia population (acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, and lymphoid blast crisis) was only 5 months, and only two patients are still on treatment. Blast crisis CML: A total of 260 patients were recruited. The imatinib mesylate dose was initially 400 mg qd (37 patients) but was subsequently increased to 600 mg qd (223 patients). Patients receiving imatinib mesylate 600 mg qd had a higher hematologic response rate than did patients receiving 400 mg (33% versus 16%). Major cytogenetic responses occurred in 15% of the 260 study patients. The overall median survival was 6.9 months: 7.1 months for patients treated with imatinib mesylate 600 mg and 4.7 months for patients receiving imatinib mesylate 400 mg. Estimated 12-month survival rate for all study patients was 32.1% and estimated 24-month survival rate was 18.3%. SAFETY: Imatinib mesylate was generally well tolerated, but relatively frequent reports of common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were encountered. The most frequently reported adverse events included gastrointestinal disturbances, edema, rash, and musculoskeletal complaints. These rarely led to discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm those of the interim analysis and suggest that imatinib mesylate represents an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase after failure of IFN-alpha therapy, in blast crisis, and in accelerated phase.",,"['Division of Oncology Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20857, USA. cohenma@cder.fda.gov']","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 25.,"Genetic modification of dendritic-cell (DC) function is an attractive approach to treat disease, either using mature DCs (mDCs) to immunize patients, or immature DCs (iDCs) to induce tolerance. Viral vectors are efficient at transducing DCs, and we have investigated the effect of transduction with a variety of viral vectors on the phenotype and function of DCs. Adenovirus (Ad), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), equine anemia virus (EIAV), and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) all up-regulate costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on DCs, as well as, in the case of Ad and lentiviral vectors, inducing production of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines. Following transduction there is activation of double-stranded (ds) RNA-triggered pathways resulting in interferon (IFN) alpha/beta production. In addition, the function of virally infected DCs is altered; iDCs have an increased, and mDCs a decreased, ability to stimulate a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Viral transduction of mDCs results in up-regulation of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, which down-regulates T-cell responsiveness.

Epub 2005 Jan 25.,"As a promising new class of anticancer drugs, camptothecins have advanced to the forefront of several areas of therapeutic and developmental chemotherapy. In the present study, we report that NSC606985, a rarely studied camptothecin analog, induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells NB4 and U937 and inhibits the proliferation without cell death in breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (bcr-abl) kinase-carrying leukemic K562 cells. For apoptosis induction or growth arrest, nanomolar concentrations of NSC606985 are sufficient. At such low concentrations, this agent also significantly inhibits the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with AML. For apoptosis induction, NSC606985 rapidly induces the proteolytic activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) and caspase-3 activation. Cotreatment with rottlerin, a PKCdelta-specific inhibitor, completely blocks NSC606985-induced mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and caspase-3 activation, while the inhibition of caspase-3 by z-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-DEVD-fmk) only partially attenuates PKCdelta activation and apoptosis. These data indicate that NSC606985-induced PKCdelta activation is an early event upstream to mitochondrial DeltaPsim loss and caspase-3 activation, while activated caspase-3 has an amplifying effect on PKCdelta proteolysis. In addition, NSC606985-induced apoptosis by PKCdelta also involves caspase-3-independent mechanisms. Taken together, our results suggest that NSC606985 is a potential agent for the treatment of AML.",,"['Department of Pathophysiology, Shanghai Institute of , Chong-Qing South Rd, Shanghai 200025, China.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,20050125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To develop a detailed genomic profile of ESC lines in two different species, we compared transcriptomes of one murine and two different hESC lines by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS). Over 2 million signature tags from each line and their differentiating embryoid bodies were sequenced. Major differences and conserved similarities between species identified by MPSS were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and microarray. The two hESC lines were similar overall, with differences that are attributable to alleles and propagation. Human-mouse comparisons, however, identified only a small (core) set of conserved genes that included genes known to be important in ESC biology, as well as additional novel genes. Identified were major differences in leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-beta, and Wnt and fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways, as well as the expression of genes encoding metabolic, cytoskeletal, and matrix proteins, many of which were verified by RT-PCR or by comparing them with published databases.

Identifying potential interactions between polyphenols may provide information regarding the efficiency of polyphenol-containing foods in cancer prevention. The objective of this study was to investigate the interactions of ellagic acid and quercetin with resveratrol, polyphenols which occur in muscadine grapes, with the hypothesis that the selected polyphenols would interact synergistically in the induction of apoptosis and reduction of cell growth in human leukemia cells (MOLT-4). To test this hypothesis, alterations in cell cycle kinetics, proliferation, and apoptosis (caspase-3 activity) were examined after incubation with ellagic acid, quercetin, and resveratrol as single compounds and in combination. Results showed a more than additive interaction for the combination of ellagic acid with resveratrol and furthermore, significant alterations in cell cycle kinetics induced by single compounds and combinations were observed. An isobolographic analysis was performed to assess the apparent synergistic interaction for the combinations of ellagic acid with resveratrol and quercetin with resveratrol in the induction of caspase 3 activity, confirming a synergistic interaction with a combination index of 0.64 for the combination of ellagic acid and resveratrol and 0.68 for quercetin and resveratrol.

Though induction of TLR2 or TLR4 by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in leukemia cells has been reported, however, the mechanism by which TPA up-regulates TLR2 or TLR4 remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of TPA on induction of TLR2 in U937 cells. TPA markedly induced TLR2 mRNA and protein expressions. TLR2 expression in response to TPA was attenuated by pretreatments with GF109203X and Go6976 (inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC)) and PD98059 (an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)), but not SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38s) and SP600125 (an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinases), suggesting involvement of PKC and ERKs in this response. Moreover, TPA-induced PKC activation was linked to generation of reactive oxygen species, which were dispensable for TLR2 expression in U937 cells. Pretreatments with GF109203X blocked TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERKs, suggesting activation of ERKs by PKC. In addition, TPA induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, which was shown by increased nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, a NF-kappaB inhibitory protein. Importantly, TPA-induced TLR2 expression was inhibited by blockage of NF-kappaB activation using NF-kappaB inhibitors, including MG132 and BAY11-7085. Specifically, TPA-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was effectively attenuated by GF109203X and PD98059, suggesting PKC and ERK regulation of NF-kappaB nuclear localization in response to TPA. Together, these results suggest that TPA-induced TLR2 expression in U937 cells may be at least in part mediated through activation of PKC and ERKs as well as NF-kappaB transcription factor, and that cross-talk between PKC or ERKs and NF-kappaB may exist.",,"['Chronic Disease Research Center and Institute for Medical Science, School of Medicine Keimyung University, #194 DongSan-Dong Jung-Gu, Daegu 700-712, Republic of Korea.']","['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 28.,"Cycloheximide (CHX) is an inhibitor of protein synthesis and commonly used to modulate death receptor-mediated apoptosis or to induce apoptosis in a number of normal and transformed cells. In this study we show that a close structural derivative of CHX, acetoxycycloheximide (E-73) induced rapid processing of procaspases and subsequent apoptosis with much higher efficacy than CHX in human leukemia Jurkat T cells. E-73 induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria even in the presence of the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone. The Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-x(L) suppressed cytochrome c release as well as processing of procaspases-3, -8, and -9 in E-73-treated cells. In Jurkat T cells transfected with the caspase-8 modulator FLIP(L), E-73 still induced activation of procaspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis, suggesting that the caspase-8 activity is dispensable for apoptosis. In contrast to CHX, E-73 drastically induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase. Inhibitory profiles of small-molecular kinase inhibitors revealed that JNK activation was critical for induction of cytochrome c release in E-73-induced apoptosis. Thus, our present results demonstrate that E-73, unlike CHX, induces strong activation of the JNK pathway and triggers rapid apoptosis mediated by the release of cytochrome c.",,"['Center for Biological Resources and Informatics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 4259 Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226-8501, Japan.']","['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'UX3Y1I395S (acetoxycycloheximide)']",,20041228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cycle-dependent expression of molecules involved in the embryo-endometrial dialogue has lead to the identification of a 'window of implantation'. This is the unique temporal and spatial expression of factors that allows the embryo to implant (via signalling, appositioning, attachment and invasion) in a specific time frame of 48 h, 7-10 days after ovulation. Integrin molecules, L-selectin ligands, mucin-1, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and pinopodes are involved in appositioning and attachment. The embryo produces cytokines and growth factors [interleukins, prostaglandins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] and receptors for endometrial signals (leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor, colony stimulating factor receptor, insulin-like growth factors and heparin binding epidermal growth factor receptor). The immune system plays an important role. Immunomodulatory factors such as glycodelin, inhibin and interleukin prevent a graft-versus-host reaction. Angiogenesis controlled by VEGF and prostaglandins is needed for formation of a receptive endometrium and a placenta. Identification of these factors has led to their use as markers of implantation that may identify defects causing subfertility. An ideal marker of implantation is sensitive and specific, and easy to obtain without disturbing implantation. Glycodelin and leukaemia inhibitory factor (serum) and integrins and pinopodes (biopsies) are promising candidates.",,"['VU University Medical Centre Amsterdam, IVF-Centrum, Poli Zuid, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands. da.hoozemans@vumc.nl']",,265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to quantify their changes in children with cancer during chemotherapy, and to correlate them to clinical condition and type of drugs. DESIGN: During a 3-month period all patients admitted for chemotherapy to the paediatric oncology ward were evaluated for inclusion. Patients with brain tumours, neuroblastoma (cranio)spinal irradiation and use of dexamethasone before the first blood sample were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma concentrations of T4, T3, rT3, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH, IGF-1, cortisol, PRL and physical well-being by means of questionnaires were measured before and during chemotherapy. RESULTS: In 19 children, 46 courses of chemotherapy and 123 plasma samples were analysed. During chemotherapy, mean concentrations of TSH, T3, Tg and cortisol decreased to 53, 67, 69 and 15% of the baseline value, respectively. Mean plasma rT3 increased to 217% of baseline. In 87% of all courses, one or more thyroid parameter(s) was aberrant. Furthermore, in 23 samples (19%) from 10 patients (53%), the concentration of IGF-1 was below the reference value (adjusted for sex and age). Small changes were seen in scores for clinical condition but none was related to a change in thyroid function determinant. Most changes in thyroid hormones could be attributed to using dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that, in children, thyroid hormone state changes significantly during chemotherapy, apparently not related to physical well-being but to the drugs administered.

The similarities in this pattern between different AML chimeric fusions have led to a paradigm that stresses the importance of the co-repressor complex in altering the pattern of expression of genes targeted by the DNA-binding moiety of the fusion. Such findings beg the question of whether the fusion proteins merely serve as anchors to recruit the co-repressor complex or whether they play other significant roles in leukemogenesis. The answers to this question may have therapeutic importance since we now have the ability to target various components of the co-repressor complex, such as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes.

The results indicate that both flavonoids inhibited lipid peroxides and the inhibition may be attributed to the prevention of loss of intracellular GSH levels in U937 cells.","['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Department of Chemistry, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN 37209, USA. wboadi@tnstate.edu']","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,"['2G12RR03032/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03AR46384-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S06GM08037-29/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EWSR1 and TAF15 belong to the TET family (TLS/FUS, EWSR1 and TAF15) of proteins. TET fusions have been identified in both solid tumours and acute myeloid leukaemia. The novel 12p translocations directly implicated TET fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia as well, and demonstrated the involvement of CIZ in haematopoietic malignancies. In addition, a new fusion E2A-CIZ was recently cloned as a result of a t(12;19)(p13;p13) in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing TET-CIZ fusions display a transformed phenotype in a focus formation assay. We show here that E2A-CIZ also transforms 3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting that the addition of a transactivation domain to the CIZ protein is involved in this phenotype. An artificial VP16-CIZ construct reveals similar transforming properties, supporting this. We have then analysed the domains within TAF15-CIZ that are necessary for 3T3 fibroblast transformation. Deletion of the zinc fingers of CIZ resulted in loss of both DNA-binding and transforming properties of TAF15-CIZ, whereas deletion of the other functional domains of CIZ had no effect. Fusion of a transactivation domain to CIZ is suggestive for a transactivating function in transformation. Luciferase experiments indeed showed that E2A-CIZ as well as VP16-CIZ transactivates the MMP7 promoter. Taken together, our results reported here suggest that transformation of 3T3 fibroblasts by CIZ fusions is dependent on DNA-binding and might involve transactivation of CIZ target genes.","['Copyright (c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfp384 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is still controversial as to whether CD34 expression (defined as at least 10-20% positive cells) has any prognostic effect in patients with AML who receive intensive chemotherapy. The present study investigated whether gene expression profiling could be used to further subclassify CD34(+) AML cell populations. METHODS: AML blasts derived from 25 patients were examined; these patients were randomly selected from a larger consecutive group of patients. CD34 protein expression was determined by flow cytometry and expressed as the percentage of positive cells. Gene expression profiles were determined by complementary DNA microarrays. RESULTS: By unsupervised hierarchical clustering our patients could be grouped into two or three major subsets depending on the methodologic approach before clustering analysis (filtering or flooring of data, respectively). However, both approaches identified a cluster characterized by high gene expression and membrane molecule level of CD34. When using the floored expression profiles, the patient cluster characterized by increased CD34 gene expression was also characterized by a high percentage of CD34(+) cells (median 82%, range 56-100%) compared with the two other major clusters (median 19%, range <1-55%), but three of four outpatients also showed a high percentage of CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSION: A major proportion of patients with AML and high CD34 expression (usually >80% CD34(+) cells; nearly all patients had >50% positive cells) showed similarities in gene expression profile. In contrast, patients with lower CD34 expression often had a profile similar to those of patients regarded as CD34(-) according to conventional criteria. Our results suggest that the possible prognostic effect of CD34 expression should be reevaluated in clinical studies using additional or alternative cutoff values to describe CD34 expression.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. anne.oyan@vir.uib.no']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were collected twice per week from 128 patients with hematologic diseases during periods of neutropenic fever after undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 448 blood samples were tested. RESULTS: There were 14 patients with IA (2 patients with proven IA and 12 with probable IA). The median index of the initial NASBA in the IA group was more than 10-fold higher than that in the non-IA group. Galactomannan antigenemia (index, >0.5) was detected with a sensitivity of 86%. In receiver-operator characteristic analysis, the cutoff index of NASBA for the presumptive diagnosis of IA was determined to be 5.0. Combination of these 2 parameters (either a GM-EIA index of >or=0.5 or a NASBA index of >or=5.0) improved the sensitivity of diagnosis to 100%. There was a close relationship between patient outcome and the kinetics of NASBA values: failure of negative conversion during treatment resulted in death in almost all cases. CONCLUSION: If either GM-EIA or NASBA results suggest IA, the diagnostic yield for IA could be improved, and NASBA could be a useful marker for predicting the clinical course and outcome of treatment.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, The Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. mogulkor@medimail.co.kr']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,20050103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical manifestations of furuncles caused by PVL-producing Staphylococcus aureus and the role of patients' background are not fully understood. METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction amplification to test for the PVL gene in 161 strains of S. aureus isolated from suppurative skin lesions. For all PVL gene-positive strains isolated from furuncles, we analyzed cutaneous manifestations, patient background characteristics, and bacteriological markers, including coagulase types, presence of the mecA gene, and toxin profiles, and we compared these results with those for PVL gene-negative strains. RESULTS: PVL genes were detected in 16 (40%) of the 40 S. aureus strains isolated from furuncles, 2 (28%) of the 7 strains isolated from carbuncles, 1 (14%) of the 7 strains isolated from abscesses, and 1 (5%) of the 20 strains isolated from folliculitis. PVL gene-positive S. aureus usually causes multiple (rather than single) furuncles, and such furuncles are usually associated with more-intense erythema around the lesions. PVL gene-positive strains were isolated from young adults without underlying diseases, whereas PVL gene-negative strains were isolated from patients with various systemic complications, including diabetes, leukemia, and autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSIONS: PVL gene-positive S. aureus strains are involved in the development of multiple furuncles with more-intense erythema, particularly in healthy young adults. An understanding of the characteristics of furuncles due to PVL gene-positive strains might be useful for preventing the development of the severe systemic infections.",,"['Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan. kota616@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp']","['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Leukocidins)', '0 (Panton-Valentine leukocidin)']",,20050106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PNH is closely related to aplastic anemia and may share its immune pathophysiology. In vivo expansion of dominant T-cell clones can reflect an antigen-driven immune response but may also represent autonomous proliferation, such as in large granular lymphocytic (LGL)-leukemia. T-cell clonality can be assessed by a combination of T-cell receptor (TCR) flow cytometry and complementarity-determining-region-3 (CDR3) molecular analysis. We studied 24 PNH patients for evidence of in vivo dominant T-cell responses by flow cytometry; TCR-Vbeta-specific expansions were identified in all patients. In four cases, extreme expansions of one Vbeta-subset of CD8+/CD28-/CD56+ (effector) phenotype mimicked subclinical LGL-disease. The monoclonality of these expansions was inferred from unique CDR3-size peak distributions and sequencing of dominant clonotypes. We conclude that the molecular analysis of TCR-beta chain may demonstrate clonal LGL-like expansions at unexpected frequency in PNH patients. Our observations blur the classical boundaries between different bone marrow failure syndromes such as AA, PNH, and LGL, and support the hypothesis that in PNH, the mutant clone may expand as a result of an immune-escape from antigen-driven lymphocyte attack on hematopoietic progenitors.",,"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. amrisita@unina.it']","['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicentre setting, a prospective non-concurrent analysis was performed on 2513 new AML patients, aged 12-78 years, consecutively enrolled in EORTC-GIMEMA trials between 1987 and 2001. Thirty-eight patients with sAML were identified and compared with a group of 114 de novo AML patients matched according to age, French-American-British criteria, white blood cell count at diagnosis, trial and time of diagnosis of AML. Induction treatment response, disease-free survival (DFS), duration and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in the two groups. RESULTS: Comparing the complete remission (CR) rate between 38 sAML patients and 114 de novo AML patients, selected according to the previously reported criteria, we observed no difference in the CR rates [25/38 (66%) versus 66/114 (58%); Pearson chi(2) 0.7393, P=0.390] as well as no differences while comparing the DFS and the OS between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that sAML patients are characterised by a good performance status permitting their recruitment in conventional trials without a previous myelodysplastic phase.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the mdr gene is a highly conserved protein, acts as a multidrug transporter, and has a major role in multiple drug resistance (MDR). Targeting of P-gp by naturally occurring compounds is an effective strategy to overcome MDR. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a glucosinolates present in cruciferous vegetables, is a promising chemopreventive agent as it is reported to possess antimutagenic, antitumorigenic, and antiestrogenic properties in experimental studies. In the present investigation, the potential of I3C to modulate P-gp expression was evaluated in vinblastine (VBL)-resistant K562 human leukemic cells. The resistant K562 cells (K562/R10) were found to be cross-resistant to vincristine (VCR), doxorubicin (DXR), and other antineoplastic agents. I3C at a nontoxic dose (10 x 10(-3) M) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of VBL time dependently in VBL-resistant human leukemia (K562/R10) cells but had no effect on parent-sensitive cells (K562/S). The Western blot analysis of K 562/R 10 cells showed that I3C downregulates the induced levels of P-gp in resistant cells near to normal levels. The quantitation of immunocytochemically stained K562/R10 cells showed 24%, 48%, and 80% decrease in the levels of P-gp by I3C for 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. The above features thus indicate that I3C could be used as a novel modulator of P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance in vitro and may be effective as a dietary adjuvant in the treatment of MDR cancers.",,"['Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, M.G.

However its role in apoptosis needs to be elucidated. As2O3 interferes with the proliferation and survival of tumor cells via a variety of mechanisms. Drug-target interactions at the level of nuclear matrix (NM) may be critical events in the induction of cell death by As2O3. This study dealt with As2O3-target interactions at the level of NM in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 by proteomics. METHODS: K562 cells were cultured in MEM and treated with different concentrations of As2O3. The nuclear matrix proteins were analyzed by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and computer-assisted image analysis. RESULTS: As2O3 significantly inhibited the growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 at low concentrations. While more than 200 protein spots were shared among the nuclear matrices, about 18 distinct spots in the nuclear matrices were found characteristic for As2O3 treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 induces apoptosis in K562 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Our results demonstrated that for the detection of the onset of apoptosis, the alteration in the composition of nuclear matrix proteins was a more sensitive indicator than nucleosomal DNA fragmentation test. These results indicated that As2O3 might be clinically useful in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The changes of nuclear matrix proteins in the treated cells can be used as a useful indicator for this treatment.",,"['Department of Pathology, Beijing University, Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China. zihuiwang9@hotmail.com']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we reported the actions of another new 2-aminosteroid designated as H89712 on human leukemia cells. METHODS: Cell colony counting and MTT assay were used to determine proliferation. Cell morphology, histochemical staining, UV detection and cytometry were used to determine differentiation. RT-PCR was used to detect gene expression. Standard statistical method was used to analyze data. RESULTS: H89712 inhibited proliferation of HL-60 leukemia cells and the inhibition percentage in MTT assay was 18% at the dose of 10(-8) mol/L and 65% at the dose of 10(-5) mol/L, respectively. The inhibition for HL-60 in colony assay was 23% at the dose of 10(-8) mol/L and 96% at the dose of 10(-5) mol/L, respectively. H89712 also induced HL-60 cells toward macrophage-like differentiation. It was verified by flow cytometry that the percentage of positive CD14 expression in differentiated HL-60 cells was about 9 times higher than that of the control at the dose of 10(-8) mol/L and 20 times higher than that of the control at the dose of 10(-5) mol/L respectively, and this action involved upregulation of MafB gene in HL-60 leukemia cells. On the other hand, H89712 inhibited proliferation of K562 leukemia cells and the inhibition of K562 leukemia cells in MTT assay was shown by 34% at the dose of 10(-8) mol/L and 88% at the dose of 10(-5) mol/L respectively. The inhibition of K562 leukemia cells in colony assay was 53% at the dose of 10(-8) mol/L and 100% at the dose of 10(-5) mol/L respectively.

We tested NSC290205 for synergistic antileukaemic activity with adriamycin (ADR), (i) in vitro against the human lymphoid leukaemia cell lines: CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, and RPMI-8226, (ii) in vivo against P388 lymphocytic and L1210 lymphoid murine leukaemias (at incipient and advanced phase). Our results indicated significant cytostatic and cytotoxic synergy of NSC290205 and ADR in vitro. We further examined these results in vivo by replacing cyclophosphamide in the standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, prednisone) regimen with NSC290205 (AHOP) and comparing the efficiency of these two regimens in vivo. Although treatment of P388 and L1210 with cyclophosphamide or NSC290205 alone yielded equivalent results, AHOP produced a clear benefit for survival compared with CHOP against advanced leukaemias, confirming the in vitro observations [higher percentage increase in median lifespan of treated animals over the untreated (control): 188% and 239% in L1210, 308% and 353% in P388, P < 0.01, for CHOP and AHOP respectively]. AHOP also proved to be more genotoxic and cytostatic than CHOP, inducing higher sister chromatid exchange levels and cell division delays on P388 cells in vivo.

Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors, involved in a major Ca2+-dependent signalling pathway, normally reside in the cytoplasm but re-locate to the nucleus when activation of the pathway (e.g. following ligation of antigen receptors) leads to their dephosphorylation. This study found that one member of the NFAT family (NFATc1/NFAT2) can be detected in routine biopsy samples, where it is seen in essentially all lymphoid cells, but is absent from the great majority of non-haematopoietic cells. An immunohistological evaluation of NFATc1 in almost 300 lymphomas showed that most neoplastic lymphoid cells also express NFATc1 as a cytoplasmic constituent, although it is absent in classical Hodgkin's disease and plasma cell proliferations. Of particular interest was the finding that NFATc1 was relocated to the nucleus in a minority of lymphoid neoplasms (usually diffuse large B-cell lymphomas or Burkitt lymphoma), presumably reflecting activation of the NFAT pathway. It would be of interest to correlate this feature with patterns of gene expression and also with prognosis, since it may identify a subset of human lymphoma that is distinct in its molecular and clinical features.",,"['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. teresa.marafioti@ndcls.ox.ac.uk']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,"['Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(1):162.

The three major candidates accounting for the development of MDR in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are multi drug resistance gene (MDR1), multi drug resistance-related protein gene (MRP1) and lung resistance protein gene (LRP). So far, the differential impact of resistance gene expression on treatment outcome in AML is not clear. Therefore, we examined MDR1, MRP1 and LRP gene expression at diagnosis in 331 adult AML patients in the context of other known prognostic factors, such as age, disease status, cytogenetics and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication mutational status. Median observation time was longer than 5 years [64.1 months (40.0-87.6)]. MDR1 expression proved to be an independent prognostic factor for outcome of induction therapy (P <0.001) and overall survival (P=0.02), whereas MRP1 expression was an independent predictor for disease-free survival (P=0.01) in the multivariate analysis. This prognostic impact of both resistance genes was also found in patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics. LRP expression, however, had no impact on treatment outcome in AML. Our study shows that resistance gene expression should be considered together with age, cytogenetics and FLT3 mutational status for risk-adapted treatment strategies in AML in the future.",,"['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum C.

The Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR) has recorded transplant activity in Australia since 1992; transplant centres in New Zealand have corresponded with the Registry since 1998. AIM: To describe allogeneic and autologous bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation activity and outcomes in Australia and New Zealand from 1992 to 2001. METHODS: Each haemopoietic stem cell transplant centre in Australia and New Zealand contributes information to the Registry via a single information form compiled when a transplant is performed. An annual follow-up request is then sent from the Registry to the contributing centre at the anniversary of each individual transplant. RESULTS: Haemopoietic stem cell transplants in Australia have increased in number from 478 in 1992 to 937 in 2001, whereas in New Zealand the number has grown from 91 in 1998 to 105 in 2001, mainly as a result of an increase in autologous blood stem cell transplants. The number of hospitals contributing to the ABMTRR has grown from 20 in 1992 to 37 in 2001. The most common indication for autologous transplantation in 2001 was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whereas for allogeneic transplants it was acute myeloid leukaemia. The 9-year actuarial disease-free survival probability for patients aged 16 and above between 1992 and 2000 was 37% for autologous, 39% for allogeneic related donor and 30% for allogeneic unrelated donor transplants. Recurrence of the underlying disease was the main cause of death post-transplant after both allogeneic (26.3% of deaths in the first year and 68.0% of deaths in the second year) and autologous transplants (59.0% and 86.2%). Treatment-related mortality was 16.9% after allogeneic transplantation and 2.1% after autologous transplantation in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: The ABMTRR provides a comprehensive source of information on the use of bone marrow transplant, and allows for continuing analysis of changes in the application of this high-cost technology and the outcome of patients undergoing these procedures. Registry data provide a means for directing future clinical research into perceived areas of priority for improvement of outcome, such as the reduction in the risk of disease recurrence post-transplant.",,"['Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry, NSW, Australian. inivisonsmith@stvincents.com.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Causes of secondary (ie, reactive) eosinophilia include tissue-invasive parasitosis, allergic or inflammatory conditions, and malignancies in which eosinophils are not considered part of the neoplastic process. Primary eosinophilia is classified operationally into 2 categories: clonal and idiopathic. Clonal eosinophilia stipulates the presence of either cytogenetic evidence or bone marrow histological evidence of an otherwise classified hematologic malignancy such as acute leukemia or a chronic myeloid disorder. Idiopathic eosinophilia is a diagnosis of exclusion (ie, not secondary or clonal). Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia; diagnosis requires documentation of both sustained eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count > or = 1500 cells/microL for at least 6 months) and target organ damage (eg, involvement of the heart, lung, skin, or nerve tissue). Genetic mutations involving the platelet-derived growth factor receptor genes (PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta) have been pathogenetically linked to clonal eosinophilia, and their presence predicts treatment response to imatinib. Accordingly, cytogenetic and/or molecular investigations for the presence of an imatinib-sensitive molecular target should accompany current evaluation for primary eosinophilia. In the absence of such a drug target, specific treatment is dictated by the underlying hematologic malignancy in cases of clonal eosinophilia; however, the initial treatment of choice for symptomatic patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome is prednisone and/or interferon alfa.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine and Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minn 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 14.,"BACKGROUND: This report describes the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents bearers of oncological disease who were admitted to PICU with severe sepsis and septic shock. The predicting factors for mortality and for need of pulmonary mechanical ventilation were also determined. METHODS: Thirty-three children diagnosed with severe sepsis and septic shock were evaluated prospectively at the PICU of Hospital do Cancer between June and December of 2001. RESULTS: Thirty-three admissions were analyzed during this period; ages ranged from 1 to 23 years; 16 (48%) were boys and 17 (52%) were girls. Twenty patients had leukemia/lymphoma and 13 patients had solid tumors. Twenty-eight patients had a diagnosis of infectious diseases. In 73% of the patients, infection germs were isolated and gram negative organisms were responsible for 67% of the samples. Respiratory support was necessary for 18 patients (54%), inotropic support for 22 (67%) and dialysis for four patients. The mortality rate was of 41% for patients who needed inotropic support, of 69% for those requiring respiratory support and of 100% for those with an indication for dialysis. The overall mortality rate was of 27%. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that early intensive treatment for children with cancer exhibiting severe sepsis and/or septic shock could be an important factor to influence the mortality rate of these patients. Moreover, that noninvasive ventilation could be an option to reduce endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation.",,"['Hospital do Cancer, Sao Paulo, SP.']",['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)'],,20050114,,Sepse grave e choque septico em criancas com cancer: fatores preditores de obito.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pool of stem cells in target tissue has been suggested as a critical factor linking early life exposures to cancer. We examined the relation between intrauterine hormone levels and measurements of stem cell potential in umbilical cord blood. Cord blood donors were 40 women, ages >/=18 years, who delivered, from August 2002 to June 2003, a singleton birth after a gestation of at least 37 weeks. We assayed plasma concentrations of estradiol, unconjugated estriol, testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, sex hormone binding globulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF binding protein-3. For stem cell potential, we measured concentrations of CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM). We applied linear regression analysis and controlled for maternal and neonatal characteristics. We found strong positive associations between IGF-I and stem cell measures, 1 SD increase in IGF-I being associated with a 41% increase in CD34(+) (P = 0.008), a 109% increase in CD34(+)CD38(-) (P = 0.005), and a 94% increase in CFU-GM (P = 0.01). Similar associations were observed for IGF binding protein-3. Among steroid hormones, estriol and testosterone were significantly positively associated with CD34(+) and CFU-GM.

In 16 cell lines, a baseline gene expression pattern distinguished l-asparaginase sensitivity from resistance. However, for 28 pediatric ALL samples, no consistent baseline expression pattern was associated with sensitivity to l-asparaginase. In particular, baseline expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) was not predictive of response to l-asparaginase. After exposure to l-asparaginase, 5 cell lines and 10 clinical samples exhibited very similar changes in the expression of a large number of genes. However, the gene expression changes occurred more slowly in the clinical samples. These changes included a consistent increase in expression of tRNA synthetases and solute transporters and activating transcription factor and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein family members, a response similar to that observed with amino acid starvation. There was also a consistent decrease in many genes associated with proliferation. Taken together, the changes seem to reflect a consistent coordinated response to asparagine starvation in both cell lines and clinical samples. Importantly, in the clinical samples, increased expression of ASNS after l-asparaginase exposure was not associated with in vitro resistance to l-asparaginase, indicating that ASNS-independent mechanisms of in vitro l-asparaginase resistance are common in ALL.

This effect was potentiated by cotreatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, and the Akt inhibitor Akt(i)5. However, the inhibitors did not increase the toxicity of the mitochondria-targeting drug lonidamine, and the DNA-specific drugs camptothecin and cisplatin, when used under similar experimental conditions as As2O3. The potentiation of As2O3-provoked apoptosis involved the increased disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increased caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release from mitochondria, increased Bax and Bid activation, and attenuation of 27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) expression; the potentiation was prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression. The PI3K/Akt inhibitors decreased the intracellular glutathione content, and caused intracellular oxidation, as measured by peroxide accumulation. Cotreatment with subcytotoxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide increased apoptosis induction by As2O3. On the other hand, the treatments did not significantly affect glutathione S-transferase pi expression and activity.

Epub 2005 Jan 21.,"Resistance to the Ableson protein tyrosine (Abl) kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate has become a critical issue for patients in advanced phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Imatinib-resistant tumor cells develop, in part, as a result of point mutations within the Abl kinase domain. As protein kinase B (Akt) plays a pivotal role in Abl oncogene-mediated cell survival, we hypothesize that concurrent inhibition of Akt will sensitize resistant cells to the residual apoptotic activity of imatinib mesylate, thereby overcoming the resistance. Here, we examined the effect of OSU-03012, a celecoxib-derived phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) inhibitor, on imatinib mesylate-induced apoptosis in 2 clinically relevant breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-Abl mutant cell lines, Ba/F3p210(E255K) and Ba/F3p210(T315I). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of imatinib mesylate to inhibit the proliferation of Ba/F3p210(E255K) and Ba/F3p210(T315I) were 14 +/- 4 and 30 +/- 2 microM, respectively. There was no cross-resistance to OSU-03012 in these mutant cells with an IC50 of 5 microM irrespective of mutations. Nevertheless, in the presence of OSU-03012 the susceptibility of these mutant cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced. This synergistic action was, at least in part, mediated through the concerted effect on phospho-Akt. Together these data provide a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome imatinib mesylate resistance, especially with the Abl mutant T315I.",,"['Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 336 L.

Epub 2005 Jan 21.,"Gain and/or loss of function mediated by chimeric transcription factors generated by nonrandom translocations in leukemia is a key to understanding oncogenesis. E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), a chimeric basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor expressed in t(17;19)-positive leukemia cells, contributes to leukemogenesis through its potential to inhibit apoptosis. To identify physiologic counterparts of this chimera, we investigated the function of other bZIP factors that bind to the same DNA sequence recognized by E2A-HLF. Here, we show that thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF), which shares a high level of sequence identity with HLF and recognizes the same DNA sequence, is expressed in a small fraction of each subset of hematolymphoid progenitors. When TEF was introduced into FL5.12 interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent cells, TEF protected the cells from apoptosis due to IL-3 deprivation. Unexpectedly, TEF also almost completely down-regulated expression of the common beta (betac) chain of cytokine receptors. Consequently, TEF-expressing cells accumulated in G(0)/G(1) phase without undergoing apoptosis. These findings suggest that TEF is one of the apoptotic regulators in hematopoietic progenitors and controls hematopoietic-cell proliferation by regulating the expression of the betac chain.

The observed regimen-related toxicities and nonhematologic toxicities were all found to be acceptable. Disease relapse was the main cause of treatment failure. Three patients who had a relapse subsequently responded to a rapid discontinuation of the immunosuppressive agent and thereafter achieved another remission. After RIST, the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) proviral load became undetectable in 8 patients. RIST is thus considered to be a feasible treatment for ATL.

This paper describes real time PCR and RT-PCR assays for quantitation of the proviral DNA and viral RNA of BM5d and BM5e. Data is presented describing the change in BM5d and BM5e proviral DNA levels and viral RNA levels in both blood and spleen in the first 8 weeks of infection. Infected mice have increasing levels of BM5d and BM5e viral DNA and RNA detectable from as early as 2 weeks post infection. Similar levels of proviral DNA was found for BM5d and BM5e in PBMC and spleen, however higher levels of BM5e viral RNA were observed in both tissues throughout infection. The assays described can be used as both a diagnostic tool and to investigate the direct effect of treatments on the BM5d and BM5e viruses and MAIDS development.",,"['Discipline of Microbiology, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,20041216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If this effect is due only to blocking leukotrienes or also owing to inhibiting proliferation and survival of inflammatory cells, is actually unknown. OBJECTIVE: Testing the hypothesis that MNT could influence T lymphocyte functional behaviour in vitro. METHODS: Normal T lymphocytes were analysed for surface expression of Cys-LTR(1) and Cys-LTR(2) by means of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in the resting state and after activation with T helper type 2 cytokine or T cell receptor (TcR) stimulation. Proliferative activity, as well as IL-4 andIFN-gamma production, were simultaneously determined in samples exposed to molar concentrations of MNT from 10(-8) to 10(-5). Programmed cell death in cultured samples was evaluated by means of propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Annexin V mAb staining. The complementary DNA microarray technique was adopted to identify gene products involved in apoptosis induction. RESULTS: Resting T cells expressed low levels of Cys-LTR. Upon anti-CD3 mAb activation, a progressive increase in Cys-LTR(1) and -LTR(2) expression was observed. Exposure to MNT reduced proliferative response to TcR engagement, increased IFN-gamma production and led to apoptosis at minimal concentrations of 10(-6) M. A progressive loss in BAD and B cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 activities, and an increase in the expression of CD27, TRAF3, TRAIL, p53 and Fas genes were also observed.

In acute myeloid leukemia, the loss (monosomy) of chromosomes 5 and 7 and the gain (trisomy) of chromosome 8 are common clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that metabolites of the human leukemogen benzene cause a higher rate of gain and loss among the chromosomes involved in leukemogenesis and, as such, are nonrandom and selective in their effects. Human peripheral blood was exposed to two metabolites of benzene, namely, hydroquinone (HQ) and benzenetriol (BT), and the ploidy status of nine different chromosomes (1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 21) was examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization of metaphase spreads. Poisson regression was used to provide interpretable incidence rate ratios and corresponding P values for all nine chromosomes. Statistically significant differences were found between the sensitivity of the nine chromosomes to gain or loss. Chromosomes 5 and 7 were highly sensitive to loss following HQ and BT exposure, whereas chromosomes 7, 8, and 21 were highly sensitive to gain in comparison to other chromosomes. Significant support for the a priori hypothesis that chromosomes 5 and 7 are more sensitive to loss induced by HQ and BT than the other seven chromosomes was also obtained. These data support the notion that benzene metabolites affect the ploidy status of specific chromosomes more than others and may initiate or promote leukemia induction through these specific effects.","['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.']","['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 20.,"Astins, a family of cyclopentapeptides, isolated from the roots of a medicinal plant Aster tataricus (Compositae), show antitumour activity. Their chemical structures consist of a 16-membered ring system containing a unique beta,gamma-dichlorinated proline [Pro(Cl2)], other non-coded amino acid residues, and a cis conformation in one of the peptide bonds. The beta,gamma-dichlorinated proline residue is considered to play an important role in their antineoplastic activities in vitro on nasopharynx carcinoma (KB) cells and in vivo on sarcoma 180 ascites and P388 lymphocytic leukaemia in mice. The acyclic astins without Pro(Cl2) do not show antitumour activity against S-180 ascites in vivo, suggesting that the cyclic nature of astins plays an important role in their antitumour activities. We synthesized new astin-related cyclopeptides differing from the natural product for the presence of some non-proteinogenic amino acid residues: Aib, Abu, -S(beta3)-hPhe and a peptide bond surrogate (-SO2-NH-) and we tested for their antitumour effect. We observed cytotoxic effects of the newly synthesized cyclic astins, but not with the acyclic analogue astins. We also observed that the cyclic astin induced apoptosis in a human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line (NPA cell line) and that apoptotis was associated with activation of caspases. The caspase family inhibitor, Z-Val-Asp-(OMe)-FMK, protected NPA cells from cyclic analogue astin-induced apoptosis. To determine which caspase was specifically activated, we assayed caspase activity in astin-treated cells in the presence of specific caspase and 8, 9 or 3 inhibitors, i.e. Z-IETD-FMK, Z-LEHD-FMK Z-DEVD-FMK, which inhibit caspases 8, 9 and 3, respectively. The data presented here show selective antineoplastic properties of the newly synthesized cyclic astins, and suggest, for the first time, a mechanism for their antineoplastic action through the activation of apoptotic pathway.",,"['Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Naples Federico II, Via Mezzocannone 16, 80134 Naples, Italy.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (astin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,20050120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicate that the targeting moiety (thiolated transferrin) was successfully coupled to the distal reactive maleimide terminus of poly(ethylene glycol)-phospholipid conjugates incorporated in the liposomal bilayer. Results from atomic force microscopy studies, performed to characterise vesicle surface topology, indicated that, to a certain extent, thiolated transferrin has the ability to associate in a non-specific manner with the lipid membrane of pegylated liposomes. This is an issue not commonly reported in the literature but which is crucial to demonstrate the targeting proof of principle. Nevertheless, fluorimetric studies together with confocal microscopy clearly demonstrate that liposomes bearing covalently coupled transferrin associate more extensively to human T-leukaemia cells in vitro than non-targeted liposomes. Cell mechanistic studies indicate that targeted liposomes bind specifically to transferrin receptors and are internalised via receptor-dependent endocytotic pathway. In addition, the biophysical features exhibited by the developed liposomes, namely their ability to promote pH-triggered cytoplasmic delivery of loaded material, make them promising delivery systems for in vivo targeting of therapeutic molecules to tumours.",,"['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.']","['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New therapeutics are therefore needed to achieve cure. Thus, gene therapy is an attractive new treatment modality for malignant bladder tumours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the efficiency of retroviral mediated reporter gene transfer into malignant urothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility of the transfection of bladder tumour with direct intravesical instillation of a defective retrovirus. The vector was derived from LXSN. The efficiency of transduction with the Moloney Leukaemia Murine virus-based vector, amphotrophic retroviral vector, was monitored through the expression of two marker genes (nls-LacZ and NeoR). The canine animal was chosen since it can present with spontaneous bladder carcinomas mimicking human pathology. Primary cultures of two normal canine bladder urothelium and two canine primary bladder tumours were first studied. We then investigated in vivo, in two normal and two spontaneous tumour bearing dogs, the transduction of urothelial cells following direct intravesical instillation of 2.10(4) to 3.10(6) of the retroviral vector. RESULTS: Transduced cells were evidenced in all primary cultures of canine normal urothelium and transitional cell carcinoma. Bladder biopsies from sound dogs instilled with the viral solution showed long lasting transduction up to 60 days long. Bladder cryosections from tumour-bearing dogs displayed transduction of superficial layers of urothelial cancer cells without passing through lamina propria. In vivo transduction was evidenced in 1 to 15% (mean 5%) of the cells in the tumours and preferentially addressed malignant cells. Normal epithelium either originating from sound or tumour-bearing animals was not transduced. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of in vivo retroviral transduction of bladder cancer using a clinically relevant procedure.",,"['Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan and Department of Oncology, Saint Louis Hospital, University Paris 7, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to 1) predict leukemia recurrence based on the frequency of MRD present in PBSC products, 2) establish the efficacy of different purging procedures, and 3) integrate this into a model that enables to predict whether or not to purge. METHODS: Minimal residual disease was measured with flow cytometry using leukemia-associated phenotypes as established at diagnosis. Toxicity of purging procedures was established using clonogenic assays. Purging procedures used were cryopreservation, hyperthermia, ether lipid ET-18-OCH3, and combinations. RESULTS: Minimal residual disease in PBSC products correlated significantly with relapse-free survival (n=24, p=0.003). At a cut-off value of 0.05% MRD the relative risk of relapse was 4.6 times lower in the group with less than 0.05% MRD. As measured in 54 PBSC products, the MRD level was less than 0.05% in 17 of 54 cases, between 0.05% and 0.5% in 19 of 54 cases, and higher than 0.5% in 18 of 54 cases. Based on the MRD cut-off of 0.05%, the log tumor reduction needed to achieve this threshold is zero for the 17 of 54 cases in which MRD was below 0.05%, less than or equal to 1 log in 19 of 54 cases, and greater than 1-2 log in 18 of 54 cases. When applying purging with 25 mug/mL ET-18-OCH3 combined with cryopreservation at 10% DMSO and hyperthermia at 42 degrees C combined with cryopreservation at 10% or 4% DMSO, there was greater than or equal to 1 log depletion of AML blasts. CONCLUSION: This study establishes (1) a threshold level for MRD above which prognosis is worse, (2) that stem cell products from 69% of patients have higher than this ""safe"" MRD level, and (3) that ET-18-OCH3 and hyperthermia may be used to purge products in part of these patients.",,"['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein (p-gp) might augment ceramide glycosylation by translocating glucosylceramide (GC) across the Golgi membrane. We aimed to show that glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) activity is linked to p-gp expression and resistance to ceramide-induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Apoptosis and cell-cycle analysis were measured using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Fluorescent microscopy assessed p-gp expression in, and rhodamine 123 uptake by, the Golgi. P-gp interaction with GC was assessed by modulation of rhodamine accumulation. The GCS activity assay was based upon the transfer of UDP-(3)H-glucose to C8-ceramide to form radiolabeled GC, by rate-limiting cell-derived GCS. TLC and fluorimetry were used to measure the metabolites of fluorescent ceramide. Cell viability was measured using 7-amino-actinomycin D staining and flow cytometry with an internal standard for cell enumeration. RESULTS: P-gp(+) cell lines (KG1a, TF-1) were resistant to C8-ceramide-induced apoptosis compared to p-gp(-) cell lines (HL-60, U937). P-gp inhibitors GF120918 and cyclosporin A enhanced ceramide-induced apoptosis in the p-gp expressing cells. P-gp expression was identified in the Golgi of these cells. Pgp's efflux function in TF-1 but not KG1a cells was inhibited by glucosylceramide. In the presence of p-gp inhibitors, R123 accumulation in the Golgi of TF-1 cells was lost, and GCS activity and lactosylceramide formation were downregulated. Intact cells were necessary for the involvement of p-gp in the regulation of GCS activity. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that ceramide induces apoptosis in AML cells and that p-gp confers resistance to ceramide-induced apoptosis, with modulation of the ceramide-glucosylceramide pathway making a marked contribution to this resistance in TF-1 cells.",,"['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham and Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Glucosylceramides)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes are silenced by histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruited by methylated DNA in their promoter regions. HDAC removes acetyl groups from histones and prevents the basic transcriptional machinary access to the target gene, leading to transcriptional repression. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) can restore the expression of the tumor suppressor and/or cell cycle regulatory genes in cancer cells and block the cellular proliferation of these cells. In this study, we investigated the in vitro antiproliferative activities of the HDACIs, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and valproic acid against 14 human lymphoid cancer cell lines. All of these cell lines were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of the HDACI. SAHA induced either G1 or G2-M arrest as well as apoptosis. SAHA downregulated cyclin D1 and D2, and upregulated p53, p21, and p27. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a remarkable increase in the level of acetylated histones associated with the p21 promoter after SAHA treatment.

To address this issue, we assessed the ability of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice to maintain such cells in their peripheral blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human peripheral lymphocytes stimulated with recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) and anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies were transduced with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene using the retroviral vector GCsap(MSCV) and then transplanted into NOD/SCID mice at 1 x 10(8) cells per mouse. RESULTS: Transplanted human peripheral lymphocytes survived and expressed EGFP in the mice over the 6- to 8-week posttransplant period without any signs of graft-vs-host disease. Of importance was that these cells remained at the G(0)/G(1) stage and again proliferated in response to cytokines when cultured in vitro. Interestingly, the mice in which the transduced T lymphocytes remained at the resting stage clearly elucidated the superiority of the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) LTR to maintain the transgene expression by nonproliferating T lymphocytes over the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)- and myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV)-derived LTRs, which was obscure in in vitro culture where the transduced lymphocytes was being stimulated with rhIL-2. CONCLUSIONS: The mouse model and GCsap(MSCV) vector described herein comprise a simple and reliable in vivo assay system for studies of gene and cell therapies employing human peripheral lymphocytes.",,"['Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, bleeding and thrombosis are major complications of APL that lead to early death in approximately 10% of patients despite the success of current treatment. This condition may be attributed, in part, to the diffuse activation of coagulation, hyperfibrinolysis, and non-specific proteolytic activity that is observed in patients with APL. Therapeutic agents that induce the differentiation of leukemia cells improve outcomes compared with those observed using chemotherapy alone. They also correct the hyperactivity of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, thereby reducing early death from bleeding. Prophylactic therapy with newer anticoagulants may prove beneficial in patients with APL, but this must be confirmed in well-designed, randomized, controlled trials.

Instead of using conventional Gly(4)Ser linkers to connect heavy/light chains, aggregation reducing linkers (ARL) were used which when combined with a new SLS-based refolding method reduced aggregation and enhanced the yield of final product. Toxicity was reduced at least 25-fold by repeating the two sFv molecules and adding a portion of the hinge-CH2-CH3 human constant regions.

METHODS: From 1970 to 1976, 94 women with stages I-III epithelial ovarian carcinoma enrolled in a prospective nonrandomized clinical trial were prescribed 20 Gy to the upper abdomen and 50 Gy to the pelvis followed by courses of melphalan (1 mg/kg/course). Primary endpoints were survival, recurrence, and toxicity. RESULTS: There were 19 stage I, 25 stage II, and 50 stage III patients. For all stages, overall survival was 42% at 5 years, 30% at 10 years, and 17% at 25 years. Median follow-up of the survivors was 24 years. Disease-free survival was 48% at 5 years and remained at 45% from 10 to 25 years. All but two recurrences occurred within the first 27 months. No recurrence or treatment-related death occurred after 8 years. No recurrence was salvaged. All but one initial recurrence was within the peritoneal cavity. Of the 31 patients undergoing a second-look surgical procedure, 84% were free of tumor. Only 8% of patients recurred after a negative second look. Stage and the presence of palpable postoperative disease were significant prognostic factors. Disease-free survivals were 95% from 5 to 25 years for stage I, 70% at 5 years and 60% at 25 years for stage II, and 20% from 5 to 25 years for stage III (P < 0.0001). Although no patient with postoperative palpable tumor was cured, 25% lived beyond 2 years. Stage III patients without postoperative palpable tumor achieved a 47% 25-year disease-free survival. Acute toxicity was acceptable, and 98% of patients completed radiation therapy. Chronic toxicity included a 12% small bowel obstruction rate and a 3% fatal second malignancy/hematological toxicity rate (two cases of acute myelocytic leukemia, one case of thrombocytopenia). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term disease-free survival obtained with abdominopelvic radiotherapy followed by single alkylating agent chemotherapy has not been exceeded by three subsequent decades of multiagent chemotherapy trials. Abdominal radiotherapy may be useful to consolidate complete responses following therapy multiagent chemotherapy, particularly with the upper abdominal dose escalation provided by intensity modulated radiation therapy and possibly in conjunction with chemotherapy.",,"['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. dusen001@umn.edu']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that p21WAF1 stimulated Tax-dependent NF-kappaB activation which influences a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In HTLV-1-infected cells, Tax is primarily involved in the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Here, we demonstrate that p21WAF1 affects Tax-dependent NF-kappaB signaling by inducing p100/52, an NF-kappaB-related protein. W4, a Tax-transformed rat fibroblast cell line, exhibits the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB signaling, potentially mediated by overexpression of RelB. Ectopic expression of p21WAF1 in W4 cells, which lack endogenous expression due to methylation of the p21WAF1 promoter, induces the expression of p100/52. Bcl-2 expression was also upregulated by ectopic p21WAF1 in this cell line, suggesting that p21WAF1 plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis by modulating NF-kappaB signaling in Tax-expressing rat fibroblasts.

However, relatively less attention has been given to exploratory, visualisation-driven approaches. Such approaches should satisfy the following factors: Support for intuitive cluster visualisation, user-friendly and robust application, computational efficiency and generation of biologically meaningful outcomes. This research assesses a relaxation method for non-linear mapping that addresses these concerns. Its applications to gene expression and protein-protein interaction data analyses are investigated. RESULTS: Publicly available expression data originating from leukaemia, round blue-cell tumours and Parkinson disease studies were analysed. The method distinguished relevant clusters and critical analysis areas. The system does not require assumptions about the inherent class structure of the data, its mapping process is controlled by only one parameter and the resulting transformations offer intuitive, meaningful visual displays. Comparisons with traditional mapping models are presented. As a way of promoting potential, alternative applications of the methodology presented, an example of exploratory data analysis of interactome networks is illustrated. Data from the C. elegans interactome were analysed. Results suggest that this method might represent an effective solution for detecting key network hubs and for clustering biologically meaningful groups of proteins. CONCLUSION: A relaxation method for non-linear mapping provided the basis for visualisation-driven analyses using different types of data. This study indicates that such a system may represent a user-friendly and robust approach to exploratory data analysis. It may allow users to gain better insights into the underlying data structure, detect potential outliers and assess assumptions about the cluster composition of the data.",,"['School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Ulster, BT37 0QB, UK. fj.azuaje@ulster.ac.uk']",,,20050120,,,,,,PMC548129,,,,,,,,,,,,

This drug functions by blocking the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain of bcr-abl, and has also been found to inhibit the c-abl, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, ARG and stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Reports have recently emerged demonstrating that imatinib also inhibits the growth of non-malignant haemopoietic cells. Here, we demonstrate that concentrations of imatinib within the therapeutic dose range inhibit the function of cultured monocytes (CM) from normal donors. A decrease in the response of CM to LPS was observed morphologically and functionally, with CM grown in the presence of imatinib showing decreased pseudopodia formation and inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-alpha production following LPS stimulation. Imatinib also reduced the ability of M-CSF and GM-CSF stimulated CM to phagocytose zymosan particles, with uptake of non-opsonized zymosan by M-CSF stimulated CM (M-CM) being most affected. M-CM that had been cultured in the presence of imatinib were also impaired in their ability to stimulate responder cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. These results demonstrate that human monocytes cultured in the presence of imatinib are functionally impaired, and suggest that imatinib displays inhibitory activity against other kinase(s) that play a role in monocyte/macrophage development.",,"['Division of Haematology, Hanson Institute, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. andrea.dewar@imvs.sa.gov.au']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, experts strongly disagree about whether this association is causal and, if so, how strong it is. In this article, we examine several alternatives to reduce EMFs from sources of the California power grid, including undergrounding distribution and transmission lines and reconfiguring or rephasing lines. The alternatives were evaluated in terms of the potential health risk reduction, cost, impacts on service reliability, property values, and many other consequences. Because of the uncertainty about an EMF-health link, the main effort was to determine the sensitivity of the decisions to the probability and seriousness of an EMF hazard. User-friendly computer models were developed to allow stakeholders to change the model assumptions and parameters to analyze the impacts of their own assumptions and estimates on the decision. The analysis clearly demonstrated that only four of the many concerns raised by the stakeholders could make a difference in the decision: health risks, costs, service reliability, and property values. Whether undergrounding, moderate alternatives for EMF reduction, or no change was the best decision depended on a few key factors, including the probability that EMF exposure is a hazard, the severity of this hazard, how the EMF reduction measures are financed, and the impacts on property values. While the analysis did not resolve the EMF issues, it showed that even in the most controversial settings, a little analysis goes a long way to clarifying the issues and to focus the debate.",,"['University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. detlof@aol.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cells are equipped with DNA damage response pathways that trigger DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and, if need be, apoptosis, to eliminate DNA damage or damaged cells. The consequences of these processes for stem cells can be profound: diminution in stem cell pools, or, because of altered gene expression, an increased chance for stem cell differentiation or malignant transformation. Furthermore, a number of DNA repair abnormalities are linked to premature aging syndromes, and these are associated with defects in the stem cell population. The specific DNA repair systems for which there are data regarding the impact of repair defects on stem cell function include O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, non-homologous DNA end-joining Fanconi's anemia protein complex, and homologous recombination. It has recently become clear that deficiencies of these processes are associated not only with cancer and/or aging but also with stem cell defects. This discovery raises the possibility of a link between aging and stem cell dysfunction.

This review explores an old idea that increased survival in childhood cancer can be achieved by inhibiting specific cancer targets. Specific therapeutic targeting would theoretically cause reduced morbidity as well as increased survival. Tumor-specific translocation-generated fusion proteins appear to be ideal tumor-specific therapeutic targets. This review will describe advances in aspects of target identification, potential for small molecule screening, and the evolution of clinical resistance to this new generation of pharmaceuticals. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in molecular biology have identified new protein targets along with increased understanding of the biologic role of these proteins. Ewing sarcoma family of tumors research has benefited from new target discovery and enhanced biologic understanding of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. Congenital (infantile) fibrosarcoma and cellular mesoblastic nephroma have been grouped based on the presence of a common translocation fusion protein, ETV6-NTRK3. Functional knowledge of ETV6-NTRK3 has advanced so that strategies for screening small molecule inhibitors can proceed. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia have benefited from the discovery of the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), thus showing how a molecular therapeutic target can be inactivated for improved therapy. This review will describe challenges raised by clinical resistance to imatinib mesylate as a paradigm for how resistance might evolve in other disease models. This review also describes how patients with synovial sarcoma might benefit from future therapy directed towards the SYT-SSX family of fusion proteins. SUMMARY: The increased utilization of small molecules to disrupt or inactivate tumor-specific molecular targets is rapidly evolving. The use of these small molecules to probe biology and treat disease is advancing towards a new generation of anticancer therapies.",,"['Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.']","['0 (ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein, human)', '0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (SYT-SSX fusion protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",61,,"['R01 CA088004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088004-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we observed that PMA treatment of NB4 cells caused an early response in Sp1 binding to the p21 and FasL promoters at 8 h. The firmly adherent cell phenotype, characteristic of differentiated cells, retained Sp1-binding activity to either promoter, but it was often lost completely in detached, apoptotic cells. The association of Sp1 with the p21 promoter during monocytic differentiation correlated with the levels of expressed p21 in the cytoplasmic fraction, as detected by immunoblotting. In HL-60 cells, very weak or no Sp1 binding to either promoter was observed. Low NF-kappaB affinity for its consensus sites and to the FasL promoter was characteristic of apoptotic cells.

Translocations involving the NPM gene cause cytoplasmic dislocation of the NPM protein. METHODS: We used immunohistochemical methods to study the subcellular localization of NPM in bone marrow-biopsy specimens from 591 patients with primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We then correlated the presence of cytoplasmic NPM with clinical and biologic features of the disease. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic NPM was detected in 208 (35.2 percent) of the 591 specimens from patients with primary AML but not in 135 secondary AML specimens or in 980 hematopoietic or extrahematopoietic neoplasms other than AML. It was associated with a wide spectrum of morphologic subtypes of the disease, a normal karyotype, and responsiveness to induction chemotherapy, but not with recurrent genetic abnormalities. There was a high frequency of FLT3 internal tandem duplications and absence of CD34 and CD133 in AML specimens with a normal karyotype and cytoplasmic dislocation of NPM, but not in those in which the protein was restricted to the nucleus. AML specimens with cytoplasmic NPM carried mutations of the NPM gene that were predicted to alter the protein at its C-terminal; this mutant gene caused cytoplasmic localization of NPM in transfected cells.

Epub 2005 Jan 19.,"As more and more effective targeted therapeutics have been developed to treat adults with cancer, it is of critical importance to devise appropriate in vitro experimental models to study their use in pediatric patients. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with Bcr-Abl translocation is one of the most difficult to treat and deadly diseases in children. The targeted kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate has been shown to induce an initial response but resistance often develops. Recently, the geldanamycin family of antibiotics has been found to induce apoptosis in many malignant cells, including adult CML and AML. We describe experiments in which 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was evaluated in the context of Bcr-Abl and resistance to imatinib mesylate. Pediatric ALL cell lines with varying Bcr-Abl status and imatinib mesylate sensitivity were generated and their growth inhibition by 17-AAG was studied in vitro. Western blots were used to follow the changes in proteins that correlate with cell survival. Results show that apoptosis was induced in all lines with an increased 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for Bcr-Abl positive but imatinib mesylate-resistant cells. Addition of 17-AAG greatly increased imatinib sensitivity in vitro. A decrease in p53, survivin, Her2/neu, and WT1 was seen in cells that expressed these proteins. With some notable exceptions, when combined with 17-AAG, the IC50 of most of the common chemotherapeutic agents decreased. We describe an experimental approach to investigate the complex interaction between Bcr-Abl status, imatinib mesylate sensitivity, and 17-AAG in pediatric ALL. Information from such an approach will provide means to devise combined treatment approaches and to follow their effectiveness in vitro.",,"[""Center for Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics for Childhood Cancers, Southern Alberta Children's Cancer Program, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta T2T 5C7, Canada.""]","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,20050119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have explored the possibility that this protein is associated with telomeres and participates in their maintenance. Rat brain hnRNP A2 was shown to have two nucleic acid binding sites. In the presence of heparin one site binds single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides irrespective of sequence but not the corresponding oligoribonucleotides. Both the hnRNP A2-binding cis-acting element for the cytoplasmic RNA trafficking element, A2RE, and the ssDNA telomere repeat match a consensus sequence for binding to a second sequence-specific site identified by mutational analysis. hnRNP A2 protected the telomeric repeat sequence, but not the complementary sequence, against DNase digestion: the glycine-rich domain was found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for protection. The N-terminal RRM (RNA recognition motif) and tandem RRMs of hnRNP A2 also bind the single-stranded, template-containing segment of telomerase RNA. hnRNP A2 colocalizes with telomeric chromatin in the subset of PML bodies that are a hallmark of ALT cells, reinforcing the evidence for hnRNPs having a role in telomere maintenance.

Epub 2005 Jan 19.,"Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The HTLV-I protein Tax is well known as a transcriptional transactivator and inducer of cellular transformation. However, it is also known that extracellular Tax induces the production and release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, which have adverse effects on cells of the central nervous system. The cellular process by which Tax exits the cell into the extracellular environment is currently unknown. In most cell types, Tax has been shown to localize primarily to the nucleus. However, Tax has also been found to accumulate in the cytoplasm. The results contained herein begin to characterize the process of Tax secretion from the cell. Specifically, cytoplasmic Tax was demonstrated to localize to organelles associated with the cellular secretory process including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Additionally, it was demonstrated that full-length Tax was secreted from both baby hamster kidney cells and a human kidney tumor cell line, suggesting that Tax enters the secretory pathway in a leaderless manner. Tax secretion was partially inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting that Tax migrated from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. In addition, combined treatment of Tax-transfected BHK-21 cells with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin resulted in a small increase in the amount of Tax secreted, suggesting that a fraction of cytoplasmic Tax was present in the regulated secretory pathway. These studies begin to provide a link between Tax localization to the cytoplasm, the detection of Tax in the extracellular environment, its possible role as an extracellular effector molecule, and a potential role in neurodegenerative disease associated with HTLV-I infection.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']","['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cyan Fluorescent Protein)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,20050119,"['1 F31 NS 044801/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each group had evidence that GATA-1 played an important role in erythroid gene expression, but little did they know that it would turn out to be a key regulator of development of not only red blood cells, but of several other hematopoietic cell types as well. Furthermore, few would have guessed that missense mutations in GATA1 would cause inherited blood disorders, while acquired mutations would be found associated with essentially all cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in children with Down syndrome (DS). With respect to the latter disorder, the presence of a GATA1 mutation is now arguably the defining feature of this leukemia.

Continuous efforts have driven to synthesize new related compounds, presenting decreased toxic side effects, metabolic inactivation, drug resistance, and increased water solubility. Identified structure-activity relationships have pointed out the importance of the 4beta-substitution and of the configuration of the D ring. Here we report the synthesis of two novel series of derivatives of 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin. The first bears a carbamate chain in the 4 position (13a-f), whereas, in the second series, in addition to this chain, the lactone ring has been modified by shifting the carbonyl from position 13 to position 11 (27a-f). Moreover, an analogue of TOP-53 having this lactone modification has also been prepared (32). From this study, structure-activity relationships were established. Compounds 13a and 27a displayed potent cytotoxic activity against the L1210 cell line (10 to 20-fold higher than VP-16) and proved to be strong topoisomerase II poisons more potent than VP-16.

In the cytoplasm, eIF4E acts in the rate-limiting step of translation initiation. In the nucleus, eIF4E facilitates nuclear export of a subset of mRNAs. Both of these functions contribute to eIF4E's ability to oncogenically transform cells. We report here that the homeodomain protein, HOXA9, is a positive regulator of eIF4E. HOXA9 stimulates eIF4E-dependent export of cyclin D1 and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNAs in the nucleus, as well as increases the translation efficiency of ODC mRNA in the cytoplasm. These activities depend on direct interactions of HOXA9 with eIF4E and are independent of the role of HOXA9 in transcription. At the biochemical level, HOXA9 mediates these effects by competing with factors that repress eIF4E function, in particular the proline-rich homeodomain PRH/Hex. This competitive mechanism of eIF4E regulation is disrupted in a subset of leukemias, where HOXA9 displaces PRH from eIF4E, thereby contributing to eIF4E's dysregulation. In regard to these results and our previous finding that approximately 200 homeodomain proteins contain eIF4E binding sites, we propose that homeodomain modulation of eIF4E activity is a novel means through which this family of proteins implements their effects on growth and development.",,"['Institute for Research in Immunovirology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.']","['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",,,"['R56 CA098571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90446/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1S10 RR 09145-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090446/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC544005,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, it was shown that the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) induces cellular senescence when overexpressed in primary human fibroblasts. The mechanism by which the PML IV isoform elicits this irreversible growth arrest is believed to involve activation of the tumor suppressor pathways p21/p53 and p16/Rb; however, a requirement for either pathway has not been demonstrated unequivocally. To investigate the individual contributions of p53 and Rb to PML-induced senescence, we used oncoproteins E6 and E7 from human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which predominantly target p53 and Rb. We show that E7, but not E6, circumvents PML-induced senescence. Using different E7 mutant proteins, dominant negative cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and p16 RNA interference, we demonstrate that Rb-related and Rb-independent mechanisms of E7 are necessary for subversion of PML-induced senescence and we identify PML as a novel target for E7. Interaction between E7 and a functional prosenescence complex composed of PML, p53, and CBP perturbs transcriptional activation of p53, thus highlighting a significant effect also on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.

However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not completely understood. One mechanism that has been suggested is induction of phase II detoxification enzymes. Expression of phase II enzymes is regulated by the antioxidant response element (ARE) and the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2). In this study, we determined the role of this transcription system in the induction of phase II enzymes by carotenoids. We found that in transiently transfected cancer cells, lycopene transactivated the expression of reporter genes fused with ARE sequences. Other carotenoids such as phytoene, phytofluene, beta-carotene, and astaxanthin had a much smaller effect. An increase in protein as well as mRNA levels of the phase II enzymes NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was observed in nontransfected cells after carotenoid treatment. Ethanolic extract of lycopene containing unidentified hydrophilic derivatives of the carotenoid activated ARE with similar potency to lycopene. The potency of the carotenoids in ARE activation did not correlate with their effect on intracellular reactive oxygen species and reduced glutathione level, which may indicate that ARE activation is not solely related to their antioxidant activity. Nrf2, which is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of control cells, translocated to the nucleus after carotenoid treatment. Interestingly, part of the translocated Nrf2 colocalized with the promyelocytic leukemia protein in the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. The increase in phase II enzymes was abolished by a dominant-negative Nrf2, suggesting that carotenoid induction of these proteins depends on a functional Nrf2 and the ARE transcription system.",,"['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)', 'ULW86O013H (Glutathione Disulfide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, these proteins represent attractive targets for novel anticancer agents. The small molecule, gossypol, was initially investigated as a contraceptive agent, but subsequently has been shown to possess anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo. Recently gossypol has been found to bind to Bcl-X(L) and, with less affinity, to Bcl-2. Here we investigate the ability of the (-) enantiomer of gossypol, (-)-gossypol, to overcome the apoptosis resistance conferred by Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) overexpression in Jurkat T leukemia cells. (-)-Gossypol potently induced cell death in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (IC50, 18.1+/-2.6 micromol/L) or Bcl-X(L) (IC50, 22.9+/-3.7 micromol/L). Vector-transfected control cells were also potently killed by (-)-gossypol (IC50, 7.0+/-2.7 micromol/L). By contrast, the chemotherapy drug etoposide only induced efficient killing of vector-transfected cells (IC50, 9.6+/-2.3 micromol/L). Additionally, (-)-gossypol was more efficient than etoposide at inducing caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine externalization in the setting of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) overexpression. (-)-Gossypol-induced apoptosis was associated with Bak activation and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, suggesting a mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic mechanism. Moreover, (-)-gossypol treatment of isolated mitochondria purified from Bcl-2-overexpressing cells also resulted in cytochrome c release, indicating a possible direct action on Bcl-2 present in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that (-)-gossypol is a potent and novel therapeutic able to overcome apoptosis resistance by specifically targeting the activity of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.

To detect as-yet-unknown cell-surface molecules recognized by NCRs, we developed soluble forms of NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 as staining reagents binding the putative cognate ligands. Analysis of UL16-binding protein-1 (ULBP1), ULBP2, and ULBP3 ligands for NKG2D and of potential ligands for NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 in healthy hematopoietic cells demonstrated the ligand-negative phenotype of bone marrow-derived CD34(+) progenitor cells and the acquisition of cell-surface ligands during the course of myeloid differentiation. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemic blasts from approximately 80% of patients expressed very low levels of ULBPs and NCR-specific ligands. Treatment with differentiation-promoting myeloid growth factors, together with interferon-gamma, upregulated cell-surface levels of ULBP1 and putative NCR ligands on AML blasts, conferring an increased sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis. We conclude that the ligand-negative/low phenotype in AML is a consequence of cell maturation arrest on malignant transformation and that defective expression of ligands for the activating NKG2D and NCR receptors may compromise leukemia recognition by NK cells.",,"['Department of Research, Experimental Hematology, Basel University Hospital, Hebelstrasse 20, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.']","['0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR2 protein, human)', '0 (NCR3 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",,20050118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have used the murine CML-like myeloproliferative disorder as a platform to characterize the pharmacokinetic, signal transduction, and antileukemic properties of PD166326, one of the most potent members of the pyridopyrimidine class of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In mice with the CML-like disease, PD166326 rapidly inhibited Bcr/Abl kinase activity after a single oral dose and demonstrated marked antileukemic activity in vivo. Seventy percent of PD166326-treated mice achieved a white blood cell (WBC) count less than 20.0 x 10(9)/L (20,000/microL) at necropsy, compared with only 8% of imatinib mesylate-treated animals. Further, two thirds of PD166326-treated animals had complete resolution of splenomegaly, compared with none of the imatinib mesylate-treated animals. Consistent with its more potent antileukemic effect in vivo, PD166326 was also superior to imatinib mesylate in inhibiting the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous leukemia-cell proteins, including the src family member Lyn.

Here, we provide an updated report on this strategy in 29 patients. At the time of enrollment, 23 patients (79.3%) achieved complete remission (CR). After the first imatinib cycle, the median breakpoint cluster region-Abelson oncogene locus (BCR-ABL)/ABL ratios decreased by 0.77 log in 25 (86.2%) responders, and their BCR-ABL/ABL ratios decreased further by 0.34 log after the second imatinib cycle, which included 7 molecular CR. One patient (4.3%) relapsed during the imatinib therapy. The remaining 3 patients were primarily refractory to both imatinib and chemotherapy. Twenty-five (86.2%) of the 29 patients received transplants in first CR. With a median follow-up duration of 25 months after SCT, the 3-year estimated probabilities of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 3.8%, 18.7%, 78.1%, and 78.1%, respectively. In comparison to our historical control data, first-line imatinib interim therapy appears to provide a good quality of CR and a survival advantage for patients with Ph(+) ALL.

Epub 2005 Jan 17.,"Pim-1 is an oncogene-encoded serine/threonine kinase primarily expressed in hematopoietic and germ cell lines. Pim-1 kinase was originally identified in Maloney murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomas and is associated with multiple cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (Wang, Z., Bhattacharya, N., Weaver, M., Petersen, K., Meyer, M., Gapter, L., and Magnuson, N. S. (2001) J. Vet. Sci. 2, 167-179). The crystal structures of Pim-1 complexed with staurosporine and adenosine were determined. Although a typical two-domain serine/threonine protein kinase fold is observed, the inter-domain hinge region is unusual in both sequence and conformation; a two-residue insertion causes the hinge to bulge away from the ATP-binding pocket, and a proline residue in the hinge removes a conserved main chain hydrogen bond donor. Without this hydrogen bond, van der Waals interactions with the hinge serve to position the ligand. The hinge region of Pim-1 resembles that of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase more closely than it does other protein kinases. Although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 also inhibits Pim-1, the structure of the LY294002.Pim-1 complex reveals a new binding mode that may be general for Ser/Thr kinases.",,"['Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA. marc_jacobs@vrtx.com']","['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,20050117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, there were two hundred and six subjects; 46 kidney transplant recipients, 59 liver transplant recipients, 34 patients with leukemia, and 67 healthy children. Adenotonsillar enlargement was assessed by using the obstructive sleep apnea-18-item questionnaire and by performing a focused physical examination of the oral and nasal cavity at the time of the child's routine visit in either the transplant clinic, outpatient oncology center, or general pediatric clinic. RESULTS: Comparison of questionnaire scores amongst the three groups showed significant differences between the healthy children and liver transplant recipients as well as those with leukemia. There was a significant difference in the physical examination scores of the children with leukemia as compared to the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adenotonsillar enlargement in pediatric transplant recipients can be an early indication of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. However, the prevalence of adenotonsillar enlargement in the transplant population does not appear to differ from that of the healthy population. Additionally, scores on the OSA-18 in the transplant population were confounded by chronic illness. Further prospective studies need to be performed to develop a screening tool to identify transplant recipients at risk for post-transplantation adenotonsillar lymphoma.",,"['Department of Surgery, Division of Head and Neck Surgery, University of California Los Angeles Medical Center, USA.']",,,20041230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant proviruses can be generated when two genetically different RNA genomes are packaged into the same retroviral particle. It was shown in several studies that recombinant proviruses could be generated in each round of HIV-1 replication, whereas the recombination rates of SNV and Mo-MuLV are 5 to 10-fold lower. The reason for these differences is not clear. One possibility is that these retroviruses may differ in their ability to copackage genomic RNAs produced at different chromosomal loci. RESULTS: To investigate whether there is a difference in the efficiency of heterodimer formation when two proviruses have the same or different chromosomal locations, we introduced two different Mo-MuLV-based retroviral vectors into the packaging cell line using either the cotransfection or sequential transfection procedure. The comparative study has shown that the frequency of recombination increased about four-fold when the cotransfection procedure was used. This difference was not associated with possible recombination of retroviral vectors during or after cotransfection and the ratios of retroviral virion RNAs were the same for two variants of transfection. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that a mechanism exists to enable the preferential copackaging of Mo-MuLV genomic RNA molecules that are transcribed on the same DNA template. The properties of Mo-MuLV genomic RNAs transport, processing or dimerization might be responsible for this preference. The data presented in this report can be useful when designing methods to study different aspects of replication and recombination of a diploid retroviral genome.",,"['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 223059 Minsk, Republic of Belarus. oklahomych@mail.ru']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,20050118,,,,,,PMC546228,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the results of a phase I gene transfer clinical trial using Rz2. METHODS: Apheresis was used to obtain a peripheral blood cell population from each of four HIV-negative donors. After enrichment for CD4+ T-lymphocytes, ex vivo expansion and genetic manipulation (approximately equal aliquots of the cells were transduced with the ribozyme-containing (RRz2) and the control (LNL6) retroviral vector), these cells were infused into the corresponding HIV-1-positive twin recipient. Marking was assessed over an initial 24-week period and in total over an approximate 4-year period. RESULTS: The gene transfer procedure was shown to be safe, and technically feasible. Both RRz2- and LNL6-gene-containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were detected at all time points examined to 4 years. There was concomitant gene construct expression in the absence of the need for ex vivo peripheral blood cell stimulation and there was no evidence of immune elimination of the neoR T-lymphocytes nor of silencing of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The proof of principle results reported here demonstrate safety and feasibility of this type of gene transfer approach.

METHODS: To identify risk factors for secondary infectious episodes among patients who responded to initial antibiotic therapy, we retrospectively analyzed 2 consecutive, prospective, randomized clinical trials performed by the International Antimicrobial Therapy Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer during 1991-1994. RESULTS: Of 1720 patients with their first episode of febrile neutropenia, 836 responded to the initial antibiotic regimen and were therefore suitable for our analysis. A secondary infection was observed in 129 (15%) of 836 patients that occurred at a median of 10 days (range, 1-28 days) after the onset of the primary febrile episode. Factors at both baseline and day 4 were analyzed. Age of >16 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.46; P<.001), acute leukemia in first induction (OR, 3.17; P<.001), presence of intravenous line (OR, 1.88; P=.04), severe neutropenia (defined as an absolute granulocyte count of <100 cells/mm(3)) on day 4 (OR, 2.72; P<.001), and type of documentation of the primary episode (i.e., microbiologically documented cause or unexplained fever; OR, 2.56; P=.001) were found to be risk factors for secondary infection.

Epub 2005 Jan 18.,"PURPOSE: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (AlloBMT) can be curative for patients with leukaemia. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a potentially life threatening complication of AlloBMT mediated by the T cells contained within the graft. In order to be able to control GVHD, the allogeneic T cells may be transduced with a suicide gene such as herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk). For this strategy to be successful, all subsets of T cells should be transduced to a similar extent. Also, the transduction protocol should not induce expression of unwanted homing receptors, nor should it lead to unwanted skewing of the T-cell receptor repertoire. We have studied the transduction efficiency of naive and memory subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and examined the transduced T-cell subsets for possible changes in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and homing receptor expression. METHODS: The cells were transduced using a Moloney murine retroviral vector carrying a conjugate of the genes encoding the truncated form of the cell surface marker, low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (DeltaLNGFR) and HSV-tk. Transduction efficiency and homing receptor expression were quantified by flow cytometry. TCR repertoire was determined by spectratyping. RESULTS: We obtained a transduction efficiency of 30-50% of the cells, with no difference between the T-cell subsets. Cell surface receptors responsible for homing to skin, gastrointestinal tract or lymph nodes were practically absent at the end of 2 weeks in culture. The activation procedure seemed to favour the expansion of certain T-cell clones over polyclonal populations. However, there was no difference in the TCR repertoire between transduced and non-transduced cells. CONCLUSION: Changes in the composition of the T-cell subsets at the end of the cell culture were the results of the activation, and not the suicide gene transduction. The transduced T cells did not express unwanted homing receptors.",,"['Institute of Immunology, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.']","['0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,20050118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last several decades major advances have been taken in the diagnostics, treatment, and understanding of its pathogenesis. However, much less is known about the either metachronous or synchronous concurrence of GIST and other tumours of different histogenesis. In the present study clinicopathological data of 43 patients with histologically proved gastrointestinal stromal tumour were studied mainly in regard of the occurrence of a secondary neoplasm. Among the 43, 7 cases were found with secondary tumour mainly of epithelial origin. In three cases (cases 3, 5, and 7) GIST concurred with colorectal adenocarcinoma, in one case (case 1) GIST occurred in a patient with a 3-years-history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), in other two (cases 2 and 4) the stromal tumour was combined with in situ adenocarcinoma of the stomach and carcinoid of the pancreas, respectively. In case 6, GIST concurred with a duodenal Brunner gland adenoma. In five cases the stromal tumour and the other neoplasm occurred synchronously, and in four of them, being the stromal tumour clinically silent, GISTs were intraoperative findings. This confirms the importance of surgical intraabdominal control before closure. In one hand the repeated concurrence of GIST and colorectal adenocarcinoma in our series, and on the other hand, that of GIST and adenocarcinoma of the stomach in the literature, may indicate an at least partly common factor, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms.",,"['Baranya Megyei Korhaz, Pecs 7623, Hungary. yst@pathology.pote.hu']",,,20050117,,Kettos tumorok a gasztrointesztinalis traktusban: szinkron es metakron stromalis (GIST) es epitelialis/neuroendokrin daganatok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis shows a mis-match between mortality and research spending. As well as crude mortality rates, other measures of cancer burden should be considered because they contribute additional information. 'Years of life lost' (YLL) summed over each individual dying after a diagnosis of cancer represents a population-based mortality indicator of the impact of that disease on society. Years of life lost divided by the number of deaths for each cancer site produces an additional statistic, the average years of life lost (AYLL), which is a measure of the burden of cancer to the individual patient. For 17 cancer sites where data are available, four tumour sites have a rather large difference in mortality, comparing YLL to crude mortality. Years of life lost shows the population burden from cancers of the ovary, cervix, and CNS to be rather larger than suggested by crude mortality, despite screening programmes for cervix cancer. Using YLL, the underprovision of funding for lung cancer research is similar to that reported using percentage mortality. Breast cancer and leukaemia receive a relatively higher research spend than the population burden of these cancers, and the spending on leukaemia is quite extreme. Prostate cancer has a low per cent YLL but attracts a moderate amount of research spending. The use of AYLL as an indicator of individual cancer burden considerably changes the ranking of the mortality from different tumours. The mean AYLL is 12.5 years. Prostate cancer has the lowest AYLL, only 6.1 years; brain tumour patients have the highest, at just over 20 years. Comparing AYLL to research spending suggests four 'Cinderella' cancer sites with high individual cancer burden but low research spending: CNS tumours, cervix and kidney cancers, and melanoma. Breast cancer and leukaemia have roughly average AYLL but a considerable excess of research spending. YLL emphasises the discrepancy between research spending and mortality, and may be helpful for decisions concerning research support. Average years of life lost measures the burden to individual patients and may be helpful where individuals' needs are relevant, such as palliative care. As well as crude mortality, more subtle and comprehensive calculations of mortality statistics would be useful in debates on research funding and public health issues.",,"[""Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, UK. ngb21@cam.ac.uk""]",,,,,,,,,PMC2361853,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work we studied the effect of all-trans-RA (ATRA) and its steroidal analogs EA-4, EA-136 and EA-137 on the growth of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells in vitro. The specific steroidal substrates were chosen in order to further investigate their ability to improve the pharmacological properties of conjugated antileukemic agents. ATRA decreased the number of HL60 cells from the first 24 h after its addition to the cell culture medium. The decrease was significant at concentrations higher than 10(-5) M. All the analogs tested also decreased the number of HL60 cells with an IC50 similar to that of ATRA, except for EA-4 whose IC50 was almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of ATRA, 72 h after its addition to the cell culture medium. Since angiogenesis is important for the growth of hematological malignancies, we furthermore studied the effect of ATRA and its analogs on the formation of new capillaries in the in vivo chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). ATRA, EA-136 and EA-137 induced angiogenesis in the CAM, increased the layer of CAM keratinocytes, and resulted in a significant degree of extravasation. EA-4 had no effect on either angiogenesis or tissue structure in general.

Arsenic exerts a dose-dependent dual effect: it causes differentiation at low concentrations and apoptosis at relatively high concentrations. Specific degradation of the leukemogenic PML-RARalpha fusion protein induced by arsenic leads to the differentiation of leukemia cells. The arsenic-induced apoptosis occurs through direct effects on mitochondria, causing the release of apoptotic proteins into the cytosol and the activation of caspases. Preliminary in vitro studies have also extended the potential anti-cancer effect of arsenic to non-APL leukemias, lymphoid malignancies and other cancers. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that arsenic exerts a broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects by induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, anti-angiogenesis and possible immunomodulation. Phase I and II clinical trials are underway to evaluate the feasibility, safety and potential effect of arsenic in various cancer types.",,"['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai, China.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)']",65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finding that these so-called cancer stem cells, or leukemic stem cells (LSC), can be purified away from the other cells in the tumor allows their precise analysis to identify candidate molecules and regulatory pathways that play a role in progression, maintenance, and spreading of leukemias. The analyses of the other, numerically dominant, cells in the tumor, while also interesting, do not directly interrogate these key properties of malignancies. Mouse models of human myeloproliferative disorder and acute myelogenous leukemia have highlighted the remarkable conservation of disease mechanisms between both species. They can now be used to identify the LSC for each type of human leukemia and understand how they escape normal regulation and become malignant. Given the clinical importance of LSC identification, the insights gained through these approaches will quickly translate into clinical applications and lead to improved treatments for human leukemias.",,"['Department of Pathology, StanfordUniversity School of Medicine, Beckman Center, California 94305, USA. passegue@stanford.edu']","['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,20050220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow cells from either Dok1- or SHIP-deficient mice are more susceptible to transformation by v-Abl. v-Abl-transformed preB cells from these knockout mice show Abl kinase-dependent hyperproliferation and moderate resistance to apoptosis. Elevated activation of Ras, Raf-1, and Erk, but not of Akt, was observed in either SHIP(-/-) or Dok1(-/-) v-Abl-transformed cells. This activation is sensitive to treatment with STI571. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with either a farnesyltransferase inhibitor or a MEK1/2 inhibitor abrogates the increased proliferation of SHIP(-/-) or Dok1(-/-) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Complementation of SHIP(-/-) or Dok1(-/-) cells abrogates their hyperproliferation and intracellular Erk activation. These data indicate that both SHIP and Dok1 functionally regulate the activation of Ras-Erk pathway by v-Abl and affect the mitogenic activity of v-Abl transformed bone marrow cells.",,"['Department of Medicine, Integrated Program in Cellular, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.']","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dok1 protein, mouse)', '0 (FTI 277)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,20050204,"['P01 CA-64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-77862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL and v-Abl acquire elevated tyrosine kinase activities by fusing to BCR and gag respectively and are capable of transforming myeloid and fibroblast cells. BCR-ABL is also the underlying cause in the development of most cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in humans.

These new data indicate that the ability of malignant SP cells to expel anticancer drugs may directly improve their survival and sustain their clonogenicity during exposure to cytostatic drugs, allowing disease recurrence when therapy is withdrawn.

Q-PCR assessment of expression levels for most Hoxa cluster genes in these tumors revealed an unprecedented impact of the proviral integrations on Hoxa gene expression, with tumors having one to seven different Hoxa genes overexpressed at levels up to 6600-fold above control values.

Consequently, a structural remodelling of this heterochromatin compartment is observed during differentiation but this remains to be defined from a topological point of view. In a previous study, we analysed the three-dimensional (3D) distribution patterns of centromere clusters (chromocentres) by confocal scanning laser microscopy and found that differentiation of the promyelocytic leukaemia cell line NB4 along the neutrophil lineage is associated with a progressive clustering of centromeres. This clustering was reflected by a decreased number of detectable chromocentres, i.e. groups of centromeres with a distance below the diffraction-limited resolution of optical microscopy. The purpose of this study was to perform a statistical analysis of the 3D distribution of chromocentres in NB4 cells. Several point field characteristics (Ripley's K-function, L-function, pair correlation function, nearest-neighbour distribution function) were investigated to describe the topology of chromocentres during differentiation of NB4 cells. The pair correlation function revealed a higher frequency of chromocentre distances between 350 nm and 800 nm in undifferentiated NB4 cells as compared with differentiated cells. The L-function and the nearest-neighbour distribution function confirmed these results. These data imply the existence of intranuclear heterochromatin zones formed by functionally related centromeric regions. In view of the observed decrease in the number of detectable chromocentres during differentiation, we hypothesize that these zones with a diameter of 350-800 nm in undifferentiated NB4 cells contract into zones with a diameter below 350 nm in differentiated cells.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Ulm, D-89070 Ulm, Germany.']",['0 (Heterochromatin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, high mortality rates may be associated with this therapy, especially in older patients, those with other comorbidities or who receive a second HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the factors associated with transplant-related mortality (TRM) and overall survival in 157 consecutive adult patients (104 males and 53 females) who received a HSCT [29 bone marrow (BM) transplantation and 128 peripheral blood (PB) transplantation] from a HLA-identical sibling between January 1995 and March 2002 in our institution. One hundred patients received a standard conditioning prior to HSCT (STAND) and 57 patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT. Fifty-eight patients were in an early phase at transplant and 99 in a non-early phase. Median age was 46 yr (16-66), and 90 patients (57%) were >45 yr of age. RESULTS: Patients in the RIC group were older than those in the STAND group, and had a higher proportion of non-early disease phases including a prior autologous HSCT in 39%. Median follow-up for survivors was 28 and 15 months in the STAND and RIC groups (P < 0,001), respectively. Cumulative incidence of TRM at 2 yr was 30% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22-41%] for the STAND group and 22% (95% CI 13-37%) for the RIC group [non-significant (NS)]. Factors associated with a higher TRM in multivariate analysis were: STAND vs. RIC conditioning regimen [relative risk (RR) 5.4; 95% CI 2.3-12.8; P < 0.001]; age > or =45 yr vs. <45 yr (RR 5; 95% CI 2.4-10.8, P < 0.001); second vs. first HSCT (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.3, P = 0.01) and non-T-cell-depleted vs. T-cell-depleted graft (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.8, P = 0.009). Overall survival (OS) at 2 yr was 52.5 +/- 10.4% for STAND group and 59 +/- 16.8% in RIC group. Factors associated with poorer OS in multivariate analysis were: STAND vs. RIC conditioning regimen (RR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.9, P = 0.001); age > or =45 vs <45 yr (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5, P = 0.002) and diagnosis [other than chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) vs. CML] (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.7 P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the introduction of RIC allogeneic HSCT for patients at high risk for TRM (advanced age, prior HSCT and non-T-cell depletion) leads to a reduction in the TRM and improvement in the OS.",['(c) Blackwell Munksgaard 2005'],"['Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the reasons for the attractiveness of this approach is the different mode of action of these antibodies compared to chemotherapy: they can exert tumor-suppressive effects by at least three major mechanisms: an intrinsic cytotoxic activity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and activation of complement-dependent cytolysis (CDC). These monoclonal antibodies can be applied in an unconjugated form or as a carrier of cytotoxic drugs or radioisotopes. The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has a direct anti-lymphoma activity, and is highly active in indolent and aggressive lymphoma, in particular in combination with chemotherapy. The anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab is effective in the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Another attractive approach is to link anti-CD20 antibodies to radioisotopes, thereby exploiting the radiosensitivity of malignant lymphomas: encouraging results were already presented for the yttrium-90-((90)Y-)labeled anti-CD20 antibody ibritumomab tiuxetan as well as for the iodine-131-((131)I-)labeled anti-CD20 antibody tositumomab.",,"['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Grosshadern, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munchen.

Because of the short pathlength (50-80 microm) and high linear energy transfer ( approximately 100 keV/microm) of alpha-emitting radioisotopes, targeted alpha-particle therapy offers the potential for more specific tumor cell killing with less damage to surrounding normal tissues than beta-emitters. These properties make targeted alpha-particle therapy ideal for the elimination of minimal residual or micrometastatic disease. Radioimmunotherapy using alpha-emitters such as (213)Bi, (211)At, and (225)Ac has shown activity in several in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and activity of targeted alpha-particle therapy in the treatment of small-volume and cytoreduced disease. Further advances will require investigation of more potent isotopes, new sources and methods of isotope production, improved chelation techniques, better methods for pharmacokinetic and dosimetric modeling, and new methods of isotope delivery such as pretargeting. Treatment of patients with less-advanced disease and, ultimately, randomized trials comparing targeted alpha-particle therapy with standard approaches will be required to determine the clinical utility of this approach.",,"['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biologic behavior of tumors in the fetus may differ dramatically compared with that of the same tumor detected later in life. Teratomas are the dominant histologic type and constitute the majority of both extracranial and intracranial neoplasms. Although often histologically mature, they may prove lethal because of their location and metabolic demands on the fetus. Large solid tumors may lead to cardiovascular compromise and hydrops fetalis. Extracranial teratomas are most commonly located in the sacrococcygeal area, followed by the head and neck, chest, and retroperitoneum. Fetuses with intracranial tumors have a poor prognosis regardless of histologic type. There are, however, two notable exceptions: lipomas and choroid plexus papillomas, both of which have a more favorable outcome. Neuroblastoma is the most common fetal malignancy. It may be either solid or cystic and is more often located on the right side. It typically has favorable biologic markers and stage at presentation. The prognosis for prenatally diagnosed cases is excellent. Other fetal neoplasms include soft-tissue tumors (both benign and malignant), leukemia, mesenchymal hamartoma of the kidney, and liver tumors (hemangioendothelioma, mesenchymal hamartoma, and hepatoblastoma).",,"['Department of Radiologic Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Bldg 54, Rm M-121, 14th and Alaska Ave NW, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA. woodwardp@afip.osd.mil']",,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the cause of ""late"" hepatitis due to HBV infection in two recipients after allogeneic HCT. STUDY DESIGN: Two male patients with acute myeloid leukemia and light chain myeloma, respectively, developed HBV-related hepatitis more than 2 years after HCT. All serum samples collected from the recipients, donors and their respective spouses were tested for HBV DNA by nested PCR, and if positive further quantified by Digene Hybrid Capture assay II. The HBV genotype was determined by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Genotypic analysis suggested that the cause of ""late"" hepatitis was due to acute HBV infection transmitted from their respective spouse. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that sexual precautions should be taken in these patients after HCT.

Most of the compounds were evaluated for their antitumour activity in the National Cancer Institute's in vitro human tumour cell line screening panel. Among them, particularly derivative 15c bearing a p-quinone methide moiety in ring C of the heterocycle was found to show in vitro activity comparable to clinically well established anticancer agents such as amsacrine or mitomycin C.

In addition, relative levels of proviral DNA were significantly lower in combination drug-treated animals compared to infected controls. Evaluation of femur cellularity, numbers of marrow-derived myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM and BFU-E) and peripheral blood indices revealed that TX and DX in combination with ddI were well-tolerated. However, treatment with HU and ddI induced moderate myelosuppression.

BAT and MDP caused necrosis in the cultures of pure immune cells, while the conjugates did not affect these cultures at all. Surprisingly, some analogues increased viability of K562 and Ab cells.

Despite its popularity in herbal therapies, little is known about the anticancer effect of Baizhu. In this study, the anticancer potential of Baizhu on human hepatoma and leukemia cell lines was evaluated. Baizhu methanol extract induced apoptosis in human lymphoma Jurkat T cells, leukemia U937, and HL-60 cells. This was confirmed by several methods, including hypodiploid cells detection using flow cytometry, the examination of apoptotic bodies containing cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy, and hypodiploid cell population inhibition using the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD. Finally, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)), were found to be elevated after treatment of these cells with Baizhu extracts. Antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) pretreatment almost completely inhibited Baizhu-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ROS are the key mediators for Baizhu-induced apoptosis. All these data indicate that Baizhu is a possible anti-tumor agent that induces apoptosis of human leukemia cells through ROS generation.",,"['Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",,20041215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 15.,"cAMP-mediated signaling potentiates glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis in lymphoid cells, but an effective means by which to take advantage of this observation in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies has not been identified. The primary objective of the current study was to determine whether PDE4 inhibitors, a class of compounds in late clinical development that raise intracellular cAMP levels by inhibiting type 4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE4), increase the efficacy of glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis in leukemic cells from patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Rolipram, a prototypic PDE4 inhibitor, synergized with glucocorticoids in inducing B-CLL but not T cell apoptosis. Rolipram also augmented glucocorticoid receptor element (GRE) transactivation in B-CLL cells. In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) with the cAMP antagonist Rp-8Br-cAMPS reversed both glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and GRE transactivation. CCRF-CEM cells, a well-studied model of glucocorticoid and cAMP-induced apoptosis, differed from B-CLL cells in that stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with the diterpene forskolin was required to increase both glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis and GRE activation, while PDE4 inhibition had no effect. Consistent with these results, inhibition of PDE4 induced cAMP elevation in B-CLL but not CCRF-CEM cells, while forskolin augmented cAMP levels in CCRF-CEM but not B-CLL cells. While rolipram treatment up-regulated PDE4B in B-CLL, forskolin treatment up-regulated PDE4D in CCRF-CEM cells. These studies suggest that PKA is required for and enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in B-CLL by modulating glucocorticoid receptor signal transduction.

We discuss these three types from the viewpoint of physicians. With the development of chemotherapy for malignant disease, patients with leukemia can be cured with bone marrow transplantation. During the leukopenia accompanying chemotherapy, Aspergillus sp. can infect the lungs. Aspergillus infections are resistant to antimicrobial agents, and thus surgical resection is necessary. Aspergillus infections may occur in previous sites of pulmonary tuberculosis lesions after the tuberculosis is cured producing massive hemoptysis. In this case, surgical resection is also needed. When patients who are immunocompromised due to various underlying diseases become infected with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, they require surgical resection.

The incidence of hematologic diseases in the elderly is increasing as the percentage of elderly people in the whole population increases. Acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes are commonly seen in the elderly. Malignant lymphomas are frequently seen in the elderly, and many elderly patients have poor performance status, and because they are more likely to suffer from impaired cardiac, respiratory, hepatic and renal function, as well as glucose intolerance, they are also more likely to suffer side effects due to chemotherapy. Particularly in patients aged over 80 years, to avoid side effects it is essential to adjust dosage and route of administration of chemotherapy. Although age is a significant negative prognostic factor for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is possible for patients to enter complete remission with improvement of host-side factors. The clinical application of Rituximab is expected to improve chemotherapy outcomes in elderly B-cell lymphoma. The median age at the time of initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) is 60-70 years, and age is a negative prognostic factor. Clinically, higher rates of infection and heavy comorbidity are characteristic of this condition in the elderly. Although the incidence of bony lesions in elderly patients with MM is not different from the non-elderly, they do have a higher incidence of bone pain and pathologic fractures compared with the non-elderly patients. As the response to chemotherapy is good in the elderly, it is worth trying chemotherapy for MM.

Previous studies have shown that reduction of bcl-2 expression by antisense therapy sensitizes cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In vitro, the Bcl-2 antisense drug oblimersen sodium (Genasense, previously known as G3139) enhances the apoptotic response in CLL cells to fludarabine (Fludara), corticosteroids, alemtuzumab (Campath), and rituximab (Rituxan). A phase I trial in patients with refractory/relapsed CLL showed that patients with CLL were more sensitive to oblimersen than patients with solid tumors. The maximum tolerated oblimersen dose was 3 mg/kg/d, and the most common dose-limiting reaction was hypotension, frequently in association with high spiking fever. In this study, oblimersen displayed limited single-agent activity, including tumor lysis syndrome, transient decreases in circulating CLL cells, and reduction of splenomegaly and size of lymph nodes. Major responses were observed in 9% of patients.

The goal of the current study was to investigate possible correlations between gene expression patterns of C/CR in leukemic cells, clinical features, and outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first disease recurrence. METHODS: Between January 1997 and December 2000, bone marrow (BM) samples were collected from 68 children with first ALL recurrence at diagnosis. These patients were enrolled in the ALL-REZ 95-96 disease recurrence trials of the Berlin-Frankurt-Munster study group. C/CR gene expression (interleukin [IL]-7, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-15, IL-18, IL-7Ralpha, IL-10R1, IL-15Ralpha, interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], vascular epithelial growth factor [VEGF], Flt1, and transforming growth factor-beta) was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and correlated with protein expression by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In comparison with T-lineage ALL specimens, expression of IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-15Ralpha, and Flt1 was significantly higher in B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL specimens (P <0.01). Among BCP ALL samples, gene expression of IL-7Ralpha and Flt1 was higher in pre-B than in common or pro-B leukemic cells. Moreover, expression levels of VEGF, IL-7Ralpha, IL-10R1, and IL-15Ralpha were lower in lymphoblasts of patients with a combined BM recurrence than in those with an isolated recurrence (P <0.05). Children with IL-15Ralpha expression above the median level had a significantly better probability of event-free survival (0.65 vs. 0.34, P=0.04) and survival (0.71 vs. 0.37, P=0.02) at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of distinct C/CR in ALL cells was associated with lineage commitment and differentiation of leukemic cells, as well as with prognosis. It remains to be evaluated whether these prognostic and biologic findings of distinct C/CR expression in leukemic cells also have therapeutical implications for future antileukemic strategies.",['2005 American Cancer Society.'],"['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Medical Center, Berlin, Germany. shuling.wu@charite.de']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of B cells freshly isolated from 40 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia demonstrated that the Src kinase Lyn, the switch molecule that couples the B cell receptor to downstream signaling, displays anomalous properties. Lyn is remarkably overexpressed at the protein level in leukemic cells as compared with normal B lymphocytes, with a substantial aliquot of the kinase anomalously present in the cytosol. Whereas in normal B lymphocytes Lyn activation is dependent on B cell-receptor stimulation, in resting malignant cells, the constitutive activity of the kinase accounts for high basal protein tyrosine phosphorylation and low responsiveness to IgM ligation. Addition of the Lyn inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 to leukemic cell cultures restores cell apoptosis, and treatment of malignant cells with drugs that induce cell apoptosis decreases both activity and amount of the tyrosine kinase. These findings suggest a direct correlation between high basal Lyn activity and defects in the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells. They also support a critical role for Lyn in B-CLL pathogenesis and identify this tyrosine kinase as a potential therapeutic target.",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.']","['0 (AG 1879)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (SU 6656)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,,,PMC544036,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, host-mediated macrophage apoptosis aids resolution of infection. The ability of macrophages to make this transition from resistance to susceptibility to apoptosis is important for effective host innate immune responses. We investigated the role of Mcl-1, an essential regulator of macrophage lifespan, in this switch from viability to apoptosis, using the model of pneumococcal-associated macrophage apoptosis. Upon exposure to pneumococci, macrophages initially upregulate Mcl-1 protein and maintain viability for up to 14 hours. Subsequently, macrophages reduce expression of full-length Mcl-1 and upregulate a 34-kDa isoform of Mcl-1 corresponding to a novel BH3-only splice variant, Mcl-1(Exon-1). Change in expression of Mcl-1 protein is associated with mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, which is characterized by loss of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential and translocation of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. Following pneumococcal infection, macrophages expressing full-length human Mcl-1 as a transgene exhibit a delay in apoptosis and in bacterial killing. Mcl-1 transgenic mice clear pneumococci from the lung less efficiently than nontransgenic mice.

Nowadays, lymphoma immunophenotyping is a necessary complement to morphology and molecular parameters in the diagnosis and monitoring of human hematopoietic malignancies. The aim of the present study was to determine whether immunophenotypic differences could be used to distinguish between non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma (NHL-B) and the normal B cell subpopulation by assessing the variability in the patterns of expression of some lymphoid antigens (CD5, CD19, FMC7, CD23, CD20, CD79b, CD38, CD22, CD10, sIgkappa, sIglambda, mIgA, mIgG, mIgM, and mIgD) in specimens obtained from patients with NHL-B. We have studied peripheral blood samples, lymph node suspensions, and bone marrow specimens from 20 patients with malignant lymphoma and from controls without oncohematologic disease. Some patients showed stable patterns of antigen expression that remained unchanged over time and were consistent from one specimen to another. Other patients showed more variability in the pattern of antigen expression from different specimens. The two-way cluster analysis of antigens revealed three patterns of expression: (1) most cells in most cases positive (CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD45); (2) most cells in most cases negative (CD10, mIgG, CD22, CD23,CD38); and (3) a mixed pattern with a variable number of positive cases and a variable percentage of positive cells in individual cases (CD22, CD38, CD79b, FMC7, mIgD, mIgM, mIgA, mIgG, sIgkappa, sIglambda). The expression of several antigens was strongly interdependent, even when antigens belonged to entirely different gene families. Such antigen pairs were CD19/CD45; CD19/CD79b; CD23/Igkappa; and CD45/CD79b.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has provided one of the best models, as the identification of a leukemia-specific hybrid tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL, p210, p190) has led to the identification and the successful therapeutic application of a powerful tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. The BCR-ABL fusion gene is the result of a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), which characterizes more than 95% of the cases of CML.

However, transgenic animal models have demonstrated that AML-specific translocations/inversions alone are insufficient to cause overt leukemia, which occurs only when point mutations affecting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) develop. Therefore, development of AML is now considered a two-step process in which RTK mutations provide a proliferative and a survival advantage to a clonal cell population already marked by impaired differentiation.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors pseudotyped with their glycoproteins could extend the range of tissues that can be transduced in both humans and animal models. Here, we established stable producer cell lines for HIV vectors pseudotyped with alphavirus Ross River virus (RRV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) glycoproteins E2E1. RRV E2E1-stable clones could routinely produce high-titer pseudotyped vectors for at least 5 months. SFV E2E1-stable clones, however, produced relatively low titers. We examined the properties of RRV E2E1-pseudotyped vectors [HIV-1(RRV)] and compared them with amphotropic murine leukemia virus Env- and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G-pseudotyped vectors. HIV-1(RRV) displayed a number of characteristics which would be advantageous in ex vivo and in vivo experiments, including resistance to inactivation by heat-labile components in fresh human sera and thermostability at 37 degrees C. Upon single-step concentration by ultracentrifugation of HIV-1(RRV), we could achieve vector stocks with titers up to 6 x 10(7) IU/ml. HIV-1(RRV) efficiently transduced cells from several different species, including murine primary dendritic cells, but failed to transduce human and murine T cells as well as human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).

The murine model has been used extensively to evaluate potential HIV-1 vaccines. However, the biology of HIV-1 Gag is somewhat different in human and murine tissues. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to form virus-like particles (VLPs) in human cells is severely curtailed in murine cells. Hence, it is not known whether immunizing mice with expression vectors encoding HIV-1 Gag provides an accurate assessment of the immunogenicity of these candidate vaccines in primates. In this report, we made use of a chimeric Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-HIV-1 Gag in which the p17 matrix domain of HIV-1 was replaced with the p15 matrix and p12 domains from MMLV. Murine cells expressing this construct released significant amounts of VLPs. The construct preserved H-2d-restricted antigenic determinants in the remaining portion of HIV-1 Gag, allowing immunogenicity studies to be performed with mice. We demonstrated that immunizing mice with plasmid DNA or adenoviral vectors encoding this chimeric Gag did not significantly increase the HIV-1 Gag-specific cellular or humoral immune response when compared to immunization with a myristoylation-incompetent version of the construct.

This protein is composed of three SU-TM subunit complexes. The fusion activity is loaded into the transmembrane TM subunit and controlled by the peripheral, receptor-binding SU subunit. It is assumed that TM adopts a metastable conformation in the native Env and that fusion activation involves the folding of TM into a stable form. Activation is suppressed by the associated SU and triggered by its dissociation, which follows receptor binding. Recently we showed that the two subunits are disulfide linked and that SU dissociation and triggering of the fusion function are caused by a switch of the intersubunit disulfide into an intrasubunit disulfide isomer using an isomerization-active CWLC motif in SU (M. Wallin, M. Ekstrom, and H. Garoff, EMBO J. 23:54-65, 2004). In the present work we address how the SU disulfide isomerase is activated. Using Moloney MLV, we show that isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond can be triggered by heat, urea, or guanidinium hydrochloride. Such protein perturbation treatments also significantly increase the kinetics and efficiency of viral fusion. The threshold conditions for the effects on isomerization and fusion are virtually the same. This finding indicates that destabilization of interactions in the SU oligomer induces the disulfide bond isomerase and the subsequent activation of the fusion function in TM.",,"['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']","['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)', 'JU58VJ6Y3B (Guanidine)']",,,,,,,,PMC544115,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening on D17 canine cells yielded D17-specific Env proteins that used the FeLV-C receptor. Screening on AH927 cells yielded Env proteins with a broader host range, with maximal titers on AH927 cells and similar or lower titers on other cells. These Env proteins used an unidentified non-FeLV receptor for entry. The A5 isolate obtained from the AH927 screen was readily concentrated to yield titers of 10(5) on human PC-3 prostate tumor cells. The sequence divergence observed among targeting peptides of library-selected Env proteins was greater than that found in parental FeLV isolates.

We found that HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells were more resistant to Apo2L-induced apoptosis than uninfected cells. Interestingly, HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells constitutively expressed Apo2L mRNA. Inducible expression of the viral oncoprotein Tax in a T-cell line up-regulated Apo2L mRNA. Analysis of the Apo2L promoter revealed that this gene is activated by Tax via the activation of NF-kappaB. The sensitivity to Apo2L was not correlated with expression levels of Apo2L receptors, intracellular regulators of apoptosis (FLICE-inhibitory protein and active Akt). NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and survival of ATL cells. The resistance to Apo2L-induced apoptosis was reversed by N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-lLnorleucinal (LLnL), an NF-kappaB inhibitor. LLnL significantly induced the Apo2L receptors DR4 and DR5.

The FeLV-945 surface glycoprotein (SU) is closely related to natural horizontally transmissible FeLV subgroup A (FeLV-A) but was found to differ from a prototype to a larger extent than the members of FeLV-A differ among themselves. The sequence differences included point mutations restricted largely to the functional domains of SU, i.e., VRA, VRB, and PRR. Despite the sequence differences in these critical domains, measurements of receptor utilization, including host range and superinfection interference, confirmed the assignment of FeLV-945 to subgroup A. Other proviruses isolated from the cohort contained similar sequence hallmarks and were assigned to FeLV subgroup A. A provirus from cat 1046 contained a histidine-to-proline change at SU residue 6 within an SPHQ motif that was previously identified as a critical mediator of fusion events during virus entry. The 1046 pseudotype virus entered cells only in the presence of the soluble cofactor FeLIX provided in trans, but it retained an ecotropic host range even in the presence of FeLIX. The mutational changes in FeLV-945 were shown to confer significant functional differences compared to prototype FeLV-A viruses. The substitution of FeLV-945 envelope gene sequences for FeLV-A/61E sequences conferred a small but statistically significant replicative advantage in some feline cells. Moreover, substitution of the unique FeLV-945 long terminal repeat and envelope gene for those of FeLV-A/61E altered the disease spectrum entirely, from a thymic lymphoma of a T-cell origin to an as yet uncharacterized multicentric lymphoma that did not contain T cells.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Ave. SL-38, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,"['R01 CA083823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC544135,,,,"['GENBANK/AY662447', 'GENBANK/AY662449', 'GENBANK/AY662450', 'GENBANK/AY662451', 'GENBANK/AY662452', 'GENBANK/AY662453', 'GENBANK/AY662454', 'GENBANK/AY662455', 'GENBANK/AY662456', 'GENBANK/AY662457', 'GENBANK/AY662458', 'GENBANK/AY662459', 'GENBANK/AY662460', 'GENBANK/AY662461']",,,,,,,,

The response of B cells to CpG stimulation involves increased proliferation, cytokine production, and costimulatory molecule expression. Similar effects have been observed following CpG stimulation of a variety of malignant B cells. Pediatric precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells express low levels of costimulatory molecules and are generally poor stimulators of T-cell responses. In this study, we evaluated the impact of CpG stimulation on precursor B-ALL cell lines and pediatric patient-derived samples. The ability to respond to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides was determined by the level of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) expression. In contrast to both nonleukemic B-cell precursors and mature B cells, the response of precursor B-ALL cells was characterized by increased CD40 expression but only small changes in CD86 levels and no induction of CD80 expression.

Of 414 patients centrally processed, 325 were considered for the categorization into the following cytogenetic-molecular subgroups: normal, t(9;22)/BCR-ABL, t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1, 9p/p15-p16 deletions, 6q deletions, miscellaneous structural abnormalities, and hyperdiploid. The inclusion into each subgroup was based on a hierarchical approach: molecular abnormalities with adverse prognosis had precedence over karyotypic changes with less-defined prognosis and the latter over ploidy. Patients without abnormalities and those with isolated 9p/p15-p16 deletions showed a relatively favorable outcome (median disease-free survival [DFS], > 3 years). The t(9;22)/BCR-ABL, t(4;11)/MLL-AF4, t(1; 19)/E2A-PBX1 defined a group with dismal prognosis (median DFS, 7 months), whereas 6q deletions, miscellaneous aberrations, and hyperdiploidy predicted an intermediate prognosis (median DFS, 19 months). This study highlights the importance of a combined cytogenetic-molecular profiling of adult ALL at presentation as a critical independent determinant of their outcome, providing further evidence of the necessity of a risk-adapted therapeutic algorithm for an optimal management of these patients.",,"['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University ""La Sapienza"" Via Benevento 6 Rome, 00161 Italy. mancini@bce.uniroma1.it']","['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,20050113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations transform hematopoietic cell lines and primary mouse bone marrow. Here, we analyzed the interaction between oncogenic Flt3-ITD mutations and the Wingless-type (Wnt) signaling pathway in the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D. Microarray analyses revealed higher mRNA expression of Frizzled-4, a receptor for Wnt ligands in 32D/Flt3-ITD cells. Findings were verified by quantitative realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and on the protein level. Compared with 32D/Flt3-WT (wild-type) cells, 32D/Flt3-ITD cells also showed greatly enhanced beta-catenin protein levels, irrespective of their exposure to Wnt3a, a ligand inducing the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway. In addition, 5 of 7 AML samples with Flt3-ITD mutations expressed high beta-catenin protein levels, whereas patients with wild-type Flt3 did not. Also, Flt3-ITD induced enhanced T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcriptional activity and the induction of the Wnt target gene c-myc. In the presence of Flt3-WT or Flt3-ITD signaling, Wnt3a slightly increased 32D cell proliferation. However, transfection experiments with dominant-negative (dn) TCF4 revealed a strong dependence of Flt3-ITD-mediated clonogenic growth on TCF activity. Taken together, our results indicate that Flt3-ITD and Wnt-dependent signaling pathways synergize in myeloid transformation.",,"['Department of Medicine, Hematology, and Oncology, University of Munster, Domagkstr. 3, 48149 Munster, Germany.']","['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Tcf7l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,20050113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemia form of TEL-TRKC (-exon 5 of TEL) enhanced hematopoietic stem cell renewal and initiated leukemia.

Epub 2005 Jan 13.,"To explore the genetic abnormalities that cooperate with AML1-ETO (AE) fusion gene to cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), we screened a number of candidate genes and identified 11 types of mutations in C-KIT gene (mC-KIT), including 6 previously undescribed ones among 26 of 54 (48.1%) cases with t(8;21). To address a possible chronological order between AE and mC-KIT, we showed that, among patients with AE and mC-KIT, most leukemic cells at disease presentation harbored both genetic alteration, whereas in three such cases investigated during complete remission, only AE, but not mC-KIT, could be detected by allele-specific PCR. Therefore, mC-KIT should be a subsequent event on the basis of t(8;21). Furthermore, induced expression of AE in U937-A/E cells significantly up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of C-KIT. This may lead to an alternative way of C-KIT activation and may explain the significantly higher C-KIT expression in 81.3% of patients with t(8;21) than in patients with other leukemias. These data strongly suggest that t(8;21) AML follows a stepwise model in leukemogenesis, i.e., AE represents the first, fundamental genetic hit to initiate the disease, whereas activation of the C-KIT pathway may be a second but also crucial hit for the development of a full-blown leukemia. Additionally, Gleevec suppressed the C-KIT activity and induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in cells bearing C-KIT N822K mutation or overexpression, but not in cells with D816 mC-KIT. Gleevec also exerted a synergic effect in apoptosis induction with cytarabine, thus providing a potential therapeutic for t(8;21) leukemia.",,"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Ruijin Medical College, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']","['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,20050113,,,,,,PMC545849,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 13.,"The dynamic and coordinated recruitment of coregulators by steroid receptors is critical for specific gene transcriptional activation. To identify new cofactors of the human (h) mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), its highly specific N-terminal domain was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid approach. We isolated ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia), a RNA polymerase II elongation factor which, when fused to MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) contributes to the pathogenesis of acute leukemia. Specific interaction between hMR and ELL was confirmed by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Transient transfections demonstrated that ELL increased receptor transcriptional potency and hormonal efficacy, indicating that ELL behaves as a bona fide MR coactivator. Of major interest, ELL differentially modulates steroid receptor responses, with striking opposite effects on hMR and glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transactivation, without affecting that of androgen and progesterone receptors. Furthermore, the MLL-ELL fusion protein, as well as several ELL truncated mutants and the ELL L214V mutant, lost their ability to potentiate MR transcriptional activities, suggesting that both the elongation domain and the ELL-associated factor 1 interaction domains are required for ELL to fulfill its selector activity on steroid receptors. This study is the first direct demonstration of a functional interaction between a nuclear receptor and an elongation factor. These results provide further evidence that the selectivity of the mineralo vs. glucocorticoid signaling pathways also occurs at the transcriptional complex level and may have major pathophysiological implications, most notably in leukemogenesis and corticosteroid-induced apoptosis.

The model was applied to a subset of 227 parents who had been employed or self-employed in agriculture or livestock breeding. It combines external data on pesticide use for 14 crops, 21 calendar years and 14 regions, and individual interview data on determinants (task and technology, personal protective equipment, field reentry, storing of pesticides, personal hygiene) of exposure. Recall was enhanced by use of checklists of pesticides in the interview. An external database provided information on the application rate (proxy for intensity of potential exposure) for each pesticide. The calendar time was individually converted to five time windows (year before conception, first, second and third trimester, and first year of the child). Time-windowed individual data on determinants of exposure and their expert-based general weights and their category-specific hazard values jointly provided an individual determinant score. This score was multiplied by the application rate to obtain an individual index of exposure intensity during application. Finally, average exposure intensity during entire time windows was estimated by incorporating in the model the individual time fraction of exposure during application. Estimates of exposure intensities were proxies assumed to be proportional to dermal exposure intensity, which represents the major pathway of occupational exposure to pesticides. A simulated sensitivity analysis resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.91 between two sets of 10 000 values of individual exposure indices, based on two different but realistic sets expert-assigned weights.

DiOC6(3) fluorescent probe determined alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RT-PCR confirmed the expression levels of Bcr-Abl in controls and K-562 cells treated with BA.

Aberrant DNA methylation of multiple promoter associated CpG islands is a frequent phenomenon in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present study, we scanned for mutations in the exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 of p73 gene. Using PCR-based methylation analysis, we have explored the prevalence of methylation of this pathway in a cohort of children with ALL (N=120). One pediatric patient showed mutation in exon 4, two showed mutation in exon 5, and none of the patients showed mutation in exons 6 and 7. Methylation of p73 gene is absent in the patients studied. Expression level of p73 m RNA was also examined in 40 ALL samples using reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction. All the patients showed p73 mRNA expression. However, p73 overexpression was observed in 58% of pediatric patients as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Further, mutation of p73 has been correlated with p73 m RNA and p73 protein status. The results show the presence of overexpressed protein in the samples with mutated p73 gene. Thus, it is presumed that mutation of p73 might lead to production of defective p73 protein and this might have a role in the process of leukemogenesis of ALL. Methylation of p73 does not play a role in pediatric ALL patients of our population. This report is the first demonstrating the presence of p73 gene mutations in exons 4 and 5 with overexpression of p73 protein and absence of p73 methylation in pediatric ALL patients of eastern Indian population.",,"['Molecular Oncology and Medical Biotechnology Division, Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar-751 023, Orissa, India.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first restriction activity described was the mouse Fv1 gene. Three different alleles of Fv1, capable of restricting different murine leukaemia viruses (MLV), have been characterized at the molecular level. Two further activities, Ref1, which acts on MLV, and Lv1, which acts on lentiviruses, have been identified in other mammalian species. Recently, it has become clear that Ref1 and Lv1 are encoded by the same gene, Trim5alpha, which inhibits retrovirus replication in a species-specific manner. A series of chimeras between the human and rhesus monkey Trim5 genes were created to map and identify these specificity determinants. The Trim5alpha SPRY domain was found to be responsible for targeting HIV-1 restriction. By contrast, N-MLV restriction appears dependent on both the coiled-coil domain and the SPRY domain. A single amino acid substitution (R332P) in the human Trim5alpha can confer the ability to restrict HIV-1, suggesting that small changes during evolution may have profound effects on our susceptibility to cross-species infection.",,"['Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,['MC_U117512710/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hoechst 33342's effects on apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi) were investigated in a myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL-60. Delta psi was detected with 2 lipophilic cationic fluorochromes: 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3)] or 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). Mitochondrial mass was measured with nonyl acridine orange (NAO). Protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) depolarized mitochondria in control experiments. Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide uptake. Hoechst 33342 at 10-20 mg/L decreased fluorescence for DiOC6(3) at 0.5 hr. The fluorescence partially normalized at 3 hr and then progressively decreased at 5-24 hr, resulting in cell shrinkage and death. Mitochondrial mass decreased 40-70% by 1 hr and 70-90% at 24 hr. A lower concentration of Hoechst 33342, 5 mg/L, reduced the delta psi at 0.5 hr, but delta psi returned to control values after 3 hr. Mitochondrial mass decreased 30-40% and then partially normalized, and cell viability was > 92% at 24 hr. Protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone lowered delta psi with little cell death. Thus, at high concentration, Hoechst 33342 induces depolarization of delta psi and subsequent apoptosis. Lack of apoptosis at low concentration of Hoechst 33342, despite depolarization of delta psi, indicates that mitochondrial membrane depolarization alone is insufficient to induce apoptosis.",,"['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan 48073-6769, USA.']","['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression in 10 GH-secreting and in 10 PRL-secreting pituitary macroadenomas by Northern blot, and investigated the possible correlation with in vivo and in vitro characteristics. We found that miR-15a and miR-16-1 are expressed at lower levels in pituitary adenomas as compared to normal pituitary tissue. Moreover, their expression inversely correlates with tumor diameter and with RARS expression (P < 0.05), but directly correlates with p43 secretion (P < 0.02). Therefore, miR15 and miR16 down-regulation in pituitary adenomas correlates with a greater tumor diameter and a lower p43 secretion, suggesting that these genes may, at least in part, influence tumor growth.","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Section of Endocrinology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies-University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (TUFM protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Peptide Elongation Factor Tu)', 'EC 6.1.1.19 (Arginine-tRNA Ligase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the need to find new substances that would enhance the radiation-induced apoptosis in cancerous cells is great, we studied the effect of epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG, a tea component), resveratrol (a wine component) and curcuma on cell proliferation and radiation-induced apoptosis in the human leukaemic cell line, EOL-1, derived from a patient with eosinophilic leukaemia. Cells were X-irradiated with 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 Gy and cultured in the presence of EGCG, resveratrol or curcuma (concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 microM) for 1, 2 or 3 days of culture. Cell proliferation was measured using trypan blue exclusion. Apoptosis was evaluated using light microscopy (morphology study after May-Grunwald Giemsa staining) and flow cytometry (annexin-V staining). Irradiation alone induced a dose-related reduction in cell proliferation and the appearance of polyploid cells in EOL-1 cells. Additionally, EOL-1 cells underwent a dose-related increase of apoptosis which, from the second day on, was accompanied by a dose-related increase of necrosis. When cells were exposed to EGCG, resveratrol or curcuma alone, a decrease in cell proliferation was observed, beginning from 25 microM EGCG and 50 microM resveratrol and curcuma, while an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was noted from 50 microM EGCG, 100 microM resveratrol and curcuma in EOL-1 cells, after only one day of culture. Simultaneous exposure to X-irradiation and, EGCG, resveratrol or curcuma resulted in a synergistic decrease of cell proliferation as well as in a synergistic increase of apoptosis and necrosis. These results suggest that, depending on the concentration, EGCG, resveratrol and curcuma enhance radiation-induced apoptosis in the leukaemic cell line, EOL-1 (EGCG >resveratrol >curcuma).

To address this issue, we have established M1/STAT3ER cells, where STAT3 is selectively activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT). 4HT stimulation did not have any effect on growth and morphology of M1/ STAT3ER cells, and did not induce the down-regulation of mRNA of c-myc and c-myb, which is necessary for M1 cell differentiation. On the other hand, mRNA of jun-B, IRF1 and p19 was increased by 4HT. DNA precipitation assay indicated that both stimulation of LIF and 4HT similarly activated STAT3ER. Introduction of a constitutive active MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) into M1/STAT3ER cells did not induce differentiation either. Together, our present data suggest that signaling other than the activation of STAT3 and MEK1 may be necessary for M1 cell-growth arrest and differentiation, while a set of early genes of LIF are induced by only STAT3 activation.",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']","['0 (Cdkn2d protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun))', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In breast cancer ERalpha plays a central role, where estrogen-regulated gene expression leads to tumor initiation, growth and survival. As an approach to silencing estrogen-regulated genes, we have studied the activities of a fusion protein between ERalpha and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor that acts through chromatin remodeling. To do this, we have developed lines from the estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in which the expression of the fusion protein PLZF-ERalpha is conditionally regulated by tetracycline and shows that these feature long-term silencing of the expression of several well-characterized estrogen-regulated genes, namely pS2, cathepsin-D and the progesterone receptor. However, the estrogen-regulated growth of these cells is not inhibited unless PLZF-ERalpha expression is induced, an observation that we have confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results show that PLZF-ERalpha is a potent repressor of estrogen-regulated gene expression and could be useful in distinguishing estrogen-regulated genes required for the growth of breast cancer cells.",,"['Department of Cancer Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,['MC_U120081322/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,"['Gene Ther. 2005 Mar;12(6):552.

It is bound and activated by the histone fold trimer NF-Y. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip experiments on two different CpG islands arrays using chromatin from hepatic HepG2 and pre-B cell leukemia NALM-6 cell lines, with different protocols of probe preparation and labeling. We analyzed and classified 239 known or predicted targets; we validated several by conventional ChIPs with anti-YB and anti-YC antibodies, in vitro EMSAs, and ChIP scanning. The importance of NF-Y binding for gene expression was verified by the use of a dominant negative NF-YA mutant. All but four genes are new NF-Y targets, falling into different functional categories. This analysis reinforces the notion that NF-Y is an important regulator of cell growth, and novel unexpected findings emerged from this unbiased approach. (i) A remarkable proportion of NF-Y targets, 40%, are complex transcriptional units composed of divergent, convergent, and tandem promoters. (ii) 40-50% of NF-Y sites are not in core promoters but are in introns or at distant 3' or 5' locations. The abundance of ""unorthodox"" CCAAT positions highlights an unexpected complexity of the NF-Y-mediated transcriptional network.",,"['Dipartimento di Biologia Animale, Universita di Modena e Reggio, Via Campi 213/d, 41100 Modena, Italy.']",['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)'],,20050111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old Caucasian man with chronic myeloid leukemia, never transfused, conditioned with BuCy120, received granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells from his HLA-identical sister. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and methotrexate. The patient engrafted showing complete donor chimerism and developed Grade 3 acute GVHD and subsequently extensive chronic GVHD. He received 2 units of RBCs on Days 13 and 14 without clinical signs of hemolysis. RESULTS: Patient was 0 Rh-K-JK(a-) and donor was 0 Rh+K-JK(a-). Pretransplant alloantibody screening was negative in the patient. In the donor, anti-E was detected before donation, together with anti-Jka and anti-Dib 4, 9, and 12 months after donation, likely triggered by RBC transfusion 2 months before cell harvest. In the patient, anti-Jka was detected on Day +25 and later anti-E and anti-Dib as well. In both, a Dia/Dia genotype was identified. Both parents were Di(a+b+). CONCLUSIONS: Three kinds of non-ABO alloantibodies were detected, including anti-Dib described for the first time after HPCT. The rapid development of antibodies in the recipient despite intensive immunosuppression suggests their production by the donor cells primed by the RBC transfusion before HPC harvest.

When imaging the punctate mitochondrial fluorescence originating from NAD(P)H in a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell at low laser powers, no morphological changes are evident, and photobleaching is not observed when many images are taken. At higher powers, mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence bleaches rapidly. To assess the limitations of this technique and to quantify the extent of photodamage, we have measured the effect of TPLSM on DNA synthesis. Although previous reports have indicated a threshold power for ""safe"" two-photon imaging, we find the laser power to be an insufficient indicator of photodamage. A more meaningful metric is a two-photon-absorbed dose that is proportional to the number of absorbed photon pairs. A temporary reduction of DNA synthesis in RBL cells occurs whenever a threshold dose of approximately 2 x 10(53) photon2 cm-4 s-1 is exceeded. This threshold is independent of laser intensity when imaging with average powers ranging from 5 to 17 mW at 740 nm. Beyond this threshold, the extent of the reduction is intensity dependent.

In this article, we describe clinical and molecular findings in a boy with a severe FA phenotype who developed AML by the age of 2. Although he lacked a strong family history of cancer, he was subsequently shown to carry biallelic mutations in the FANCD1/BRCA2 gene. These included an IVS7 splice-site mutation, which is strongly associated with early AML in homozygous or compound heterozygous carrier status in FA-D1 patients. Myeloid leukemia cells from this patient have been maintained in culture for more than 1 year and have been designated as the SB1690CB cell line. Growth of SB1690CB is dependent on granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor or interleukin-3. This cell line has retained its MMC sensitivity and has undergone further spontaneous changes in the spectrum of cytogenetic aberrations compared with the primary leukemia. This is the second AML cell line derived from an FA-D1 patient and the first proof that malignant clones arising in FA patients can retain inherited MMC sensitivity. As FA-derived malignancies are normally not very responsive to treatment, this implies there are important mechanisms of acquiring correction of the cellular FA phenotype that would explain the poor chemoresponsiveness observed in FA-associated malignancies and might also play a role in the initiation and progression of cancer in the general population.","['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","[""Cancer-Immunogenetics Laboratory, University of Manchester, St. Mary's Hospital, Hathersage Road, Manchester M13 0JH, United Kingdom. stefan.meyer@man.ac.uk""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify genes that act synergistically in BCL2-enforced leukemogenesis, we developed a murine B-cell lymphoma/leukemia model based on the IL-3-dependent Balb/C pro-B line (FL5.12). FL5.12 cells were stably transfected with antiapoptotic BCL-2 alone or in combination with proapoptotic BAX or nonfunctional mutant BAX, thereby creating various levels of imbalance within the BCL-2 family. Transfectants were intravenously injected into normal Balb/C mice. Whereas FL5.12 cells did not provoke leukemia, mice injected with stable transfectants died of leukemia over time. Disease incidence and latency time depended on the degree of imbalance in the BCL-2 family, supporting a model whereby BCL2 drives tumorigenesis. All mice presented with hepatosplenomegaly and leukemic FL5.12 cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow compartments. Leukemic conversion was accompanied by secondary genetic aberrations leading to clonal IL-3-responsive leukemia. Cellular transformation was independent of alterations in c-Myc or downstream apoptotic pathway. Leukemic clones retained a normal DNA damage response leading to elevated P53 and P21 levels and cell cycle arrest upon irradiation.

METHODS: We investigated the MRD status in four AML patients carrying different Flt3 mutations (three patients with Flt3 length mutations of the juxtamembrane domain, one patient carrying a mutation of the Flt3 tyrosine kinase domain, i.e. Flt3-TKD mutation) who underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT).

Epub 2005 Jan 12.,"GOALS OF WORK: Communication with parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer poses a number of problems, mostly due to the psychological effects of parental trauma. This study was designed to answer the following questions: How can we sustain the flow of communication with parents of children newly diagnosed with leukaemia so that it may become easier and more effective? What should we say to gather more reliable information from parents? How can we help empower their coping strategies? PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 4880 conversational turns in individual conversations carried out between psychologists and 21 parents of children with leukaemia. The conversations were aimed at gathering information of the families' daily routines. Dialogues were audiotaped and fully transcribed. The type and frequency of speech acts present in each turn were coded along 18 categories by two independent judges (inter-rater agreement, Cohen Kappa =0.73). MAIN RESULTS: The parental speech acts expressing emotion in various ways go up to 58% of the total number of their speech acts. The lag-sequential analysis showed that such expressions are not associated with any of the interviewer's speech act. The same analysis showed that, by contrast, the interviewer's style has an effect upon the cognitive aspects of parents' conversation. Support of hope favoured parental ability to identify their coping strategies. Explicit requests, confirmations such as ""sure"" and key words summarizing parents' viewpoints are followed by parental factual and objective narratives. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, a few practical recommendations for health care professionals are given in order to better communicate with parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer.",,"['Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padua, via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy.']",,,20050112,,,,,,,,['Support Care Cancer. 2005 May;13(5):275-6.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of TPA alone or in combination with capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) on growth and differentiation in myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells and in a TPA-resistant HL-60 variant cell line termed HL-525. Treatment of HL-60 cells with TPA (0.16-1.6 nM) for 48 h resulted in concentration-dependent growth inhibition and cell differentiation (via the macrophage pathway). Capsaicin (5-50 microM) inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of HL-60 cells with capsaicin alone only resulted in a small increase in the number of differentiated cells but treatment of the cells with TPA in combination with capsaicin synergistically increased differentiation. Moreover, inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), 7-hydroxystaurosporin (UCN-01; 100 nM) and chelerythrine (0.5 microM), significantly decreased HL-60 cell differentiation induced by the combination of TPA and capsaicin. These results suggest that PKC may be involved in HL-60 cell differentiation induced by TPA in combination with capsaicin. Capsaicin alone caused a very small increase in differentiation in the TPA-resistant HL-525 cells. However, treatment of HL-525 cells with combinations of TPA (0.16 nM) and capsaicin (10-50 microM) caused a strong synergistic increase in differentiation.

These endomorphins were able to reduce the viability of cultured HL-60 cells. The antiproliferative properties of endomorphins appeared to be attributable to their induction of apoptotic cell death as determined by ultrastructural change, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and increased proportion of the subdiploid cell population. To elucidate molecular events in the apoptosis, protein expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, Fas, and FasL were measured by western blotting using specific antibodies in HL-60 cells. The level of Bcl-2 indicated down-regulation, but the Bax, Fas, and FasL expression showed up-regulation as compared with the untreated control cells.

For instance, CT provides superior resolution for detecting calcification or fat, while MRI with its direct multiplanar ability more completely characterizes the heart, pericardium, mediastinum, and lungs. MRI also helps elucidate the pathophysiological effects of these tumors on cardiac function through gated cine-loop sequences. Beyond tumor characterization, both modalities can help confirm diagnosis through the addition of contrast, which helps distinguish tumor from myocardium, thrombus, and blood flow artifact.

Of the other half, most succumb to leukemia, but 5% to 15% die of treatment-related complications. Overweight children with AML seem to experience excess life-threatening and fatal toxicity. Nothing is known about how weight affects outcomes in pediatric AML. OBJECTIVE: To compare survival rates in children with AML who at diagnosis are underweight (body mass index [BMI] < or =10th percentile), overweight (BMI > or =95th percentile), or middleweight (BMI = 11th-94th percentiles). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of BMI and survival in 768 children and young adults aged 1 to 20 years enrolled in Children's Cancer Group-2961, an international cooperative group phase 3 trial for previously untreated AML conducted August 30, 1996, through December 4, 2002. Data were collected through January 9, 2004, with a median follow-up of 31 months (range, 0-78 months). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for survival and treatment-related mortality. RESULTS: Eighty-four of 768 patients (10.9%) were underweight and 114 (14.8%) were overweight. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables of age, race, leukocyte count, cytogenetics, and bone marrow transplantation, compared with middleweight patients, underweight patients were less likely to survive (HR, 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.87; P = .006) and more likely to experience treatment-related mortality (HR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.38-5.11; P = .003). Similarly, overweight patients were less likely to survive (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25-2.83; P = .002) and more likely to have treatment-related mortality (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.99-6.10; P<.001) than middleweight patients. Infections incurred during the first 2 courses of chemotherapy caused most treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: Treatment-related complications significantly reduce survival in overweight and underweight children with AML.",,"[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa 19104, USA. lange@email.chop.edu""]",,,,"['CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor, Scl/Tal1 (stem cell leukemia protein), is essential for hematopoiesis but thought to be required only for remodeling of endothelium in mouse embryos. By contrast, it has been implicated in hemangioblast formation in embryoid bodies. To resolve the role of scl in endothelial development, we knocked down its synthesis in zebrafish embryos where early precursors and later phenotypes can be more easily monitored. With respect to blood, the zebrafish morphants phenocopied the mouse knockout and positioned scl in the genetic hierarchy. Importantly, endothelial development was also clearly disrupted. Dorsal aorta formation was substantially compromised and gene expression in the posterior cardinal vein was abnormal.

Mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2, are common in JMML. We hypothesized that PTPN11 mutations induce hypersensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to GM-CSF and confer increased GM-CSF-stimulated phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) levels. To test this hypothesis, the wild-type (WT) and 3 mutant Ptpn11 cDNAs (E76K, D61V, and D61Y) were transduced into murine bone marrow cells to examine GM-CSF-stimulated granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) growth, macrophage progenitor proliferation, and activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Expression of the Shp-2 mutants induced progenitor cell hypersensitivity to GM-CSF compared with cells transduced with vector alone or WT Shp-2. Macrophage progenitors expressing the Shp-2 mutants displayed both basal and GM-CSF-stimulated hyperproliferation compared with cells transduced with vector alone or WT Shp-2. Consistently, macrophage progenitors transduced with the Shp-2 mutants demonstrated constitutively elevated phospho-Erk levels and sustained activation of phospho-Erk following GM-CSF stimulation compared with vector alone or WT Shp-2. These data support the hypothesis that PTPN11 mutations induce hematopoietic progenitor hypersensitivity to GM-CSF due to hyperactivation of the Ras signaling axis and provide a basis for the GM-CSF signaling pathway as a target for rational drug design in JMML.",,"['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, 1044 W Walnut St, R4-402, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. rchan@iupui.edu']","['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,20050111,['R01HL075816/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC1895012,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, MuLV RT showed 6.5-121.6-fold lower binding affinity (K(d)) to deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) substrates than HIV-1 RT, although the two RTs have similar incorporation rates (k(pol)). Second, compared with HIV-1 RT, MuLV RT showed dramatic reduction during multiple dNTP incorporations at low dNTP concentrations. Presumably, due to its low dNTP binding affinity, the dNTP binding step becomes rate-limiting in the multiple rounds of the dNTP incorporation by MuLV RT, especially at low dNTP concentrations. Third, similar fold differences between MuLV and HIV-1 RTs in the K(d) and k(pol) values to correct and incorrect dNTPs were observed. This indicates that these two RT proteins have similar misinsertion fidelities. Fourth, these two RT proteins have different mechanistic capabilities regarding mismatch extension. MuLV RT has a 3.1-fold lower mismatch extension fidelity, compared with HIV-1 RT. Finally, MuLV RT has a 3.8-fold lower binding affinity to mismatched template/primer (T/P) substrate compared with HIV-1 RT. Our data suggest that the active site of MuLV RT has an intrinsically low dNTP binding affinity, compared with HIV-1 RT. In addition, instead of the misinsertion step, the mismatch extension step, which varies between MuLV and HIV-1 RTs, contributes to their fidelity differences.

The research ways are mainly combination of different methods instead of integration of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The research results are mainly confirmation of traditional Chinese medical theories instead of exploration of their innate regularities. The relationship among disease, syndrome and symptom is not clearly explored. The principal-subordinate relationship between macro- and micro-differentiation of syndromes is not clear.

These master regulators of development continue to be expressed throughout adulthood in various tissues and organs. The physiological and patho-physiological functions of this network of genes are being avidly pursued within the scientific community, but defined roles for them remain elusive. The order of expression of HOX genes within a cluster is co-ordinated during development, so that the 3' genes are expressed more anteriorly and earlier than the 5' genes. Mutations in HOXA13 and HOXD13 are associated with disorders of limb formation such as hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS), synpolydactyly (SPD), and brachydactyly. Haematopoietic progenitors express HOX genes in a pattern characteristic of the lineage and stage of differentiation of the cells. In leukaemia, dysregulated HOX gene expression can occur due to chromosomal translocations involving upstream regulators such as the MLL gene, or the fusion of a HOX gene to another gene such as the nucleoporin, NUP98. Recent investigations of HOX gene expression in leukaemia are providing important insights into disease classification and prediction of clinical outcome. Whereas the oncogenic potential of certain HOX genes in leukaemia has already been defined, their role in other neoplasms is currently being studied. Progress has been hampered by the experimental approach used in many studies in which the expression of small subsets of HOX genes was analysed, and complicated by the functional redundancy implicit in the HOX gene system. Attempts to elucidate the function of HOX genes in malignant transformation will be enhanced by a better understanding of their upstream regulators and downstream target genes.",,"[""Department of Child Health, Queen's University, Belfast, Grosvenor Road, Belfast BT12 6BA, UK.""]",,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we summarize all sequence variations (mutations and polymorphisms) in FANCA described in the literature and listed in the Fanconi Anemia Mutation Database as of March 2004, and report 61 novel FANCA mutations identified in FA patients registered in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). Thirty-eight novel SNPs, previously unreported in the literature or in dbSNP, were also identified. We studied the segregation of common FANCA SNPs in FA families to generate haplotypes. We found that FANCA SNP data are highly useful for carrier testing, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, particularly when the disease-causing mutations are unknown. Twenty-two large genomic deletions were identified by detection of apparent homozygosity for rare SNPs.

The present study demonstrated its functional relevance by the impaired oxidase activity in neutrophil-like NB4 cells, after specific blockage of S100A9 expression, and bone marrow polymorphonuclear neutrophils from S100A9-/- mice. The impaired oxidase activation could also be mimicked in a cell-free system by pretreatment of neutrophil cytosol with an S100A9-specific antibody. Further analyses gave insights into the molecular mechanisms by which S100A8/A9 promoted NADPH oxidase activation. In vitro analysis of oxidase activation as well as protein-protein interaction studies revealed that S100A8 is the privileged interaction partner for the NADPH oxidase complex since it bound to p67phox and Rac, whereas S100A9 did interact with neither p67phox nor p47phox. Moreover, S100A8/A9 transferred the cofactor arachidonic acid to NADPH oxidase as shown by the impotence of a mutant S100A8/A9 complex unable to bind arachidonic acid to enhance NADPH oxidase activity.

The results revealed that both 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone (TGZ) have significant anti-proliferation- and apoptosis-inducing effects on these two kinds of leukemia cells. Marked morphological changes of cell apoptosis including condensation of chromatin and nuclear fragmentation were observed clearly using Wright's and Hoechst 33258 staining. Reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analyses demonstrated that both survivin and bcl-2 expression were downregulated markedly, while bax expression was upregulated concurrently when apoptosis occurred.

Possible inefficiency of DNA isolation and different detection methods do not allow comparable and precise quantification of SV40 in human samples. A standardized and common detection method is, therefore, essential for further routine SV40 analysis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We established a real time quantitative (RQ-) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based TaqMan assay on the LightCycler system for reproducible detection and quantification of SV40 DNA. We used 500 ng of the COS-1 cell line, containing one single integrated copy of SV40 DNA, as the quantification standard. Amplification of b-globin served as the quality control for DNA integrity. For the extraction of the episomal form of SV40 we compared a column and a precipitation-based DNA extraction method. DNA samples from 149 healthy controls, from 26 fresh frozen childhood cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (B-, BCP- and T-ALL) and from 12 paraffin-embedded osteosarcomas were investigated. RESULTS: The RQ-PCR assay had a linear amplification rate from 10 to 100,000 copies of SV40 in 500 ng genomic DNA. Very low copy numbers of SV40 DNA were detectable in 2/149 (1,3%) blood samples from healthy German controls. Various amounts of SV40 were detectable in 20/26 (77%) childhood ALL samples of German origin and, in part, high amounts were visible in 11/12 (92%) paraffin embedded Hungarian osteosarcomas. The column-based DNA isolation method allowed the detection of both, the integrated and the episomal forms of SV40. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our assay provides a standardized and reproducible quantification of SV40 DNA in a wide spectrum of specimens. Exact quantification strongly depends on the source, as well as on the quality, of the DNA used. Quantification of paraffin-embedded DNA generally leads to lower sensitivity of SV40 DNA detection. We strongly recommend this RQ-PCR assay for standardized detection of SV40.",,"[""Centre for Women's and Children's Health, Clinic and Policlinic for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. heinsohn@uke.uni-hamburg.de""]","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Jan;90(1):6.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Freshly obtained erythrocyte-lysed bone marrow samples from 150 elderly patients (> 65 years) with de novo AML and 30 younger AML patients were analyzed using a 4-color immunofluorescence technique for quantitative expression of proteins associated with apoptosis (bcl-2, bax, APO2.7) and MDR (P-gp, MRP, LRP) in 3 blast cell subpopulations, defined according to their maturation stage. RESULTS: Although a homogeneous CD34+ blast cell population was more frequent in the elderly patients, (25% vs 7%, p=0.02), no statistically significant differences were detected between the two age groups in the expression of either apoptosis- or MDR-associated proteins, except for slightly higher quantities of LRP protein in the more immature CD34+ blast cell subset in the elderly AML cases (p=0.04). Interestingly, when different blast cell populations were compared, immature (CD34+) blast cells were characterized by higher levels of bcl-2 in both age groups and lower levels of APO2.7 in the elderly group. In addition, higher P-gp levels were found in CD34+ blast cells than in CD34-- ones in elderly AML patients. Reactivity for LRP was low in both elderly and younger patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results suggest that the higher resistance to chemotherapy observed in elderly AML patients could be related to a higher incidence of cases with a CD34+ homogeneous blast cell population, since these blast cells frequently display a more pronounced anti-apoptotic and MDR1 phenotype.",,"['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,['PETHEMA Cooperative Group'],,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Jan;90(1):3.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy has significantly reduced the frequency and severity of infections, but its possible influence on the risk of malignancy is not known. DESIGN AND METHODS: The French Severe Chronic Neutropenia (SCN) Registry has prospectively collected data since 1994 on 231 patients with various forms of SCN, namely severe congenital neutropenia (n=101), cyclic neutropenia (n=60), glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb) (n=15) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS)(n=55). The median overall follow-up is 11.1 years. Parameters of exposure to G-CSF therapy, such as the time averaged dose, follow up after first use of G-CSF, and the cumulative dose, have been recorded. RESULTS: Eight septic deaths occurred, of which 6 among patients with severe congenital neutropenia and 2 in patients with cyclic neutropenia; none of these 8 patients was receiving G-CSF therapy. No septic deaths occurred during G-CSF therapy. Thirteen cases of MDS/AL were recorded. The cumulative incidence of MDS/AL was 2.7% (SD 1.3%) at 10 years and 8.1% (SD 2.7%) at 20 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for MDS/AL were the diagnostic category, the severity of neutropenia, younger age at diagnosis, and strong exposure to G-CSF. MDS/AL only occurred in patients with severe congenital neutropenia and SDS. Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup.",,"[""Service d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrique, Hopital Trousseau, Paris, France. jean.donadieu@trs.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,,['French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Study Group'],,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Jan;90(1):2-3.

Epub 2004 Nov 23.,"Artemisinin reacts with iron to form free radicals that kill cells. Since cancer cells uptake relatively large amount of iron than normal cells, they are more susceptible to the toxic effect of artemisinin. In previous research, we have shown that artemisinin is more toxic to cancer cells than to normal cells. In the present research, we covalently attached artemisinin to the iron-carrying plasma glycoprotein transferrin. Transferrin is transported into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and cancer cells express significantly more transferrin receptors on their cell surface and endocytose more transferrin than normal cells. Thus, we hypothesize that by tagging artemisinin to transferrin, both iron and artemisinin would be transported into cancer cells in one package. Once inside a cell, iron is released and can readily react with artemisinin close by tagged to the transferrin. This would enhance the toxicity and selectivity of artemisinin towards cancer cells. In this paper, we describe a method to synthesize such a compound in which transferrin was conjugated with an analog of artemisinin artelinic acid via the N-glycoside chains on the C-domain. The resulting conjugate ('tagged-compound') was characterized by MALDI-MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, chemiluminescence, and HPLC. We then tested the compound on a human leukemia cell line (Molt-4) and normal human lymphocytes. We found that holotransferrin-tagged artemisinin, when compared with artemisinin, was very potent and selective in killing cancer cells. Thus, this 'tagged-compound' could potentially be developed into an effective chemotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment.",,"['Department of Bioengineering, Box 357962, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7962, USA. hlai@u.washington.edu']","['0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (holotransferrin)', '9RMU91N5K2 (artemisinin)']",,20041123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that these deletions arise from unbalanced two- or three-way translocations, rather than from interstitial breaks or segregation errors; however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this multistep genomic instability. We have analyzed a complex rearrangement of chromosome band 5q both in the primary leukemic cells of the patient from whom the acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell line HL-60 was derived and in the HL-60 cells in culture. This highly stable rearrangement is a product of multiple events in which a small single-copy fragment flanking the 3' end of the GMCSF gene is juxtaposed to novel L1Hs sequences. The resulting genomic fragment is found inserted into a telomeric locus (D5S89), with loss of 4.1 Mbp of in-between sequences, encoding one or more candidate myeloid leukemia suppressor genes. The findings are consistent with a dynamic role for L1Hs in mediating instability that results in a complex chromosomal rearrangement.

METHODS: In a retrospective review of 200,716 women screened at the South West London Breast Screening Service (SWLBSS) over 7 years, 72 women with ALP with an otherwise normal mammogram were identified. Thirteen patients were not recalled, nine of who had a known underlying diagnosis and the remainder had longstanding unchanged mammograms. Fifty-nine patients were recalled for further clinical assessment and investigations, including ultrasound, further mammographic views, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), blood tests and a chest radiograph. Those with a definite diagnosis were referred for appropriate management and those with benign reactive cytology on FNAC reviewed at 6 weeks with subsequent referral for excision of persisting abnormal nodes. RESULTS: The ultimate diagnosis was benign in 45 cases: 26 benign reactive changes, 11 arthritides, five with dermatological and viral conditions and three with tuberculosis. Malignancy was diagnosed in 13 cases: four with metastatic breast carcinoma and nine with lymphoma/leukaemia. The total number of newly diagnosed malignancies was 20% of women recalled. Another 5% of patients had active tuberculosis. Of the 22 patients with benign reactive cytology, one had significant pathology on excision biopsy: tuberculosis. Over 95% of the results from excision biopsy in these patients did not alter management. CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients, the FNAC results were representative of the final excision pathology. The present study suggests that excision biopsy could be omitted for those patients whose FNAC and culture are negative.",,"[""St George's Hospital NHSBSP National Training Centre, Duchess of Kent Breast Screening Unit, St George's Hospital, Tooting, London, UK. toral@doctors.net.uk""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted the present study to evaluate whether systemic chemotherapy could produce microsatellite instability (MSI) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction of breast cancer patients. METHODS: We studied 119 sequential blood samples from 30 previously untreated breast cancer patients before, during and after chemotherapy. For comparison, we also evaluated 20 women who had no relevant medical history (control group). RESULTS: In 27 out of 30 patients we observed MSI in at least one sample, and six patients had loss of heterozygosity. We found a significant correlation between the number of MSI events per sample and chemotherapy with alkylating agents (P < 0.0001). We also observed an inverse correlation between the percentage of cells positive for hMSH2 and the number of MSI events per sample (P = 0.00019) and use of alkylating agents (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: We conclude that systemic chemotherapy may induce MSI and loss of heterozygosity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients receiving alkylating agents, possibly mediated by a chemotherapy-induced decrease in the expression of hMSH2. These effects may be related to the generation of secondary leukaemia in some patients, and may also intensify the genetic instability of tumours and increase resistance to treatment.",,"['ABC Foundation School of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil. ge.fonseca@uol.com.br']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",,20041104,,,,,,PMC1064099,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Nov 24.,"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play a major role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by secreting effector molecules that promote inflammation and joint destruction. How these cells become and remain activated is still elusive. Both genetic and environmental factors probably play a role in transforming FLSs into inflammatory matrix-degrading cells. As bacterial products have been detected in the joint and shown to trigger joint inflammation, this study was undertaken to investigate whether a bacterial ligand of integrin alpha5beta1, protein I/II, could contribute to the aggressive behavior of RA FLSs. Protein I/II is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) isolated from oral streptococci that have been identified in the joints of RA patients. The response of RA and osteoarthritis FLSs to protein I/II was analyzed using human cancer cDNA expression arrays. RT-PCR and pro-MMP-3 (pro-matrix metalloproteinase) assays were then performed to confirm the up-regulation of gene expression. Protein I/II modulated about 6% of all profiled genes. Three of these, those encoding IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and MMP-3, showed a high expression level in all RA FLSs tested, whereas the expression of genes encoding other members of the cytokine or MMP-family was not affected. Furthermore, the up-regulation of MMP-3 gene expression was followed by an increase of pro-MMP-3 release. The expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor-5 was also up-regulated, although the expression levels were lower. Only one gene, that for insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4, was down-regulated in all RA FLSs. In contrast, in osteoarthritis FLSs only one gene, that for IL-6, was modulated. These results suggest that a bacterial ligand of integrin alpha5beta1 may contribute to the aggressive behavior of RA FLSs by inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a cartilage-degrading enzyme, such as IL-6 and MMP-3, respectively.",,"['Inserm 392, Infection et Inflammation, Universite Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74 route du Rhin, 67400 Illkirch, France. zeisel@pharma.u-strasbg.fr']","['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (FGF5 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (protein I-II, Streptococcus mutans)', '129653-64-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)']",,20041124,,,,,,PMC1064889,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study 74 preventive fissure sealants, 69 fillings and 81 extractions along with periodontal treatment that included prophylaxis and/or scaling were performed on 124 patients with a mean age of 7.00+/-2.3. The patients were monitored for at least three weeks after the treatment for bleeding, pain, local and/or systemic infection, fever, delayed wound healing or any other complication. RESULTS: Two patients (one ALL and one HL) suffered delayed wound healing after extractions which resulted in the delay of chemotherapy.

Although, a lot of knowledge has been gained in the understanding of differentiation-specific signaling in hematopoietic (HSC) and mesenchymal (MSC) counterparts, the molecular mechanisms underlying lineage commitment in NSCs are just beginning to be understood. Furthermore, it is not well comprehended as to how the specification of one cell lineage can result in the suppression of parallel pathways in the NSCs. Thus, a thorough understanding of various signal transduction cascades activated via cytokines and growth factors, and the confounding effects of different CNS microenvironments are critically required to determine the full potential of NSCs. Our knowledge on the clonogenic ability, differentiation potential, and the inherent plasticity in both HSCs and MSCs may facilitate the understanding of lineage commitment in the NSCs as well. The information available from the marrow-derived stem cells may be extrapolated toward the similar signaling pathways in the neural precursors. From a number of previous studies, it is apparent that four distinctly different subsets of ligand-receptor superfamilies are involved in determining the fate of NSCs. These include 1) the transforming growth factor type-beta-1 (TGF-beta1) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) superfamily; 2) the platelet-derived and epidermal (PDGF/EGF) growth factors; 3) the interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (IL-6/LIF/CNTF) superfamily; and 4) the EGF-like Notch/Delta group of extracellular ligands. Ligand binding to the cell surface receptor activates the receptor's cytosolic catalytic domain and/or the receptor-associated protein-kinases, which in turn activate intracellular second messengers and different sets of transcription factors. Transcription factor oligomerization, nuclear localization, followed by their recognition of DNA elements, leads to the expression of lineage-specific genes. Association between different groups of transcription factors can also regulate their ability to transcriptionally activate different genes. The limited availability of coactivators and cosuppressors, which can sequester the transcription factor complexes toward or away from a specific gene locus, further adds to the complexity in the cross talk between different signaling cascades. Both concerted actions of temporally regulated signals and convergent effects of different signaling cascades can thus ultimately precipitate the phenotypic changes. It is beginning to be realized that in addition to the cytokines and growth factors, cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, are also important within the molecular scenario linked to both proliferation and differentiation of the stem cells. The cell surface molecules, which include cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), integrins, selectins, and the immunoglobulins, are well known to regulate HSC and MSC commitment within different tissue microenvironments and may have direct implications in understanding the NSC cell fate determination within different regions of the brain.",,"['Department of Pharmacology SL83, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.']",['0 (Cytokines)'],127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are different effects of low and high concentrations of IL-1beta on the expression level of anabolic genes (type II collagen, aggrecan), catabolic genes (matrix metalloproteinase 1 [MMP-1], MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-4), and cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF]) by articular chondrocytes (normal and osteoarthritic). Determination of whether there was a difference in reactivity between normal and osteoarthritic chondrocytes was also a goal of this study. METHODS: Gene expression levels were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction from isolated (nonpassaged) chondrocytes (normal [n = 6]; osteoarthritic [n = 7]) after stimulation with 0.01 ng, 0.1 ng, 1 ng, and 10 ng/ml IL-1beta. RESULTS: In normal adult articular chondrocytes the expression of both aggrecan and type II collagen genes was significantly down-regulated, whereas matrix-degrading proteases (except MMP-2), as well as the investigated cytokines, were induced by IL-1beta in a dose-dependent manner. The strongest regulation was found for IL-6 and LIF. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes showed strongly increased levels of catabolic enzymes and mediators, but were less responsive to further stimulation with IL-1beta. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that IL-1beta activity is critically dependent on both the applied concentration and the reactivity of the cells stimulated. The responsiveness appears to be significantly reduced in late-stage osteoarthritic chondrocytes. However, these cells show high basic expression levels of catabolic enzymes and mediators. Thus, it remains open whether our data indicate that osteoarthritic chondrocytes are per se not responsive to IL-1beta or are already so strongly stimulated (e.g., by IL-1) during the disease process that they are refractory to further stimulation.",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Krankenhausstrasse 8-10, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of proper Ig detection with simultaneous unaltered staining of further 2-3 markers on the cell surface after elimination of free plasma Ig in the whole blood sample are described. In differential diagnosis of some chronic B-cell malignancies and subclassification of some acute B-leukemias the detection of intracytoplasmic light/heavy chain Igs is required. The unique phenotypic structures of multiple myeloma (MM) cells have been utilized in our approach to detect cytoplasmic Ig light and heavy chains. A modified 2-step method for analysis of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin light chains by flow cytometry in MM patients was used and the method was extended for measurement of IgM heavy chain in B-ALL. For membrane staining in MM patients cells the combination of CD45-FITC and CD138-PE was used; the CD138 was found to be more specific than CD38 for MM cells. The whole blood cells were lysed, acquired on flow cytometry (first acquisition), then permeabilized by paraformaldehyde and saponin, and incubated with anti-kappa-FITC and anti-lambda-FITC antibodies and acquired again (second acquisition).

Zygomycosis (mucormycosis) typically occurs in patients with leukemia, with solid-organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, with diabetic ketoacidosis, in those who have received steroids or are neutropenic, and after desferioxamine therapy. Often, both diagnostic and therapeutic measures are performed too late and are inadequate. Mortality rates may be as high as 80% in infected transplant recipients. Zygomycosis also appears to have made a subtle increase in incidence: up to 8% in autopsied patients with leukemia, and 2% in allogenic bone marrow transplant patients. Most infections are acquired by inhalation, ingestion, or trauma. They rapidly infarct blood vessels, resulting in necrosis of surrounding tissue. Over the past few years, new diagnostic procedures, susceptibility tests, and drugs have entered the clinic, and these advances are discussed in the review. RECENT FINDINGS: With the rise in number of cases of 'zygomycosis', new scrutiny has been directed at the terms 'zygomycosis' and 'mucormycosis'. This review explains their differences and the attending relevance for the clinician. Diagnostic methods include new molecular detection assays and new susceptibility testing options. New treatment options will soon exist with triazole antifungal agents. The first one expected to enter clinical practice is posaconazole in 2005. Its metabolism, pharmacokinetics, in-vitro and in-vivo activity, and clinical study results are described. Finally, we present our approach to zygomycosis.

In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as an alternative for these conditions. We summarize the recent advances in gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discuss the unexpected occurrence of leukemia in a gene therapy trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight of 10 infants with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the IL2RG complementary DNA achieved immune reconstitution. However, the two youngest patients developed leukemic expansions of gene-corrected cells. The first case had proliferation of a gamma delta T cell clone, and the second case had three alpha beta T cell clones derived from a single transduced progenitor. Leukemic cells in both patients aberrantly expressed the LIM domain only-2 transcription factor due to retroviral vector insertions in this locus. After receiving anti-leukemic treatment one patient achieved a lasting remission, but the other relapsed. Four adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency patients also developed functional immunity after receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the adenosine deaminase gene complementary DNA following submyeloablative chemotherapy. Chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, JAK3 deficiency and RAG2 deficiency are other immunodeficiencies being studied as candidates for gene therapy. SUMMARY: Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option for some primary immunodeficiencies, especially when cells expressing the correct gene have a selective advantage. More clinical trials with closer patient monitoring are under way to define which patients may benefit from this approach, and strategies are being developed to understand and ultimately reduce the risk of leukemia secondary to retroviral vector insertion.",,"['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)'],39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, it has become increasingly appreciated that heat shock may induce cross-tolerance to a variety of stimuli based on in vitro and in vivo models. Circulating peripheral blood monocytes are key mediators of cytokine release following endotoxin challenge. The mitogen-activated protein kinases play a key role in the transcriptional regulation of this response including expression of tumor necrosis factor. As such, counterregulatory phosphatases that target mitogen-activated protein kinase may play a role in this heat shock-mediated effect. We hypothesized that prior heat shock to monocytes would induce a phosphatase, MKP-1, that regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and subsequently conferred cross-tolerance to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. DESIGN: Experimental. SETTING: University research foundation laboratory. SUBJECTS: THP-1 human monocyte cell line. INTERVENTIONS: THP-1 cells were exposed to either heat shock (43 degrees C, 1 hr) or normothermia (37 degrees C, 1 hr) and allowed to recover before stimulation with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Induction of a heat shock response was determined by heat shock protein-70 expression. Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to assess heat shock inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced gene expression. The effect of heat shock on lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of the p38 and ERK kinases was examined by measuring phospho-specific isoforms of p38 and ERK1/2 and correlated to in vitro kinase activity. Confirmatory data were generated from experiments employing either pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of MKP-1. Heat shock induced the nuclear localized phosphatase, MKP-1, that attenuated p38 and ERK kinase activity resulting in significantly diminished tumor necrosis factor expression in response to lipopolysaccharide. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of heat shock on decreasing the tumor necrosis factor response to lipopolysaccharide is conferred by induction of MKP-1, which negatively regulates p38 and ERK kinases.

Print 2005.,"DNA microarray technology provides a promising approach to the diagnosis and prognosis of tumors on a genome-wide scale by monitoring the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. One problem arising from the use of microarray data is the difficulty to analyze the high-dimensional gene expression data, typically with thousands of variables (genes) and much fewer observations (samples), in which severe collinearity is often observed. This makes it difficult to apply directly the classical statistical methods to investigate microarray data. In this paper, total principal component regression (TPCR) was proposed to classify human tumors by extracting the latent variable structure underlying microarray data from the augmented subspace of both independent variables and dependent variables. One of the salient features of our method is that it takes into account not only the latent variable structure but also the errors in the microarray gene expression profiles (independent variables). The prediction performance of TPCR was evaluated by both leave-one-out and leave-half-out cross-validation using four well-known microarray datasets. The stabilities and reliabilities of the classification models were further assessed by re-randomization and permutation studies. A fast kernel algorithm was applied to decrease the computation time dramatically.

The mechanism by which MEN1 acts as a tumor suppressor is unclear. We have recently shown that menin, the MEN1 protein product, interacts with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) family proteins in a histone methyltransferase complex including Ash2, Rbbp5, and WDR5. Here, we show that menin directly regulates expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27Kip1 and p18Ink4c. Menin activates transcription by means of a mechanism involving recruitment of MLL to the p27Kip1 and p18Ink4c promoters and coding regions. Loss of function of either MLL or menin results in down-regulation of p27Kip1 and p18Ink4c expression and deregulated cell growth. These findings suggest that regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor transcription by cooperative interaction between menin and MLL plays a central role in menin's activity as a tumor suppressor.",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']","['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,20050107,,,,,,PMC545577,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-utility of imatinib mesylate compared with hydroxyurea in patients with chronic-phase CML for whom first-line treatment with interferon-alpha failed to produce a response. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression for hypothetical patients receiving imatinib mesylate or hydroxyurea, who had not previously responded to interferon-a therapy, to determine outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service. Patient data were derived from previously published trials. RESULTS: The Markov model simulated the transitions of a hypothetical sample of 1000 chronic-phase CML patients using 1 monthly cycle over the lifetime of the patient sample. Median survival rates were estimated to be 77 months for imatinib mesylate-treated patients and 56 months for hydroxyurea-treated patients. Patients receiving imatinib mesylate accrued 5.95 QALYs, whereas hydroxyurea-treated patients accrued 3.49 QALYs. The estimated per-patient lifetime costs were 110,103 pound sterlings for patients in the imatinib mesylate group and 15,566 pound sterlings for patients in the hydroxyurea group (year-2001 values). The estimated year-2001 incremental cost per QALY gained from using imatinib mesylate compared with hydroxyurea in chronic phase CML was 38,468 pound sterlings. CONCLUSIONS: In the present model analysis, imatinib mesylate as a second-line treatment for patients with chronic phase CML was found to offer considerable health benefits to patients, but at a cost to the payer. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 38,468 pound sterlings (year-2001 values).",,"['School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK S1 4DA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This syndrome can be observed before any treatment because of spontaneous tumoral cellular death, and is generally worsened when chemotherapy is initiated. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Although TLS is primarily observed during therapy of acute leukemia, Burkitt's lymphomas and lymphoblastic lymphomas, it can also be observed in other hematological malignancies and during the treatment of rare solid tumors. Important progress has recently been made in the management of TLS. The use of urate oxydase can rapidly control TLS induced hyperuricemia, which help to prevent the risk of calcium phosphate crystal precipitation. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: A global strategy for the management of SLT, combining adapted hydration, urate oxydase, and a close cooperation between intensive care units and hematology units can control this complication in most of the patients. The early management of TLS can, indeed, have an impact on the global therapy of these patients who need to be treated with high-dose anti-cancer agents with renal elimination.",,"['Departement de medecine, institut Gustave-Roussy, 39, rue C -Desmoulins, 94 805 Villejuif, France.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",25,,,Traitement actuel du syndrome de lyse tumorale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCL11A is a transcriptional repressor that binds directly to a GC-rich motif and is also recruited to a promoter template via interaction with the orphan nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II. In both cases, BCL11A-mediated transcriptional repression is only minimally reversed by trichostatin A, suggesting the possible lack of involvement of class I or II histone deacetylases. Nonetheless, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that expression of BCL11A in mammalian cells resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and/or H4 that were associated with the promoter region of a reporter gene. BCL11A-mediated transcriptional repression, as well as deacetylation of histone H3/H4 in BCL11A-transfected cells, was partially reversed by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of class III histone deacetylases such as SIRT1.

We thus characterized the sensitivity of ATLL cells to TRAIL in this study. Although most primary ATLL cells and cell lines expressed TRAIL death receptors on their surface, they showed only restricted sensitivity to TRAIL. Among the 10 ATLL cell lines examined, one was sensitive, but two had insufficient death-receptor expression, two had an unknown resistant mechanism with abrogation of the death signal upstream of caspase-8, and the remaining five showed attenuation of the signal in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL respectively. Furthermore, the level of HTLV-I tax expression was significantly correlated to TRAIL resistance. Interestingly, ATLL cells themselves expressed TRAIL on the cell surface. Constitutive production of TRAIL may offer resistance, thus allowing the development of TRAIL-resistant ATLL cells. Consequently, the resistant mechanism in ATLL cells against TRAIL was assigned to multiple factors and was not explained by a definitive single agent.",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Japan.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that cytokines play a role in the development and in the neoplastic cell growth of ATL. However, the precise mechanism involved in this process still remains unclear. Interleukin-21 (IL-21) and its receptor (IL-21R) have been recently described. In this study, we examined the expression of IL-21R and the effect of IL-21 on ATL cells. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that HTLV-I-infected cell lines and primary ATL cells expressed IL-21R mRNA. Cell surface expression of IL-21R on these cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis using a newly developed monoclonal antibody against human IL-21R. In contrast to the expression of IL-21R, IL-21 mRNA was scarcely detectable in these cells. Notably, IL-21 induced the proliferation of ATL-43T and ED-40515(+) cells, both of which were derived from leukaemic cell clones of ATL. Concerning the intracellular signalling pathways, IL-21 activated the phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that ATL cells express functional IL-21R, suggesting that it may contribute to the pathophysiology of ATL.

In addition, certain histological subtypes are associated with particularly poor prognoses with combination chemotherapy alone (e.g. mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia). Relatively few of these patients can achieve long-term responses. Other NHL subtypes, whilst associated with more favourable prognoses in terms of overall survival, are rarely, if ever, cured (e.g. most low grade NHL including follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma). For these reasons dose escalation and allogeneic transplantation have been investigated as potential ways of improving outcome, although this has mainly been in the setting of advanced disease.

Problems remain over progenitor cell mobilization and one study has raised anxieties about post-transplant myelodysplasia. The impact of ASCT in CLL will only be properly ascertained in a randomized clinical trial and this in underway in Europe. Initial results of conventional allogeneic transplantation (allo-SCT) were very disappointing, with an unacceptably high mortality, but did show that cure was possible in some patients. The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning has limited the early transplant-related mortality but it remains too early to determine what proportion of patients will be cured. In view of these uncertainties, is important that reduced intensity allo-SCT for CLL is conducted in the context of a clinical trial.

In this review, we have tried to re-evaluate the safety issues related to the use of retroviral vectors in human clinical trials and to suggest possible appropriate solutions to the issues. As revealed by the X-SCID incident, oncogenesis caused by retroviral insertional activation of host genes is one of the most prominent risks. An ultimate solution to this problem will be in re-engineering retroviral vectors so that the retroviral insertion takes place only at the desired specific sites of the host cell chromosome. This is, however, a technically demanding tasks, and it will take years to develop retroviral vectors with targeted insertion capability. In the mean time, the use of chromatin insulators can reduce chances for retrovirus-mediated oncogenesis by inhibiting non-specific activation of nearby cellular proto-oncogenes. Co-transduction of a suicidal gene under the control of an inducible promoter could also be one of the important safety features, since destruction of transduced cells can be triggered if abnormal growth is observed. Additionally, conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells via the combination of targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, and targeted local administration will increase the overall safety of the retroviral systems. Finally, splitting of the viral genome, use of self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors, or complete removal of the coding sequences for gag, pol, and env genes is desirable to virtually eliminate the possibility of generation of replication competent retroviruses (RCR).",,"['TissueGene Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 20877, USA.']",,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of these agents is known to be able to prime HL-60 cells and accelerate subsequently induced myeloid or monocytic differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest, suggesting that they have equal or identical cellular targets relevant to the early stages of inducing cell differentiation and G0 arrest. As a test of this possibility, a survey of protein expression changes induced by RA, BrdU, or Delta 205 transfection was performed. Retinoic acid induced numerous changes within h. Bromodeoxyuridine caused larger numbers of changes, whereas Delta 205 caused a more limited number. Among the hundreds of affected proteins detected, there were comparable numbers of up- or downregulated proteins. A small number changed between undetectable and detectable expression. The affected proteins were not restricted to a single functional class and included transcription factors, receptors, signaling molecules, cytoskeletal molecules, and effectors of various cellular processes such as deoxyribonucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation. The intersect of the sets of proteins affected by RA, BrdU, and Delta 205 was identified to determine if these agents regulated a common subset of proteins. This ensemble contained the commonly upregulated proteins AF6, ABP-280, ENC-1, ESE 1, MAP2B, NTF2, casein kinase, IRF1, SRPK2, Rb2, RhoGDI, P47phox, CD45, PKR, and SIIIp15. The commonly downregulated proteins were SHC, katanin, flotillin-2/ESA, EB 1, p43/EMAPIIprecursor, Jab1, FNK. The composition of the ensemble suggested three apparent themes for cellular processes that were affected early. The themes reflected the ultimate fate of the treated precursor cells as a mature myeloid cell, namely a cell whose hallmarks are (1) motility to migrate to a target and phagocytize it, (2) inducible oxidative metabolism to reduce the target with superoxide from a respiratory burst, and (3) biosynthetic slow down consistent with conversion from cell proliferation to quiescence. Interestingly, RA appears to induce aspects of an interferon-like response of potential significance as part of a biosynthetic slow down leading to cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, three biologically disparate ways to prime cells to differentiate were used to filter out a small ensemble of commonly regulated proteins that group as either microtubule associated, oxidative metabolism machinery, or effectors of cellular responses to interferon.",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']","['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene transcription in the GC-treated cells is required for subsequent apoptosis, but only a few of the actual genes involved have been identified. We employed gene microarray analysis to find the network of genes involved in GC-evoked cell death, using three clones derived from the CEM lymphoid leukemia cell line. Clone C1-15 was resistant to GC-evoked apoptosis, although not necessarily to GC-induced gene transcription; the other two underwent apoptosis in the presence of GC. Clone C7-14 was subcloned from the apoptosis-sensitive parental C7 clone to establish karyotypic uniformity. The second sensitive clone, C1-6, was a spontaneous revertant from parental resistant clone C1. A period of > or = 24 h in the constant presence of receptor-occupying concentrations of synthetic GC dexamethasone (Dex) was necessary for apoptosis to begin. To identify the steps leading to this dramatic event, we identified the changes in gene expression in the 20-h period preceding the onset of overt apoptosis. Cells in the log phase of growth were treated with 10(-6) M Dex, and 2-20 h later, mRNA was prepared and analyzed using the Affymetrix HG_U95Av2 chip, containing probes for about 12,600 genes. Of these, approximately 6,000 were expressed above background. Comparisons of the basal and expressed genes in the three clones led to several conclusions: The Dex-sensitive clones shared the regulation of a limited set of genes. The apoptosis-resistant clone C1-15 showed Dex effects on a largely different set of genes.

Expression of Pgp in the cells prevents them to be loaded with the fluorescent marker. To detect the activity of Pgp, verapamil (Ver) or cyclosporine A (CsA) has to be used as Pgp inhibitors. Multidrug resistance protein (MRP), another drug efflux pump, may be inhibited by probenecid (Pro), i.e, the inhibitor of a wide variety of anion transporters.

Epub 2005 Jan 6.,"Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that suppresses the growth of bcr-abl-expressing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitor cells by blockade of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the kinase domain of bcr-abl. Imatinib also inhibits the c-abl, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, abl-related gene (ARG) and stem-cell factor (SCF) receptor tyrosine kinases, and has been used clinically to inhibit the growth of malignant cells in patients with CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Although initially considered to have minimal effects of normal hematopoiesis, recent studies show that imatinib also inhibits the growth of some nonmalignant hematopoietic cells, including monocyte/macrophages. This inhibition could not be attributed to the known activity profile of imatinib. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that imatinib targets the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor c-fms. Phosphorylation of c-fms was inhibited by therapeutic concentrations of imatinib, and this was not due to down-regulation in c-fms expression. Imatinib was also found to inhibit M-CSF-induced proliferation of a cytokine-dependent cell line, further supporting the hypothesis that imatinib affects the growth and development of monocyte and/or macrophages through inhibition of c-fms signaling.

Overall, CR was obtained in 81 (89%) patients; relapse rate was 62% at 4 years and overall survival (OS) rate was 38%. CR rate was significantly lower in IM T-ALL patients after 1 course (45% vs 87%; P < .001) and after salvage (74% vs 97%; P = .002), with the latter inducing a higher rate of CR (9 [64%] of 14) than initial induction. Once CR was obtained, cumulative relapse rates were similar for IM, pre-alphabeta, and TCR+ T-ALL patients (P = .51), but were higher in HOX11L2 (83%) and SIL-TAL1 (82%) T-ALL patients compared with other genetic subgroups (48%; P = .05).

We tested the effect of long-term culture, subcloning, and generation of drug-resistant subclones on fingerprinting profiles in four widely used leukemia cell lines. The DNA fingerprinting profile remained unaltered in two of them (U937 and K562) throughout 12 months in culture, and the vast majority of subclones derived therefrom by limiting dilution after long-term culture revealed the same profile, indicating a high degree of stability and clonotypic homogeneity. In contrast, two other cell lines (CCRF-CEM and Jurkat) showed marked alterations in DNA fingerprinting profiles during long-term culture. Limiting dilution subcloning revealed extensive clonotypic heterogeneity with subclones differing in up to eight STR loci from the parental culture. Similar heterogeneity was observed in subclones generated by selection culture for drug resistance where DNA fingerprinting proved useful in identifying possible resistance mechanisms. Thus, common tissue culture procedures may dramatically affect the fingerprinting profile of certain cell lines and thus render definition of their origin difficult.",,"['Institute of Legal Medicine, Department Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,20050106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the function of PRAM-1, we have undertaken the identification of its partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. Here, we show that the proline-rich domain of PRAM-1 interacted with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK-1)-interacting protein of 55 kDa (HIP-55, also called SH3P7 and Abp1) known to stimulate the activity of HPK-1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Overexpression of PRAM-1 in the NB4 APL cell line increased arsenic trioxide-induced JNK activation through a caspase 3-like-dependent activity. Dissociation of the SH3 domain from the rest of the HIP-55 protein was observed in the NB4 APL cell line treated with arsenic trioxide due to specific cleavage by caspase 3-like enzymes. The cleavage of HIP-55 correlated with the induction of PRAM-1 mRNA and protein expression. Taken together, our results suggest that the caspase 3-cleaved SH3 domain of HIP-55 is likely involved in PRAM-1-mediated JNK activation upon arsenic trioxide-induced differentiation of NB4 cells.",,"['Hopital Robert Debre, INSERM U417, 48 Boulevard Serurier, F-75935 Paris, Cedex 19, France.']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DBNL protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PRAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,20050106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the roles of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins in TRAIL apoptosis remain elusive. Here we showed that, besides the specific cleavage and activation of Bid by caspase-8 and caspase-3, TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells required the specific cleavage of Mcl-1 at Asp-127 and Asp-157 by caspase-3, while other prototypic antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) seemed not to be affected. Mutation at Asp-127 and Asp-157 of Mcl-1 led to cellular resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In sharp contrast to cycloheximide-induced Mcl-1 dilapidation, TRAIL did not activate proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 in Jurkat cells. We further established for the first time that the C-terminal domain of Mcl-1 became proapoptotic as a result of caspase-3 cleavage, and its physical interaction and cooperation with tBid, Bak, and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 promoted mitochondrial apoptosis. These results suggested that removal of N-terminal domains of Bid by caspase-8 and Mcl-1 by caspase-3 enabled the maximal mitochondrial perturbation that potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis.",,"['Center for Molecular Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 100080.']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Bid protein, rat)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, rat)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,20050106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the cytogenetic response is associated a longer survival. Today is interferon alpha considered to be the first line treatment in those patients with chronic myeloic leukaemia, who are not candidates for alogenic bone marrow transplantation. The combination with cytosinarabinoside can reduce the number of Ph positive metaphases. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-three previously untreated patients with CML in chronic phase were randomly assigned to receive either IFN alpha 2 b (5MU sqm/daily) or IFN alpha 2 b in the same dosage plus monthly courses of low-dose AraC. The aim were complete hematologic remission at 6 months and cytogenetic response at 12 months. RESULTS: A complete hematologic remission occured in 61.9% patients with single IFN alpha 2 b and in 78.9% patients with combination therapy. A cytogenetic response was present in 28.5% and in 42.2% patients with combination therapy. One of 21 patients treated with IFNalpha/AraC therapy achieved complete (5.2%), 4 partial (21%) and 3 minor (16%) cytogenetic response. The side effects were more significant in the group receiving combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on published data that shows a survival advantage for patients who achieved any cytogenetic response and high rate of cytogenetic response which we observed in our population we believe that IFN plus AraC regimen could be a front-line therapy for CML.",,"['Klinika hematologie FNsP, Kosice, Slovenska republika.']","['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,Studia 6M 12M--Ucinnost' a tolerancia liecby chronickej myeloickej leukemie kombinaciou interferonu alfa s cytosinarabinosidom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine whether head and neck squamous cell carcinomas can be made more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of CPA by shifting the balance from the degradative to the activation pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human SCC-25 squamous carcinoma cells were transfected by adenoviral vector containing P-450 2B1 gene and were identified for P-450 2B1 expression by Northern blot analysis. In vitro cytotoxic assay after CPA exposure was performed using these cells. Human KB oral base squamous cell carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously to the backs of nude mice. Then Ad.CMV-P-450 2B1 was injected intratumorally. At 48 hours after the injection of Ad.CMV-P-450 2B1, CPA was injected into the peritoneal cavity of the animals and the volume of the tumor was determined with the passage of time. All the animal procedures were performed under the guidance of the committee in our animal care facility. RESULTS: The in vitro experiments found that transduction of the P-450 2B1 gene caused a nearly 30-fold increase in the sensitivity of the host cell line to CPA on the basis of the 50% inhibitory concentration. The in vivo experiments, which were conducted in nude mice, found that the combination of P-450 2B1 gene transduction and administration of CPA showed an inhibitory effect on tumor growth.

We utilized a conditional knockin strategy to bypass the embryonic lethality caused by MLL-CBP expression and to assess the immediate effects of induced MLL-CBP expression on hematopoiesis. Within days of activating MLL-CBP, the fusion protein selectively expanded granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) and enhanced their self-renewal/proliferation. MLL-CBP altered the gene expression program of GMP, upregulating a subset of genes including Hox a9. Inhibition of Hox a9 expression by RNA interference demonstrated that MLL-CBP required Hox a9 for its enhanced cell expansion. Following exposure to sublethal gamma-irradiation or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), MLL-CBP mice developed myelomonocytic hyperplasia and progressed to fatal myeloproliferative disorders. These represented the spectrum of therapy-induced acute myelomonocytic leukemia/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia/myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder similar to that seen in humans possessing the t(11;16). This model of MLL-CBP therapy-related myeloproliferative disease demonstrates the selectivity of this MLL fusion for GMP cells and its ability to initiate leukemogenesis in conjunction with cooperating mutations.",,"['Department of Pathology and Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)']",,20050106,"['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC545811,,,,['GENBANK/S66385'],,,,,,,,

DESIGN: This descriptive study used a self-report questionnaire. SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of parents of 505 chronically ill children and adolescents seen in subspecialty medical clinics in Salt Lake City, UT. The medical conditions studied included asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, cancer, liver and renal transplantations, seizures, and rheumatological and neurobehavioral disorders. Statistics Sample characteristics were described using frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. chi 2 tests were used to compare sex, ethnicity, parental education level, and dietary supplement use variations among the various diagnostic categories. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to determine differences among diagnosis groups for continuous variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test categorical variables. RESULTS: The population sampled was predominately white (88.5%), with a mean age of 9.9+/-5.3 years. Sixty-two percent of the population used dietary supplements, and 30% used nonprescribed supplements. Significant differences were noted among diagnosis groups, with the highest nonprescribed use reported in children with cancer (solid tumors=46%; leukemia=44%), cystic fibrosis (35%), neurobehavioral disorders (35%), and rheumatological disorders (34%). Only 20% of those using nonprescribed dietary supplements had discussed this use with the health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplement use is prevalent among chronically ill children, especially among those with a poor prognosis or for whom there are limited medical treatments. Few pediatric health care providers are aware of their patients' use of nonprescribed supplements. This is a concern because of the unknown effects of many supplements on growth and development and the potential for adverse drug interactions.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Room 2A244 SOM, 50 N Medical Drive, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Jan 5.,"The extrinsic signaling pathways responsible for the formation and maintenance of the unique laminar organization of the forebrain germinal zones are largely unknown. In the present study, we asked whether ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/gp130 signaling plays a role in the development of the germinal layers in the lateral ganglionic eminence. We found that CNTF/LIF/gp130 receptor signaling promotes the self-renewal/expansion of a subpopulation of fibroblast growth factor-responsive ventricular zone (VZ) precursors in the ventral forebrain. Analysis of Lifr-/- mice suggests that CNTF/LIF/gp130 signaling maintains a subpopulation of GSH2+ VZ precursors, which are necessary for normal growth of the early ventral forebrain and for maintaining a gradient of VZ precursor differentiation in the lateral ganglionic eminence, as defined by GSH2, MASH1 and DLX2 expression. Furthermore, addition of exogenous CNTF to embryonic forebrain explant cultures deprived of choroid plexus-derived CNTF, was sufficient to promote a VZ differentiation gradient. In contrast to the forebrain, CNTF/LIF/gp130 signaling reduced, rather than enhanced, precursor self-renewal/expansion in the spinal cord.

However, the primary dose-limiting side effect is liver toxicity. We have reproduced liver toxicity in rats using the rodent cell-tropic DT-murine GMCSF (DT390mGMCSF). Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were elevated 15- and 4-fold, respectively, in DT390mGMCSF-treated rats relative to controls. Histologic analysis revealed hepatocyte swelling; however, this did not lead to hepatic necrosis or overt histopathologic changes in the liver. Immunohistochemical staining showed apoptotic cells in the sinusoids, and depletion of cells expressing the monocyte/macrophage markers, ED1 and ED2, indicating that Kupffer cells (KC) are targets of DT390mGMCSF. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells seemed intact. In vitro, DT390mGMCSF was directly cytotoxic to primary KC but not hepatocytes. Two related fusion toxins, DT388GMCSF, which targets the human GMCSF receptor, and DT390mIL-3, which targets the rodent IL-3 receptor, induced a less than 2-fold elevation in serum transaminases and did not deplete KC in vivo. In addition, DTU2mGMCSF, a modified form of DT390mGMCSF with enhanced tumor cell specificity, was not hepatotoxic and was significantly less toxic to KC in vivo and in vitro. These results show that DT390mGMCSF causes liver toxicity by targeting KC, and establish a model for studying how this leads to hepatocyte injury.

By indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase imaging and with gel filtration column chromatography, we observed rapid aggregation at the cell surface and the appearance of high molecular weight protein complexes primarily involving DR3, and DR3 and DR4 after camptothecin and VP-16 treatment, respectively. Both drugs failed to rapidly promote FAS aggregation in these cells. The high expression level of SODD or of dominant negative forms of FADD (FADD-DN) and DAP3 (DAP3-DN), or of NH2-terminal deletion mutant of TRADD (TRADD-ND) achieved by transient transfection experiments, did not impair the kinetics of apoptosis after camptothecin and VP-16 treatment in HL-60 and U937 cells. Taken together, these observations suggested that camptothecin and VP-16 induced rapid aggregation of DR4 and DR3, but paradoxically, the importance of these events in signaling apoptosis is uncertain, because the kinetics of apoptosis were unaffected, even in the presence of a high expression level of SODD, FADD-DN, TRADD-ND, and DAP3-DN. However, camptothecin or VP-16 treatment in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) substantially accelerated kinetics of apoptosis than treatment with camptothecin, VP-16, or TRAIL alone. In contrast, cotreatment of camptothecin or VP-16 with TWEAK or TL1A did not facilitate apoptosis in HL60 cells. These findings suggest that DR4 aggregation mediated by camptothecin or VP-16 could represent a mean that accelerates TRAIL-induced apoptosis.",,"[""Centre de recherche, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal-Hopital Notre-Dame, and Institut du cancer de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAG4 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF25 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF15 protein, human)', '0 (TWEAK Receptor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 15)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used an ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay to assess the ex vivo sensitivity of a variety of solid tumors (n = 90) and a CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line selected with XR5944. Differences in gene expression between the parental CCRF-CEM and the resistant subline were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Immunohistochemistry for topoisomerases I and IIalpha and multidrug resistance (MDR1) protein was done on those tumors for which tissue was available (n = 32). The CCRF-CEM XR5944 line showed increased mRNA levels of MDR1, major vault protein, and MDR-associated protein 1 compared with the parental line, whereas the expression of topoisomerases I, IIalpha, and IIbeta was essentially unchanged, suggesting that XR5944 is susceptible to MDR mechanisms. The median IC90 and IC50 values for XR5944 in tumor-derived cells were 68 and 26 nmol/L, respectively, 6-fold greater than in resistant cell lines. XR5944 was 40- to 300-fold more potent than the other cytotoxics tested, such as doxorubicin, topotecan, and paclitaxel. Breast and gynecologic malignancies were most sensitive to XR5944, whereas gastrointestinal tumors showed greater resistance. A positive correlation (r = 0.68; P < 0.0001) was found between the IC50 values of XR5944 and P-glycoprotein/MDR1 staining but not with either topoisomerase I or IIalpha immunohistochemistry index.

The development of peptide delivery systems based on protein transduction domains has recently gained attention as a means of potentially overcoming these impediments. Here, we present a novel peptide transporter system that increases the efficiency of peptide delivery more than 10 times compared with the previous methods. The transporter, Wr-T, has an enlarged hydrophobic pocket consisting of triple tryptophan-rich domains fused with nine d-enantiomer polyarginines (r9) via Gly-Pro-Gly spacer, which serves to augment delivery of a cargo peptide. Wr-T-mediated transport of p16(INK4a) functional peptide dramatically inhibits growth of highly aggressive leukemia/lymphomas by up to 80% through restoration of p16 function. The Wr-T system thus represents a highly effective approach to cargo peptide delivery with the potential for substantially developing p16 peptide-based therapy for hematopoietic malignancies.",,"['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan. ekondo@md.okayama-u.ac.jp']","['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas individual treatment of U266 myeloma cells with 10 micromol/L HA14-1 or 100 nmol/L flavopiridol had little effect, exposure of cells to flavopiridol (6 hours) followed by HA14-1 (18 hours) resulted in a striking increase in mitochondrial dysfunction (cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release; loss of mitochondrial membrane potential), activation of the caspase cascade, apoptosis, and diminished clonogenic survival. Similar findings were noted in other myeloma cell lines (e.g., MM.1S, RPMI8226, and NCI-H929) as well as in those resistant to dexamethasone and cytotoxic agents (e.g., MM.1R, 8226/Dox40, and 8226/LR5). Combined exposure to flavopiridol and HA14-1 was associated with down-regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, Bid cleavage, and mitochondrial translocation of Bax. Flavopiridol/HA14-1-treated cells also exhibited a pronounced activation of Jun NH2-terminal kinase, a modest activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and down-regulation of cyclin D1. Flavopiridol/HA14-1-induced apoptosis was associated with a marked increase in reactive oxygen species generation; moreover,both events were attenuated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Finally, in contrast to dexamethasone, flavopiridol/HA14-1-induced lethality was unaffected by exogenous interleukin-6 or insulin-like growth factor-I. Together, these findings indicate that flavopiridol and the small-molecule Bcl-2 antagonist HA14-1 cooperate to trigger oxidant injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, and apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells and suggest that this approach may warrant further evaluation as an antimyeloma strategy.",,"['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The p56lck sequence appeared highly homologous to that of the oncogene p60c-src as did its exon-intron organisation. These data have suggested the lck gene originates from the ancestral src gene by the exon-shuffling mechanism. However, and in spite of this relationship with the p60src oncogene which is often implicated in human cancers, p56lck does not appear involved in lymphoproliferative diseases, either by overexpression or activating mutations. Nevertheless, its aberrant expression has been reported in some carcinomas (colon, lung and mammary). This unexpected expression of a lymphoid-specific protein in solid tumors remained enigmatic until recent studies. In this review, we report these data and explain the possible mechanisms which could lead to the p56lck ectopic expression. We also discuss of signalling pathways which could be affected by the abnormal presence of the p56lck in these tumoral epithelial cells.

METHODS: [Ca(2+)]i of NB4 cells and cortex neurons was probed with Fluo-3/AM, its changes were assayed with laser confocal microscopy in real-time after As2O3 treatment at different concentrations, the effects of PTK and PTP and the activation of PKC on these changes with confocal microscopy and phosphorus radioisotope assay. DNA ladders of NB4 cells and cortex neurons after exposed to As2O3 were observed. RESULTS: As2O3 at 1 micromol/L could remarkably increase the [Ca(2+)]i of NB4 cells but had no effects on neurons. Vanadate, a kind of PTP inhibitor, could promote the increase of [Ca(2+)]i treated by 2, 5, 10 micromol/L As2O3 in a dose-dependent manner. The mean total increase rates at 240 seconds after exposed to As2O3 at different concentrations were (6.5 +/- 2.3)%, (21.7 +/- 2.1)%, (49.2 +/- 2.5)% for NB4 cells, and (6.7 +/- 2.1)%, (19.4 +/- 2.5)%, (52.3 +/- 2.7)% for cortex neurons, respectively. Genistein, a kind of PTK inhibitor, could decrease the increase of [Ca(2+)]i treated by 2, 5, 10 micromol/L As2O3 in a dose-dependent manner. The mean total inhibited rates at 240 seconds after As2O3 treatment at different concentrations were (6.7 +/- 2.9)%, (25.6 +/- 2.5)%, (52.2 +/- 3.5)% for NB4 cells, and (7.8 +/- 3.1)%, (18.1 +/- 2.8)%, (51.3 +/- 3.3)% for cortex neurons, respectively. The activation of PKC began to increase as exposed to As2O3 at 1 micromol/L for 3 h, and kept rising continuously in NB4 cells and at 24 h DNA ladders emerged. However, none of the above results was found in human cortex neurons, but when exposed to 2 micromol/L As2O3, the activation of PKC and DNA ladders did emerge in neurons. CONCLUSIONS: The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PTK and PTP participated in nonspecific apoptosis signal transduction pathway related to As2O3, and accompanied with PKC activation.

METHODS: The ATRA sensitive and resistant APL cell lines, NB4 and NB4-R1, were used as in vitro models. The effects of specific inhibitors and activators of adenylate cyclase (AC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) on ATRA-induced differentiation was evaluated by cell morphology, cell surface antigen expression and nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assays. RESULTS: SQ22536, a specific antagonist of AC, could dramatically block ATRA-induced NB4 cell differentiation. When ATRA + SQ22536 group compared with ATRA group, the positivity of CD11b decreased from (95.9 +/- 2.5)% to (60.3 +/- 7.1)%, while the A(540) in NBT reduction assay decreased from 0.585 +/- 0.092 to 0.170 +/- 0.028 (P < 0.05). Forskolin, an agonist of AC, could overcome the resistance of NB4-R1 cells to ATRA. When ATRA + forskolin group compared with ATRA group, the positivity of CD11b increased from (34.3 +/- 5.3)% to (94.6 +/- 2.4)%, while the A(540) in NBT reduction assay increased from 0.110 +/- 0.028 to 0.395 +/- 0.049 (P < 0.05). In contrast, the specific antagonist and agonist of PDE, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and calmodulin, exerted little impact on ATRA treatment.

RESULTS: The expression of VEGF and KDR protein in remission patients was 5.3 (3.3 - 9.0) and 2.0 (1.0 - 4.0) being significantly lower than newly diagnosed untreated patients 6.0 (3.3 - 12.0) and 5.3 (3.3 - 8.0) (P < 0.05, 0.01).

METHODS: The results of FNAC from 65 cases of extramedullary leukemic infiltration were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: In the 65 cases studied, there were 24 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 25 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 6 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 10 cases of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CML). The commonest site of infiltration was lymph node, which accounted for 73.8% of all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate cytologic diagnosis of extramedullary leukemic infiltration relies on detailed morphologic assessment as well as correlation with clinical examination and other relevant laboratory findings, especially in patients whose initial symptom being a local mass. Leukemic infiltration, which represents proliferation of primitive cells, should be distinguished from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

This form of regional chemotherapy has led to effective treatment of occult and overt meningeal leukaemia in humans. In contrast, the efficacy of this therapy is extremely limited in the treatment of leptomeningeal dissemination of various solid tumours. Pharmacokinetic studies of the commonly intraventricularly applied anticancer agents in humans have demonstrated that, using low drug doses, very high drug concentrations can be achieved in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and relatively high concentrations in the leptomeninges but not in the brain tissue and the plasma. Therefore, this approach is not an effective treatment for bulky disease of brain tissue, and results in minimal systemic toxicity. In comparison with intralumbar administration, lower interpatient variability of CSF drug concentrations and improved clinical efficacy were observed. 'Concentration x time' schedules, i.e. frequent small drug doses over a short period, enable long-term CSF exposure to cytotoxic drug concentrations while avoiding excessively high and potentially neurotoxic drug concentrations. The technique of ventriculolumbar cerebrospinal perfusion delivers continuously high drug concentrations throughout the CSF for several hours, but its widespread use is limited by the technical complexities of this approach. In this article, the dosages, schedules and pharmacokinetic data of routinely used intraventricular agents in humans, e.g. methotrexate, cytarabine, glucocorticoids and thiotepa, are outlined in detail. In addition, pharmacokinetic data of investigational agents for intraventricular administration (diaziquone, DTC 101, mercaptopurine, mafosfamide, etoposide, topotecan, nimustine [ACNU] and bleomycin) are presented. Better understanding of the CSF pharmacology of these drugs is an essential prerequisite for safe, effective administration of these drugs. Investigational efforts are underway to verify the feasibility and efficacy of different dosages, schedules and combination therapies of these new intra-CSF agents. Current and future clinical research should also focus on methods allowing the delivery of tumoricidal drug concentrations for extended periods into the CSF and the brain tissue while minimising neurotoxicity and systemic toxicity (e.g. liposomal drug preparations, monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins and gene therapy).",,"['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University of Bonn, Adenauerallee 119, Bonn, D-53113, Germany. fleischhack@ukb.uni-bonn.de']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: For 63 participants in the pilot study, between-person variability was assessed by comparing reported job tasks among the respondents administered the same job-specific module. Within-respondent variability was assessed by examining changes in the timing and frequency of the job tasks and product use across critical time segments from 12 months before the child's birth to 3 years of age. Parental occupational histories were reviewed to estimate the expected number of job-specific modules required per family. RESULTS: Considerable variability was identified for the tasks performed by the respondents with similar jobs and in the timing of tasks and products used across critical time windows. Parents' occupational histories indicated that detailed exposure information could be obtained for 95% of the families with a maximum of two job-specific modules added to the study interview. CONCLUSIONS: The job-specific modules captured individualized exposure information for the parents of cases and controls and thus reduced the potential for nondifferential misclassification when compared with the use of a job title approach, while avoiding an exposure checklist approach.

A fresh or a recanalized thrombus was observed in each eye. This study considers the temporal aspects of the cases, and it notes the different morphologic features of the occlusion. These observations explain most of the variability of the changes observed in previous reports. We believe these different features representthe various stages in the natural evolution of such a thrombus. The interval between CRVO and histopathologic study in our series ranged from six hours to more than ten years. Local and systemic factors were reviewed and were found to be important in the pathogenesis of thrombus formation. Local diseases with a predisposing effect on CRVO included: glaucoma, papilledema, subdural hemorrhage, optic nerve hemorrhage, and drusen of the optic nerve head. Associated systemic diseases included: hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and leukemia with thrombocytopenia. A fresh thrombus in the CRVO was observed in three (10.3%), and a recanalized thrombus in 26 eyes (89.7%). Endothelial-cell proliferation was a conspicuous feature in 14 (48.3%) of the eyes.

Other patients with solid tumours, due to treatment with cytostatics, hormones and immunomodulators, survive longer and have a better quality of life. Further improvement of results of medical treatment of solid tumours may be foreseen from new classical cytostatics, hormones and immunomodulators and better use of known cytostatics. Liposomal forms of cytostatics are at least equally effective and less toxic than original classical cytostatics. Pegylated forms of cytostatics are more suitable for patients and and will be probably more effective than non-pegylated foms. Rational approaches to treatmet inhibiting angiogenesis and transduction of signals in tumour cells reduce the proliferation of tumour cells and achieve remission of the neoplastic disease. Inhibition of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and tyrosine kinases of growth factor receptors reduces also the proliferation activity of tumour cells and some clinical studies provide evidence of their effectiveness in the treatment of human tumours. Inhibitors of cycline dependent kinases stop the movement of tumour cells across some stages of the cellular cycle and thus inhibit their proliferation. Inhibitors of pharanesyl transferase prevent the activation of ras oncogenes, the formation of pharnesyl isoprenoid and its incorporation into Rh0 proteins, interfere with actin regulation, adhesion and proliferation of cells. These new drugs are less toxic than cytostatics and have a cytostatic as well as cytocidal effect. Their effectiveness is manifested by stabilization or slight regression of the tumour. To achieve an effect long-term treatment with an optimal dose is necessary which is not necessarily identical with the maximum tolerated dose and after discontinuation of treatment a relapse occurs. Combination of new inhibitors of cell division with classical cytostatics enhances the effectiveness of treatment. In the immunotherapy of tumours monoclonal antibodies are most important which have their own antitumourous activity and increase the effectiveness of cytostatics. Vaccines, similarly as gene therapy and modulators of resistance to cytostatics have so far limited indications. Rationally prepared molecules of new substances acting on new objectives of proliferation of tumour cells have a great chance to improve the results of treatment of tumours.",,"['Interna klinika, Narodny onkologicky ustav, Bratislava.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],10,,,Perspektivy internistickej terapie solidnych nadorov.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a clinically useful prognostic index can facilitate therapeutic decision making and evaluation of investigational treatment strategies at relapse of AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prognostic score is presented based on the multivariate analysis of 667 AML patients in first relapse among 1,540 newly diagnosed non-M3 AML patients (age 15 to 60 years) entered onto three successive Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group and the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research Collaborative Group trials. RESULTS: Four clinically relevant parameters are included in this index (ie, length of relapse-free interval after first complete remission, cytogenetics at diagnosis, age at relapse, and whether previous stem-cell transplantation was performed). Using this stratification system, three risk groups were defined: a favorable prognostic group A (overall survival [OS] of 70% at 1 year and 46% at 5 years), an intermediate-risk group B (OS of 49% at 1 year and 18% at 5 years), and a poor-risk group C (OS of 16% at 1 year and 4% at 5 years). CONCLUSION: The prognostic index estimates the outcome of AML patients in first relapse using four commonly applied clinical parameters and might identify patients who are candidates for salvage and investigational therapy.",,"['Erasmus University Medical Center, Department of Hematology, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,20050104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We produced Ara-C-resistant cells from the CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cell line and compared their gene-expression profile with that of wild-type cells. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene was highly up-regulated in Ara-C-resistant cells, while equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and several cell-cycle-related genes were down-regulated. Of all these genes, ENT1 seemed the most likely to be relevant to Ara-C resistance. To investigate the role of ENT1 in Ara-C-resistant cells, we transfected the cells with the gene. ENT1-transfected Ara-C-resistant cells resembled wild-type CCRF-CEM cells more closely than untransfected Ara-C-resistant cells in terms of growth rate, Ara-C-uptake characteristics, and ADA expression levels. The down-regulation of the ENT1 gene is expected to result in nucleotide deficiency in addition to blockage of Ara-C influx. Accordingly, Ara-C-resistant cells showed low growth rates, which were restored by transfection with ENT1. These low growth rates were also correlated with the phosphorylation level of cell-cycle checkpoint kinase 2. In this study we identified down-regulation of ENT1 as the factor responsible for Ara-C resistance, and this knowledge may be used to devise a clinical regimen that will overcome the resistance.",,"['Discovery Research Laboratories, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd, 3-14-1 Sakura, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0003, Japan. k.takagaki@nippon-shinyaku.co.jp']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because long-term exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy may increase the risk of acute transformation, new therapeutic options are needed. Tipifarnib is a nonpeptidomimetic inhibitor of farnesyl transferase that was developed as a potential inhibitor of RAS signaling. In the present study we report that tipifarnib used at pharmacologically achievable concentrations strongly inhibits the erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) autonomous growth that characterizes patients with PV. Moreover, at low tipifarnib concentrations (0.15 muM), the inhibitory effect was preferentially observed in PV BFU-E progenitors and not in normal BFU-E progenitors and was not rescued by erythropoietin (EPO). Thus tipifarnib may specifically target PV stem cells and may be of clinical interest in the treatment of patients with PV.",,"['Service Clinique des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris cedex 10, France.']","['0 (Quinolones)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",,20050104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that this is due to a lack of NK-cell inhibitory receptor mismatching with autologous tumor cells, which may be overcome by allogeneic NK-cell infusions. Here, we test haploidentical, related-donor NK-cell infusions in a nontransplantation setting to determine safety and in vivo NK-cell expansion. Two lower intensity outpatient immune suppressive regimens were tested: (1) low-dose cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone and (2) fludarabine. A higher intensity inpatient regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Hi-Cy/Flu) was tested in patients with poor-prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML). All patients received subcutaneous interleukin 2 (IL-2) after infusions. Patients who received lower intensity regimens showed transient persistence but no in vivo expansion of donor cells. In contrast, infusions after the more intense Hi-Cy/Flu resulted in a marked rise in endogenous IL-15, expansion of donor NK cells, and induction of complete hematologic remission in 5 of 19 poor-prognosis patients with AML. These findings suggest that haploidentical NK cells can persist and expand in vivo and may have a role in the treatment of selected malignancies used alone or as an adjunct to HCT.",,"['Division Medical and Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mille011@umn.edu']",,,20050104,"['M01-RR00400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-55417/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that YopH acutely inhibits T cell antigen receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the Lck tyrosine kinase. Here, we show that prolonged presence of YopH in primary T cells or Jurkat T leukemia cells causes apoptosis, detected by annexin V binding, mitochondrial breakdown, caspase activation, and internucleosomal fragmentation. YopH also causes cell death when expressed in HeLa cells, and this cell death was inhibited by YopH-specific small molecule inhibitors. Cell death induced by YopH was also prevented by caspase inhibition or co-expression of Bcl-xL.

The increase of 14-3-3zeta protein was observed at 48 and 72 h. In this study, the expressions of the 14-3-3zeta gene and the protein were up-regulated at 72 h. In addition, the increase of TPH mRNA was observed at 12, 24 and 72 h in the fluoxetine-treated RBL-2H3 cells. We conclude that fluoxetine induces increases of 14-3-3zeta mRNA, 14-3-3zeta protein and TPH mRNA at 72 h in the RBL-2H3 cells. This suggests that the 14-3-3zeta and TPH genes may play a role in the molecular mechanism of fluoxetine. To date, no cases of 14-3-3zeta alterations by antidepressants and specifically by fluoxetine have been reported.",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Hanyang University, Ansan 426-791, Republic of Korea.']","['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation)', '01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', 'EC 1.14.16.4 (Tryptophan Hydroxylase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: By using flow cytometry (FCM) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CD40 antigen and anti-apoptosis gene survivin mRNA were studied in 48 AML cases and their association with the clinical features of AML was analysed. RESULTS: (1) In the 48 AML cases, positive expression of CD40 antigen was found in 25 cases (52.1%) and positive expression of anti-apoptosis gene survivin mRNA in 35 cases (72.9%). (2) The incidence of splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and hyperleukocytosis in CD40+ AML cases was significantly higher than those in CD40- AML ones (36.0% vs 8.7%), P=0.025; (72.0% vs 43.5%), P=0.045; (32.0% vs 4.4%), P=0.024. (3) There was no difference in the number of the expression of survivin mRNA between CD40+ AML cases and CD40- AML ones (20/25 vs 15/23) P=0.25, but the expression of survivin mRNA of both the groups was high than those of normal controls (20/25 vs 6/20), P=0.001; (15/23 vs 6/20), P=0.021. In the 48 AML cases the rate of the expression of CD40 antigen was less than those of anti-apoptosis gene survivin mRNA (52.1% vs 72.9%), P=0.041.

Unfortunately, fewer than 30% of patients have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling. Advances in our understanding of the HLA system and the development of large international donor registries encourage the increasing use of unrelated donors as an alternative source of stem cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of unrelated donor allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (URD-BMT) for the treatment of childhood leukemia. METHODS: Six patients with leukemia received URD-BMT. Two of them suffered from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 3 suffered from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 1 suffered from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (CR2). All cases were facilitated by Tzu Chi Marrow Donor Registry (TCTMDR). The high resolution DNA test for classIand II was carried out in HLA typing of all donor-receiver pairs. HLA allele matched in three cases, mismatched with one locus in two cases and with two loci in one case. All patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide (CY) 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days (total dose 120 mg/kg) and busulfan (Bu) 1 mg/kg x 4/day for 4 days (total dose 16 mg/kg). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), CsA and MTX were given to prevent acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). CsA of 3 mg/kg/d was continuously given by i.v. infusion, and then 6mg/kg/d by oral. The blood CsA concentration was 200 - 300 ng/ml. MTX was given at the dosage of 15 mg/m(2) on d 1 and 10 mg/m(2) on d 3, 6,9 or 11. MMF was given at the dosage of 0.25 - 0.5 g/d from day 0 to day 120. Prostaglandin E1 was given to prevent the hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), Ganciclovir was used to prevent CMV infection until the CMV antigenemia became negative. RESULTS: Analysis of DNA short tandem repeats showed total engraftment of donor marrow after transplantation in all cases. The median time when granulocyte exceeded 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 14.5 (13 - 18) days, platelets exceeded 20 x 10(9)/L was 16 (14 - 23) days. The acute GVHD grade II-IV occurred in 2 of 6 (33.3%) patients. There were 3 cases with chronic GVHD and none of them developed with the extensive chronic GVHD. All patients were alive in disease-free situation now with median follow-up 412 (187 - 1338) days.

Its mRNA expression levels among hematogical malignancies are characteristic in each type, subtype and distinctive in different phases of disease, making it a reliable diagnostic marker for clinical stages. Recently, researches indicate that high levels of survivin expression are associated with a poor prognosis and may be involved in tumor resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, experiments demonstrate that leukemic vaccination with DC pulsed with survivin antigen in vitro inhibit the proliferation of leukemic cells. Furthermore, when transferred survivin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide or dominant-negative mutant survivin into, malignant cells can be induced apoptosis mediated by downregulation in survivin expression. These findings suggest that survivin may serve as a potential target for biological strategies against hematological neoplasms.

CD34(+) hematopoietic cells from bone marrow (BM) recently have been employed for treating neoplastic and genetic disorders. This study was aimed to investigate membrane surface ultrastructures of bone marrow CD34(+) cell from mormal persons and leukemia patients and to compare their morphologic differences by using atomic force microscope (AFM). BM was collected from 5 normal donors and 6 leukaemia patients. All samples were layered on Ficoll-Paque gradients (specific gravity 1.077 g/ml) to separate the mononuclear cells. After that CD34(+) cells were purified by immuno-magnetic bead separation and evaluated with a FACS Calibur, these cells were detected by AFM of tapping mode inair. At lest 20 cells per samples were observed. The results showed that most of CD34(+) hematopoietic cells were like circle plate, the diameter was 10 - 14 microm. The surface of CD34(+) hematopoietic cell membrane was comparatively complex. The surface of CD34(+) hematopoietic cell membrane appeared as granular, with packed particles. With the region analysis function of IP2.1 software, the region of 2 microm x 2 microm was selected and four parameters of the surface (maximum peak-to-valley distance, average roughness, root-mean-squared roughness and mean height) were measured. Values of the 4 parameters showed that the characteristic parameters of CD34(+) HSPC from leukaemia were higher than that from normal person. It is concluded that AFM has specific advantages in analyzing cell membrane in the nanometer level and can gain more information. With the help of analysis software, AFM can be a helpful tool for fast leukaemic diagnosis and CD34(+) hematopoietic cells selection.",,"['Department of Chemistry, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was carried out on the group of 40 children aged 2-15 years (mean +/- 3.46), including 31 lower risk patients (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich protocol--BFM) and 9 high risk patients (New York protocol--NY). Levels of IgA, IgG, IgM and IgE, and subsets of mononuclear cells using flow cytometry were evaluated in the study group every 1-3 months. During maintenance therapy we found markedly reduced leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, and mean values of IgA, IgM and IgG in comparison to healthy children. A gradual increase was observed in the level of IgG, in the percentage and absolute number of B lymphocytes (CD19+) and in helper/suppressor T-cell ratios. In the group of patients treated according to the NY protocol, a decrease was noted in: lymphocytosis, in the percentage of lymphocytes B, in the levels of IgG and IgM, in the percentage and absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, T-helper cells and CD4/CD8 and CD3 RA/RO ratios, compared to standard risk patients. In the course of infection, a transitory increase was observed in activated T-cells, and a rise was found in the number of T-memory cells and monocytes showing the expression of adhesive molecules. CONCLUSIONS: In the course of maintenance treatment in children with ALL, constant suppression of the immune system, of both humoral and cellular responses, can be observed especially in the group of children treated according to the NY protocol; activation of T lymphocytes and monocytes takes place in the course of infection.

Epub 2005 Jan 4.,"BACKGROUND: Stimulated by earlier reports on the presence of retroviruses in mouse and hamster melanoma cell lines, we addressed the question as to whether human melanoma cell lines might also harbour a retrovirus. METHODS AND RESULTS: The melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-25, SK-MEL-28, MEL-JUSO, MML-I, MeWo, A-375, Colo-38, BS-780 were confirmed to be human by human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and supernatants were tested by the product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. Cell lines SK-MEL-25, SK-MEL-28, MEL-JUSO and MML-I were positive, whereas cell lines MeWo, A-375, Colo-38 and BS-780 were negative. The RT activity peaked at a buoyant density in sucrose typical for retroviruses. From this peak fraction an R-U5 sequence indistinguishable from murine leukemia virus (MLV) was identified by particle-associated retrovirus RNA amplification (PARRA). Semiquantitative MLV-specific RNA-PCR demonstrated colocalization of the MLV-like RNA and RT activity on the sucrose gradient of SK-Mel-25. MLV RNA and DNA were also detectable in culture supernatants of SK-MEL-28, MEL-JUSO and MML-I, but not of MeWo, A-375, Colo-38 and BS-780 by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence comparison revealed highest homology with the RET sequence previously identified in mouse myeloma SP2/0-AG14 cells. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that certain human melanoma cell lines are productively infected by a MLV which was probably introduced during tumour passage in mice or by laboratory contamination many years ago and subsequently spread to other lines. CONCLUSION: We recommend mandatory testing of melanoma and other human cell lines for contamination with infectious MLV or other animal retroviruses, similar to mycoplasma screening, in order to avoid artificial experimental data.",,"['Department of Dermatology, Heidelberg University Clinics, Vossstrasse 2, 69115, Heidelberg, Germany. martin_deichmann@med.uni-heidelberg.de']","['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,20050104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) has now been identified as a principal platelet receptor for collagen. In this paper, we report the cases of two patients with a myelodysplasia and a B lymphopathy, respectively, who presented with thrombocytopathy in relation to a defective GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity to collagen. Thus, with regard to the different steps of adhesion, activation secretion or aggregation, patients' platelet responses to collagen and to the GPVI specific agonists, collagen related peptide (CRP) or convulxin were null or dramatically impaired. Platelet responses to other agonists ADP, TRAP, Arachidonic acid were normal or showed only a moderate decrease. GPVI content was repeatedly normal, and binding of specific ligands, such as convulxin, satisfactory. Nevertheless, specific activating monoclonal antibodies and convulxin failed to induce platelet secretion; collagen, CRP or convulxin were unable to provoke calcium mobilisation. Furthermore, using a perfusion chamber model, we showed that ex vivo collagen-induced thrombi formation was very impaired. Taken together, these data provide evidence, for the first time, of an acquired defect in GPVI-mediated platelet reactivity to collagen, which reflects data observed in constitutional GPVI deficiencies, in two patients with malignant haemopathies.",,"['AP-HP, Hopital Lariboisiere, Laboratory of Haematology, 2, rue Ambroise Pare, 75010 Paris, France. sylvia.bellucci@lrb.ap-hop-paris.fr']","['0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (platelet membrane glycoprotein VI)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the direct involvement of atypical PKC-zeta in SDF-1 signaling in immature human CD34(+)-enriched cells and in leukemic pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) G2 cells. Chemotaxis, cell polarization, and adhesion of CD34(+) cells to bone marrow stromal cells were found to be PKC-zeta dependent. Overexpression of PKC-zeta in G2 and U937 cells led to increased directional motility to SDF-1. Interestingly, impaired SDF-1-induced migration of the pre-B ALL cell line B1 correlated with reduced PKC-zeta expression. SDF-1 triggered PKC-zeta phosphorylation, translocation to the plasma membrane, and kinase activity. Furthermore we identified PI3K as an activator of PKC-zeta, and Pyk-2 and ERK1/2 as downstream targets of PKC-zeta. SDF-1-induced proliferation and MMP-9 secretion also required PKC-zeta activation. Finally, we showed that in vivo engraftment, but not homing, of human CD34(+)-enriched cells to the bone marrow of NOD/SCID mice was PKC-zeta dependent and that injection of mice with inhibitory PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate peptides resulted in mobilization of murine progenitors.

We measured in vivo MTXPG accumulation in leukemia cells from 101 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and established that B-lineage ALL with either TEL-AML1 or E2A-PBX1 gene fusion, or T-lineage ALL, accumulates significantly lower MTXPG compared with B-lineage ALL without these genetic abnormalities or compared with hyperdiploid (fewer than 50 chromosomes) ALL. To elucidate mechanisms underlying these differences in MTXPG accumulation, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze expression of 32 folate pathway genes in diagnostic leukemia cells from 197 children. This revealed ALL subtype-specific patterns of folate pathway gene expression that were significantly related to MTXPG accumulation. We found significantly lower expression of the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1, an MTX uptake transporter) in E2A-PBX1 ALL, significantly higher expression of breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2, an MTX efflux transporter) in TEL-AML1 ALL, and lower expression of FPGS (which catalyzes formation of MTXPG) in T-lineage ALL, consistent with lower MTXPG accumulation in these ALL subtypes.

Epub 2005 Jan 3.,"Earlier studies have demonstrated an over-expression of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (9-OAcSGs) on lymphoblasts, concomitant with high titers of anti-9-OAcSGs in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present study was aimed to evaluate whether this high induction of anti-9-OAcSGs at disease presentation contributes toward immune surveillance. Accordingly, anti-9-OAcSGs were affinity purified from sera of ALL patients and normal individuals, and their specificity toward the glycotope having terminal 9-O-acetylated sialic acid-linked subterminal N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) in alpha2-6 manner (9-OAcSAalpha2-6GalNAc) was established by hemagglutination assay, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Subclass distribution of anti-9-OAcSGs revealed a predominance of IgG2 in ALL. Analysis of glycosylation of anti-9-OAcSGs purified from sera of ALL patients (IgG(ALL)) and normal individuals (IgG(N)) by digoxigenin glycan enzyme assay, fluorimetric estimation, gas-liquid chromatography and lectin-binding assays demonstrated that disease-specific antibodies differ in content and nature as compared with normal controls. Enhanced amount of 9-OAcSA-specific IgG2 induced in ALL was unable to trigger activation of FcgammaR, the complement cascade and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, although its glycotope-binding ability remains unaffected. Interestingly, only IgG1N emerged as the potent mediator of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement fixation and activator of effector cells through FcgammaR. In ALL, the observed subclass switching of anti-9-OAcSGs to IgG2, alteration in their glycosylation profile along with impairment of a few Fc-glycosylation-sensitive effector functions hints toward a disbalanced homeostasis, thereby evading the host defense. These findings justify further evaluation of the mechanism for functional unresponsiveness of antibodies and production of 9-OAcSA-specific chimeric antibodies with normal Fc domain for therapeutic applications.",,"['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

Rarely, it can also occur as an isolated mass. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathologic features of 6 patients with myeloid sarcoma involving the breast. DESIGN: Clinical information for all 6 patients was obtained from the medical record. Routine hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides; naphthol AS-D chloroacetate stain; and immunohistochemical stains for myeloid, B-cell, and T-cell antigens were prepared. RESULTS: There were 6 women with a median age of 52 years (range, 31-73 years). Two patients presented with isolated tumors of the breast, with no history or subsequent development of acute myeloid leukemia. In 3 patients, the breast tumors represented relapse of acute myeloid leukemia. One patient who presented initially with myeloid sarcoma involving the breast, skin, and spleen was lost to follow-up. Histologically, these tumors were classified as well differentiated (n = 3), poorly differentiated (n = 2), and blastic (n = 1). Naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase was positive in all 3 cases assessed. Immunohistochemistry showed that myeloperoxidase (n = 5) and CD43 (n = 3) were positive, and CD3 (n = 5) and CD20 (n = 5) were negative in all cases assessed. Lysozyme was positive in 4 (80%) of 5; CD117 was positive in 2 (67%) of 3; and single cases were positive for CD45 (1/3), TdT (1/2), CD79a, and the PAX5 gene product. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid sarcoma involving the breast is uncommon. In the literature, as in this study, these tumors most often represent relapse or the initial presentation of acute myeloid leukemia. However, 2 of the cases we report presented with isolated masses, without a history or subsequent development of acute myeloid leukemia at last follow-up. Immunohistochemical studies are extremely helpful for recognizing isolated myeloid sarcoma.",,"['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M. D.

Although the glucose transporters are capable of transporting mannose, it has been postulated that the entry of mannose in mammalian cells is mediated by a transporter that is insensitive to glucose [Panneerselvam, K., and Freeze, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9417-9421] or by a transporter induced by cell treatment with metformin [Shang, J., and Lehrman, M. A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9703-9712]. We performed a detailed analysis of the uptake of mannose in normal human erythrocytes and in leukemia cell line HL-60. Short uptake assays allowed the identification of a single functional activity involved in mannose uptake in both cell types, with a K(m) for transport of 6 mM. Transport was inhibited in a competitive manner by classical glucose transporter substrates. Similarly, the glucose transporter inhibitors cytochalasin B, genistein, and myricetin inhibited mannose transport by 100%. Using long uptake experiments, we identified a second, high-affinity component associated with the intracellular trapping of mannose in the HL-60 cells that is not directly involved in the transport of mannose via the glucose transporters. Thus, the transport of mannose via glucose transporters is a process which is kinetically and biologically separable from its intracellular trapping. A general survey of human cells revealed that mannose uptake was entirely blocked by concentrations of cytochalasin B that obliterates the activity of the glucose transporters. The transport and inhibition data demonstrate that extracellular mannose, whose physiological concentration is in the micromolar range, enters cells in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose. Overall, our data indicate that transport through the glucose transporter is the main mechanism by which human cells acquire mannose.",,"['Centro de Investigaciones Mineras y Metalurgicas, Casilla 170/C10, Vitacura, Santiago, Chile.']","['IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,,['EY08918/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have visualized, by electron microscopy, RNA dimers formed from the leader region of the prototype lentivirus, maedi visna virus. Characterization by in vitro assays of the domains responsible for this interaction has identified a 20 nucleotide sequence that functions as the core dimerization initiation site. This region is predicted to form a GACG tetraloop and therefore differs significantly from the kissing loop palindromes utilized to initiate dimerization in primate lentiviruses. The motif is strongly conserved across the ovine and caprine lentiviruses, implying a critical functional role. Furthermore, the proposed GACG tetraloop exhibits marked structural homology with similar structural motifs present in the leader regions of the alpha- and gamma-retroviruses, and the maedi visna virus dimer linkage region is capable of forming heterodimeric species with the Moloney murine leukemia virus Psi domain.

Mathematical analysis that completely determines the global dynamics of this model has been done by Wang et al. (Math. Biosci., 2002). In this note, we first modify the parameters of the model to distinguish between contact and infectivity rates. Then we introduce a discrete time delay to the model to describe the time between emission of contagious particles by active CD4+ T-cells and infection of pure cells. Using the results in Culshaw and Ruan (Math.

Indeed, we found that treatment of Jurkat cells with 3,4,5-THS, unlike treatment with resveratrol, induced activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis by a Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein-dependent mechanism without involving the known death ligands CD95 ligand (CD95L), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Therefore, 3,4,5-THS induced activation of a FADD-dependent apoptotic mechanism that was unresponsive to the parental compound resveratrol.

METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-three patients who were entered into two consecutive prospective Phase-II studies of the German Testicular Cancer Study Group were analyzed. A total of 221 patients had received HD-VIP containing cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide and 102 patients were treated with Tax-HD-VIP containing cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, and paclitaxel, each cycle supported by autologous PBSCT. RESULTS: Patients had received a median cumulative etoposide dose of 4.9 g/m(2) (range, 2.2-9.4 g/m(2)). The median follow-up duration for all patients was 36 months (range, 0-128) with a median follow up time of 50 months (range, 0-128) for patients surviving at least 1 year after therapy. One patient developed a secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) involving a chromosomal translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) 24 months after the start of chemotherapy resulting in a cumulative incidence of 0.48% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-1.42]. Additionally, two patients with primary mediastinal germ cell cancer developed a myelodysplastic syndrome. No solid tumors had occurred.

AML-DCs express constitutionally leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs) present in AML blasts they are generated from. Here we investigated whether the generation of AML-DCs would alter the expression level of LAAs. Moreover, we evaluated the presence of HLA and costimulatory molecules on AML blasts versus AML-DCs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the following LAAs: preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME), the receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility (RHAMM/CD168), Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT-1) and proteinase 3. The expression of HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86 was evaluated by flow cytometry. RHAMM protein expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry, recognition of AML-DCs by PRAME epitope-specific T cells was evaluated in a chromium-release assay. Quantitative real-time PCR for AML-DCs versus AML blasts showed an alteration in mRNA expression of LAAs. An elevated PCR signal for PRAME was detected in 7/12 AML-DC preparations. 6/12 AML-DC preparations showed a significant upregulation of the PCR signal for RHAMM. A stronger WT-1 and proteinase-3 signal was observed in PCR for only 2/12 and 1/12 AML-DCs , respectively. All preparations showed a strong expression of at least one of the LAAs examined. As demonstrated by flow cytometry, AML-DCs strongly upregulated costimulatory molecules like CD40 and CD80 in comparison with AML blasts. AML-DCs tested positive for RHAMM protein. PRAME positive AML-DCs were recognized by specific T cells. AML-DCs might constitute a powerful tool in immunotherapy for AML. Real-time PCR allows a quick and quantitative assessment of immunologically relevant LAA expression with only 10(5) DCs and might be helpful for the decision whether the AML-DC vaccination strategy is favourable or not.",,"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Street 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",,20041231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with hematologic malignancies, increased production of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein is associated with chemotherapy resistance, aggressive clinical course, and poor survival. Bcl-2 is an important molecular target. Downregulating Bcl-2 can potentially reverse inherent tumor resistance to, and possibly improve response to therapy. This review focuses on the preclinical data, as well as the current clinical information available on oblimersen, a novel antisense approach targeting Bcl-2 in malignant hematologic disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Early clinical trials have shown single-agent activity of oblimersen in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and thus, provide proof of principle for antisense therapy. Phase I and phase II studies using oblimersen in combination with conventional chemotherapy have shown encouraging results in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. Phase III studies in patients with multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia have completed accrual and results are awaited. SUMMARY: Bcl-2 is a clinically meaningful target in patients with hematologic malignancies. Downregulation of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein can be achieved with oblimersen (antisense molecule specific for Bcl-2). Early clinical results suggest a possible role of this antisense approach in targeting Bcl-2. Ongoing clinical trials will establish the clinical utility of oblimersen in patients with hematologic malignancies.",,"['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. asher.chanan-khan@roswellpark.org']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motexafin gadolinium is a member of a class of rationally designed porphyrin-like molecules called texaphyrins. The rationale for its use in cancer therapy is that, like naturally occurring porphyrins, it tends to concentrate selectively in cancer cells and it has a novel mechanism of action as it induces redox stress, triggering apoptosis in a broad range of cancers. RECENT FINDINGS: In vitro studies have shown that motexafin gadolinium is synergistic with radiation and varied chemotherapeutic agents. A phase III international study has shown that the onset of neurologic progression is significantly delayed in patients with brain metastases from lung cancer treated with whole-brain radiation and motexafin gadolinium (compared with radiation alone). Recent preclinical data have shown that motexafin gadolinium alone is cytotoxic to cancers such as multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia through redox and apoptotic pathways. Multiple clinical trials examining motexafin gadolinium as a single agent and in combination with radiation and/or chemotherapy for the treatment of solid and hematopoietic tumors are underway. SUMMARY: Motexafin gadolinium is a novel tumor-targeted agent that disrupts redox balance in cancer cells by futile redox cycling. Motexafin gadolinium is currently in numerous hematology/oncology clinical trials for use as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 N.

There is an extensive body of evidence suggesting that the efficacy of glucocorticoids stems from their ability to mediate apoptosis in leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Traditionally, glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is divided into three stages: an initiation stage, which involves glucocorticoid receptor activation and glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene regulation; a decision stage, which engages the prosurvival and proapoptotic factors at the mitochondrial level; and an execution stage, which implicates caspases and endonuclease activation. Recent discoveries have clarified many aspects of the apoptotic pathway, including activation of the caspases cascade and multicatalytic proteasome, suppression of prosurvival transcription factors such as AP-1, c-myc, nuclear factor-kappaB, as well as cross-talk between the T-cell receptor and cytokine signaling pathways.

Epub 2004 Dec 30.,"Approximately 50 different chromosomal translocations of the human MLL gene are currently known and associated with high-risk acute leukemia. The large number of different MLL translocation partner genes makes a precise diagnosis a demanding task. After their cytogenetic identification, only the most common MLL translocations are investigated by RT-PCR analyses, whereas infrequent or unknown MLL translocations are excluded from further analyses. Therefore, we aimed at establishing a method that enables the detection of any MLL rearrangement by using genomic DNA isolated from patient biopsy material. This goal was achieved by establishing a universal long-distance inverse-PCR approach that allows the identification of any kind of MLL rearrangement if located within the breakpoint cluster region. This method was applied to biopsy material derived from 40 leukemia patients known to carry MLL abnormalities. Thirty-six patients carried known MLL fusions (34 with der(11) and 2 with reciprocal alleles), whereas 3 patients were found to carry novel MLL fusions to ACACA, SELB, and SMAP1, respectively. One patient carried a genomic fusion between MLL and TIRAP, resulting from an interstitial deletion. Because of this interstitial deletion, portions of the MLL and TIRAP genes were deleted, together with 123 genes located within the 13-Mbp interval between both chromosomal loci. Therefore, this previously undescribed diagnostic tool has been proven successful for analyzing any MLL rearrangement including previously unrecognized partner genes. Furthermore, the determined patient-specific fusion sequences are useful for minimal residual disease monitoring of MLL associated acute leukemias.",,"['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/Center for Drug Research, Development and Safety (ZAFES), Biocenter, University of Frankfurt, D-60439 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (SMAP1 protein, human)', '0 (TIRAP protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,20041230,,,,,,PMC544299,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 30.,"Antiapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a hematopoietic neoplasm associated with the BCR/ABL oncogene. We have examined expression of MCL-1 in primary CML cells and BCR/ABL-transformed cell lines. Independent of the phase of disease, isolated primary CML cells expressed myeloid cell leukemia-1 (mcl-1) mRNA and the MCL-1 protein in a constitutive manner. The BCR/ABL inhibitor imatinib (=STI571) decreased the expression of MCL-1 in these cells. Correspondingly, BCR/ABL enhanced mcl-1 promoter activity, mcl-1 mRNA expression, and the MCL-1 protein in Ba/F3 cells. BCR/ABL-dependent expression of MCL-1 in Ba/F3 cells was counteracted by the mitogen-activated protein-kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, but not by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. Identical results were obtained for constitutive expression of MCL-1 in primary CML cells and the CML-derived cell lines K562 and KU812. To investigate the role of MCL-1 as a survival-related target in CML cells, mcl-1 siRNA and mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were applied. The resulting down-regulation of MCL-1 was found to be associated with a substantial decrease in viability of K562 cells. Moreover, the mcl-1 ASO was found to synergize with imatinib in producing growth inhibition in these cells. Together, our data identify MCL-1 as a BCR/ABL-dependent survival factor and interesting target in CML.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, AKH-Wien, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1097 Vienna, Austria.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,20041230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PegLD). Bortezomib was given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 from 0.90 to 1.50 mg/m2 and PegLD on day 4 at 30 mg/m2 to 42 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in at least 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, pneumonia, peripheral neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea. The MTD based on cycle 1 was 1.50 and 30 mg/m2 of bortezomib and PegLD, respectively. However, due to frequent dose reductions and delays at this level, 1.30 and 30 mg/m2 are recommended for further study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies did not find significant drug interactions between these agents. Antitumor activity was seen against multiple myeloma, with 8 of 22 evaluable patients having a complete response (CR) or near-CR, including several with anthracycline-refractory disease, and another 8 having partial responses (PRs).

Epub 2004 Dec 30.,"HIV-1 Nef protein is a major determinant of the pathogenicity of the virus. It has been shown that Nef activates Hck, a member of Src family kinase, in monocytes/macrophages and that the interaction is critical for AIDS-like disease progression in a mouse model. However, it was unclear how the molecular interaction in monocytes/macrophages leads to disease progression. Here, we show for the first time that Nef interferes with the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)/M-CSF receptor signal pathway. In this study, we introduced a conditionally active Nef into myeloid leukemia TF-1-fms cells and analyzed their responsiveness to M-CSF. We found that Nef-activated Hck constitutively associated with the M-CSF receptor complex. The formation of the molecular complex should occur under physiologic conditions, that is, on M-CSF stimulation. Because of aberrant molecular association, the tyrosine-phosphorylation/activation of the receptor in response to M-CSF was markedly diminished in Nef-active cells. Consequently, Nef activation caused the inhibition of M-CSF-mediated proliferation of TF-1-fms cells and macrophage differentiation of the cells induced by M-CSF and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. These results indicate that HIV-1 Nef interferes with M-CSF receptor signaling through Hck activation and thereby inhibits M-CSF functions in monocytes/macrophages.",,"['Division of Hematopoiesis, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']","['0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",,20041230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although FLT3-LM (length mutation) and TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutations have been considered to be mutually exclusive, 1% to 2% of patients carry both mutations. However, the functional and clinical significance of this observation is unclear. We demonstrate that FLT3-ITD-TKD dual mutants induce drug resistance toward PTK inhibitors and cytotoxic agents in in vitro model systems. As molecular mechanisms of resistance, we found that FLT3-ITD-TKD mutants cause hyperactivation of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-5), leading to upregulation of Bcl-x(L) and RAD51 and arrest in the G(2)M phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of Bcl-x(L) was identified as the critical mediator of drug resistance and recapitulates the PTK inhibitor and daunorubicin-resistant phenotype in FLT3-ITD cells. The combination of rapamycin, a selective mTOR inhibitor, and FLT3 PTK inhibitors restored the drug sensitivity in FLT3 dual mutant-expressing cells.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which PML modulates apoptosis following genotoxic stress are only partially elucidated. PML is essential for p53-dependent induction of programmed cell death upon gamma-irradiation through PML-nuclear body (NB)-mediated control of p53 acetylation. Here, we show that PML selectively regulates proapoptotic transcription factors upon different types of DNA damage. We find that Pml inactivation protects fibroblasts from UV-induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. We demonstrate that c-Jun is required for UV-induced apoptosis and that PML is essential for both c-Jun transcriptional activation and DNA binding upon UV radiation.

Under these rules, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is considered to be a nonradiogenic form of cancer. In other words, workers who develop CLL automatically have their compensation claim rejected because the compensation rules hold that the risk of radiation-induced CLL is zero. In this article we review molecular, clinical, and epidemiologic evidence regarding the radiogenicity of CLL. We note that current understanding of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and the etiology of lymphatic neoplasia provides a strong mechanistic basis for expecting that ionizing radiation exposure increases CLL risk. The clinical characteristics of CLL, including prolonged latency and morbidity periods and a low case fatality rate, make it relatively difficult to evaluate associations between ionizing radiation and CLL risk via epidemiologic methods. The epidemiologic evidence of association between external exposure to ionizing radiation and CLL is weak. However, epidemiologic findings are consistent with a hypothesis of elevated CLL mortality risk after a latency and morbidity period that spans several decades. Our findings in this review suggest that there is not a persuasive basis for the conclusion that CLL is a nonradiogenic form of cancer.",,"['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-8050, USA. david_richardson@unc.edu']",,48,,,,,,,PMC1253701,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although B-CLL pathogenesis is not entirely understood, the progressive increase in lymphocyte counts coupled with the very low proportion of proliferating cells suggests that B-CLL may be primarily determined by defective apoptosis. Consistently, freshly analyzed CLL B-cells express very low levels of membrane CD95, one of the best-known receptors involved in triggering apoptosis. In this study, CD95 upregulation on CLL B-cells was induced by culturing clonal B-cells in the presence of supernatants from preactivated autologous T-lymphocytes. Intracellular cytokine staining of preactivated autologous T-lymphocytes using monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) specific for Th1 or Th2 cytokines, namely interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma, showed these cells to be positive for IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Blocking experiments using moAbs specific for IL-2 and/or IFN-gamma revealed that CD95 upregulation on CLL B-cells was mainly driven by IFN-gamma.

The progenitor cell activity (PCA) of ABM and ACB was also assayed. RESULTS: After coculturing for 24 hrs with IL-2, the tumor-killing activities of ABM to K562 cells and to HL-60 cells were identical, while the activity of ACB to K562 cells was higher than that to HL-60 cells. After 72 hr coculturing, the activities of ABM to K562 and HL-60 cells were still higher than that of ACB. The optimum conditions for the activation of ABM and ACB were 1000U/ml IL-2, 1 x 10(6)/ml cells, 100 : 1 effector to target ratio and 72 hr culturing.

The presumption that these differences are induced by changes in the FN arrangement was confirmed by the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct FN domains, and by the blocking of alpha5beta1 integrin receptor with the synthetic Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP) peptide. The RGD sequence located within the FN cell-binding domain seems to be masked in the structure adopted on nonsulfonated surfaces, which hinders the integrin-ligand interaction.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Department of Biophysics and Biomathematics, Medical Centre for Postgraduate Education, ul.

We followed-up a population-based cohort of 1160 patients with UC diagnosed in Copenhagen County between 1962 and 1987 for up to 36 years to analyze the overall and site-specific cancer risk. METHODS: Observed vs. expected cancers were presented as standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) with 95% exact confidence intervals (CI) calculated by using individual person-years at risk and sex- and age-specific incidence rates for the Danish background population in 1995. RESULTS: The cohort was followed-up for a median of 19 years, or 22,290 person-years. A total of 124 malignancies were observed compared with 139.85 expected (SMR, .89; 95% CI, .74-1.07). The observed number of CRCs was almost exactly equal to expected: 13 cases vs. 12.42 (SMR, 1.05; 95% CI, .56-1.79). The cumulative probability of CRC was .4% by 10 years, 1.1% by 20 years, and 2.1% by 30 years of disease. Among men, melanoma was increased (SMR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.38-7.10); otherwise, no increased risk for cancer could be detected. No hepatobiliary cancers and no increased risk for lymphoma or leukemia were found. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the overall cancer risk, nor the CRC risk, were increased in this population-based cohort after a median of 19 years of follow-up evaluation. An active surgical approach in medical treatment failures and long-term use of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) as relapse prevention may explain this remarkable result.",,"['Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Department of Medical Gastroenterology C, Herlev 2730, Denmark.

However, treatment-related toxicity and, in patients with advanced MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB]; RAEB in transformation [RAEB-T]) or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia (tAML), posttransplantation relapse continue to be prevalent. Induction chemotherapy (IC) has been used in an attempt to decrease the risk of posttransplantation relapse, but the benefit for posttransplantation long-term survival is uncertain. We reviewed results in 125 patients with advanced MDS and tAML who received transplants from HLA-identical related or unrelated donors after preparation with myeloablative conditioning regimens. Thirty-three patients (3 with RAEB, 6 with RAEB-T, and 24 with tAML) received IC before transplantation, and 92 patients (62 with RAEB, 22 with RAEB-T, and 8 with tAML) did not.

Thirty-two patients had indolent (low-grade), 42 had aggressive (intermediate-grade), and 27 had very aggressive (high-grade) non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Thirty-six patients had primary refractory disease, 20 had a chemoresistant relapse, 35 patients had a chemosensitive relapse, and 10 patients were ""initial high risk"" patients. The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range, 1-5). The preparative regimen (BEP) was bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) 600 mg/m 2 , etoposide 2400 mg/m 2 , and Platinol (cisplatin) 200 mg/m 2 given intravenously over 5 days. Within 3 weeks before transplantation, 70 patients received involved-field radiotherapy (IFR) 20 Gy to sites of currently active (>2 cm) or prior bulky (>5 cm) disease. Most patients (n = 93) received mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (median CD34 + cell dose, 6.7 x 10 6 /kg).

On multivariate analysis, age (<60 or > or =60 years), histologic grade (low versus intermediate or high), the use of IFR, and chemotherapy response at baseline did not affect OS or DFS. Of 70 patients given IFR, 27 relapsed: 10 (37%) within and 17 (63%) outside the radiation field. The use of IFR did not affect either OS or DFS, probably because IFR was offered to patients with bulky or chemoresistant disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 561 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel alone or in combination with carboplatin. RESULTS: The response rate was 17% in the paclitaxel arm and 30% in the carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (P < .0001). Median failure-free survival was 2.5 months in the paclitaxel arm and 4.6 months in the carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (P = .0002). Median survival times were 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8 to 7.8) and 8.8 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 9.9), and 1-year survival rates were 32% (95% CI, 27% to 38%), and 37% (95% CI, 32% to 43%), respectively. The overall survival distributions were not statistically different: hazard ratio = 0.91 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.17; P = .25). Hematological toxicity and nausea were more frequent in the combination arm, but febrile neutropenia and toxic deaths were equally low in both arms. There was no significant survival difference in elderly patients. Performance status 2 patients treated with combination chemotherapy had a better survival rate than those treated with single-agent therapy (P = .019). CONCLUSION: Combination chemotherapy improves response rate and failure-free survival compared with single-agent therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference in the primary end point of overall survival.

Epub 2004 Dec 29.,"Interactions between the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suberanoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and sodium butyrate (SB) and the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 antagonist 17-allylamino 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) have been examined in Bcr-Abl(+) human leukemia cells (K562 and LAMA84), including those sensitive and resistant to STI571 (imatinib mesylate). Cotreatment with 17-AAG and SAHA or SB synergistically induced mitochondrial dysfunction (cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor release), caspase-3 and -8 activation, apoptosis, and growth inhibition. Similar effects were observed in LAMA84 cells and K562 cells resistant to STI571, as well as in CD34(+) cells isolated from the bone marrows of three patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. These events were associated with increased binding of Bcr-Abl, Raf-1, and Akt to Hsp70, and inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Akt. In addition, 17-AAG/SAHA abrogated the DNA binding and the transcriptional activities of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 in K562 cells, including those ectopically expressing a constitutively active STAT5A construct. Cotreatment with 17-AAG and SAHA also induced down-regulation of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and B-Raf; up-regulation of Bak; cleavage of 14-3-3 proteins; and a profound conformational change in Bax accompanied by translocation to the membrane fraction. Moreover, ectopic expression of Bcl-2 attenuated cell death induced by this regimen, implicating mitochondrial injury in the lethality observed. Together, these findings raise the possibility that combining HDAC inhibitors with the Hsp90 antagonist 17-AAG may represent a novel strategy against Bcr-Abl(+) leukemias, including those resistant to STI571.",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, MCV Station Box 230, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",,20041229,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was low efficiency compared with wild-type ES cells; other hematopoietic lineage cells of granulocytes, B cells, mast cells, megakaryocytes, and erythroid cells were not generated. Osteoclasts developed in this culture were multinucleated and competent for bone resorption.

In U251 glioma cells, however, TPA efficiently increased the Bcl-xL level. These regulations were also seen for a transfected splicing reporter mini-gene. Further analyses of deletion mutants indicate that nucleotides 1-176 on the downstream intron are required for the IL-6 effect, whereas additional nucleotides 177-284 are essential for the GM-CSF effects.

Mortality in the cohort from a number of causes has been analyzed with respect to individual radiation doses. The cohort displays a very substantial healthy worker effect, i.e. considerably lower cancer and noncancer mortality than the general population. Based on 26 and 368 deaths, respectively, positive though statistically nonsignificant associations were seen for mortality from leukemia (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and all solid cancers combined, with excess relative risks per sievert of 5.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.56, 30.4] and 0.506 (95% CI -2.01, 4.64), respectively.

Of the other nine patients, 4 had nonmalignant neurologic disease and five had a lymphoproliferative disorder: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 4) and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1). In patients who had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, the monoclonal B-cell population was small and had an immunophenotype identical to that of circulating malignant B cells.

Results of flow cytometry were correlated with the morphologic diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the cases reviewed, 125 (36%) showed a visible decrease in CD19 expression compared with normal B lymphocytes. Decreased CD19 expression was noted in 79% of follicular lymphomas (27 of 34), 36% of small lymphocytic lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukemias (82 of 228), 31% of mantle cell lymphomas (4 of 13), 24% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (8 of 33), and 13% of marginal zone B-cell lymphomas/lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas (4 of 30) and was not observed in any Burkitt lymphoma (0 of 5) or hairy cell leukemia (0 of 6).

In vivo, these cells have an antiapoptotic phenotype (high levels of Bcl-2 and low levels of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bax). Abnormal B cells accumulate due to altered apoptosis regulation rather than to increased proliferation. However, it is unclear whether there are inherent Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway defects. With in vitro culture, these B cells rapidly apoptosis. METHODS: To investigate apoptosis regulation, Bcl-2, Bax, mitochondrial membrane potential, annexin V, and caspase activation were simultaneous monitored in individual cells during in vitro apoptosis. RESULTS: With in vitro culture, 30% to 50% of B cells were apoptotic at 24 h compared with fewer than 10% of T cells. Apoptotic B cells showed dramatic Bax upregulation and slight Bcl-2 decreases accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased activated caspase-3 protein levels. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were increased 18- to 51-fold and 6- to 11-fold, respectively, after 24 h of culture. Caspase-8 showed limited or no activation (less than fourfold). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that in vitro apoptosis of CLL B cells occurs through a well-characterized Bcl-2 regulatory pathway consistent with that pathway being functional. Further, these cells' antiapoptotic phenotype is dependent on the in vivo environment, potentially involving paracrine/autocrine interactions.","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Robert H.

The present study was performed to determine (a) the degree of changes in immunophenotype and their consequences on the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in childhood AML and (b) whether certain clusters of changes in antigen expression patterns exist between diagnosis and relapse. METHODS: Bone marrow specimens of 48 children enrolled in the German AML-BFM-93/98 (Acute Myeloid Leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) studies were analyzed immunologically, morphologically, and genetically at diagnosis and at first relapse. RESULTS: The immunophenotypes by flow cytometry differed by at least one antigen between samples at presentation and relapse in 42 of 48 children (88%). More children displayed an immature phenotype at relapse (43 of 47, 91.5%, vs. 37 of 48, 77%; P = 0.05) with expression of CD34 and/or CD117. This was reflected by a gain of markers that are associated with lineage immaturity in 18 of 25 (72%) of cases, whereas the loss of such antigens was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients. We did not observe significant changes for lineage specific markers, with comparable occurrences of loss or gain of myeloid and lymphoid antigens in the sample pairs. Only minimal changes were seen for morphologic and genetic features. CONCLUSION: An antigenic shift was observed in 88% of cases in this study. The antibody panels used for MRD monitoring in childhood AML should therefore not be restricted to the immunophenotype detected at presentation but should include in particular markers of lineage immaturity. The clinical observation of a shift toward a more immature phenotype of the myeloblasts is consistent with the model of a clonal evolution of a leukemic stem cell.","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany. langebra@uni-muenster.de""]","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was approved by the FDA in 1987 for the treatment of adult acute myeloid leukemia and in 1996 for symptomatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In 2000, mitoxantrone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), secondary progressive MS, and progressive-relapsing MS. Mitoxantrone is taken up rapidly by tissues, from which it is released slowly, and the terminal half-life ranges from 8.9 hours to 9 days. The highest concentrations of the drug are typically found in the thyroid, liver, and heart, and the drug persists in the body for as long as 272 days. Mitoxantrone is effective in reducing disease progression through a variety of different mechanisms of action. For example, it suppresses the proliferation of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. It impairs antigen presentation and decreases the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Mitoxantrone enhances T-cell suppressor function and inhibits B-cell function and antibody production. Finally, it inhibits macrophage-mediated myelin degradation. Compared with interferon betas, mitoxantrone has a broad range of actions and has effects on many different types of immune cells.",,"['MS Clinic of Central Texas, 7200 Wyoming Springs Dr., Suite 1100, Round Rock, TX 78681, USA.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used the differential display reverse transcription-PCR method with normal cervical, cervical cancer and metastatic tissues, and cervical cancer cell line to identify genes overexpressed in cancers. RESULTS: We identified a minichromosome maintenance 3 (MCM3) gene that was overexpressed in various human cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinomas of the uterine cervix, colon, lung, stomach, kidney and breast, and malignant melanoma. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses also revealed that MCM3 protein was elevated in most of human cancer tissues tested. We compared the MCM3 protein expression levels in human cancers with conventional proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. MCM3 antibody was the most specific for multiple human cancers, whereas proliferating cell nuclear antigen was relatively less effective in specificity, and Ki-67 failed to detect several human cancers. The down-regulation of MCM3 protein level was examined under serum starvation in both normal and cancer cells. Interestingly, MCM3 protein was stable in MCF-7 breast cancer cells even up to 96 hours after serum starvation, whereas it was gradually degraded in normal BJ fibroblast cells. Nude mice who received injections of HEK 293 cells stably transfected with MCM3 formed tumors in 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that determination of MCM3 expression level will facilitate the assessment of many different human malignancies in tumor diagnosis, and MCM3 is involved in multiple types of human carcino-genesis.",,"['Molecular Genetic Laboratory, Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (MCM3 protein, human)', '0 (Mcm3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, available IMPDH inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), which is known as an immunosuppressant, was shown to induce apoptosis in myeloma cell lines. On the basis of our preclinical studies, we designed a clinical study to test our hypothesis that MMF has antimyeloma activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A Phase I MMF dose escalation study was conducted in relapsed and refractory myeloma patients who had documented disease progression by myeloma markers or bone marrow plasmacytosis to determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, and efficacy of the drug. To assess the activity of IMPDH inhibition in the myeloma cells of patients, we measured intracellular nucleotide triphosphate levels by high-performance liquid chromatography-based analysis and examined the correlation with clinical response. RESULTS: Among the 11 study patients, MMF was generally well tolerated and was administered up to a maximum dose of 5 g/day. The most common toxicity was grade 1 fatigue (n = 4, 36%). One patient had a partial response (3 g/day), four patients had stable disease, and six patients had progression of disease. There was a statistically significant difference in the intracellular dGTP level changes between the stable disease/partial response group versus progression of disease.

Here we show that HTLV-I-transformed T cells progress through S/G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle with a delay. This delay is correlated with a decrease in the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and securin. In tax-expressing cells, the Cdc20-associated anaphase promoting complex (APC(Cdc20)), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls metaphase to anaphase transition, becomes active before cellular entry into mitosis as evidenced by premature cyclin B1 polyubiquitination and degradation during S/G(2). Consistent with the notion that Tax activates APC(Cdc20) directly, Tax is found to coimmunoprecipitate with Cdc20 and Cdc27/APC3.

Epub 2004 Dec 28.,"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is the leading cause of myelopathy in Japan and is diagnosed by ectopic bone formation in the paravertebral ligament. OPLL is a systemic high bone mass disease with a strong genetic background. To detect genes relevant to the pathogenesis of OPLL, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis of systematic gene expression profiles during the osteoblastic differentiation of ligament cells from OPLL patients (OPLL cells), patients with a disorder called ossification of yellow ligament (OYL), and non-OPLL controls together with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) after stimulating them with osteogenic differentiation medium (OS). Twenty-four genes were up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation in OPLL cells. Zinc finger protein 145 (promyelotic leukemia zinc finger or PLZF) was one of the highly expressed genes during osteoblastic differentiation in all the cells examined. We investigated the roles of PLZF in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs and C2C12 cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing of PLZF resulted in a reduction in the expression of osteoblast-specific genes such as the alkaline phosphatase, collagen 1A1 (Col1a1), Runx2/core-binding factor 1 (Cbfa1), and osteocalcin genes, even in the presence of OS in hMSCs. The expression of PLZF was unaffected by the addition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), and the expression of BMP-2 was not affected by PLZF in hMSCs. In C2C12 cells, overexpression of PLZF increased the expression of Cbfa1 and Col1a1; on the other hand, the overexpression of CBFA1 did not affect the expression of Plzf. These findings indicate that PLZF plays important roles in early osteoblastic differentiation as an upstream regulator of CBFA1 and thereby might participate in promoting the ossification of spinal ligament cells in OPLL patients.",,"['Division of Genetic Diagnosis, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,20041228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intensity of silver-stained PCR products was measured by densitometer and analysed using the computer program. RESULTS: The CTMR was significantly higher in MDS (33.65% +/- 23.37%) than in control group (P<0.001), in 9 RAEB(T) (58.35% +/- 17.44%) than in the control and RA groups. Five RA patients who have survived three to ten years without leukemia, have a normal CTMR. Seven of 8 RAEB(T) patients who had a high CTMR of more than 30% evolved into AML in two months.

The alteration detectable by CGH was the over-representation of the Y chromosome in both samples. Interphase FISH were performed using locus (13q14 and 17p53) and centromere (chromosome 12, 17 and Y) specific DNA probes. One brother (patient 1, 69 years of age) showed deletion of the 13q14 region, this alteration was associated with low CD38 expression, both predicting a favourable prognosis.

In this study, clinical data and disease outcomes were analyzed in conjunction with the telomerase activity (TA) and telomere length (TL) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study was carried out in 22 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) (7 chronic and 15 acute types) and in 13 asymptomatic human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) carriers. The mean values of TA in acute and chronic type patients were 13.8 and 1.6 total product generated (TPG) units, respectively, as determined by telomeric repeat amplification assays. The mean TA values in HTLV-1 carriers and healthy volunteers were 1.8 and 0.7 TPG, respectively. The mean TA value in acute type patients was significantly higher than in the three other subject groups. The mean TL values in patients with acute and chronic types were 5.39 and 4.38 Kb, respectively, while the mean TL values in HTLV-1 carriers and healthy volunteers were 7.69 and 7.06 Kb, respectively. The mean TL values in all ATL patients and in non-ATL subjects were 5.2 and 7.3 Kb, respectively. The former value is significantly shorter than the latter (p < 0.01). Neither TA nor TL of ATL cells showed any significant association with the number of ATL cells, serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, or serum lactate dehydrogenase in the peripheral blood of acute type patients. This suggests that the levels of TA and TL did not reflect the ATL tumor load. The median survival period of acute ATL patients with high TA and shortened TL was 0.47 years, however, which was significantly shorter than that of acute ATL patients with low TA and normal TL (4.21 years) (p < 0.002). These data suggest that high TA and shortened TL were associated with poorer prognosis, and that TA and TL may be novel markers for the prognosis of ATL patients.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine II, Faculty of Medicine, University Miyazaki, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan. puyan@fc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp']",['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by the clonal integration of one or more HTLV-1 proviruses in the tumor cells. There are 4 major subtypes of ATLL: a smoldering type, a chronic type, a lymphoma type and a leukemic/acute type. The survival rate of ATLL patients, especially those who develop the acute leukemic or lymphomas forms, is very poor and such a tumor remains one of the most severe lymphoproliferations. Treatment of ATLL patients using conventional chemotherapy has very limited benefit, since HTLV-1 transformed cells are resistant to most apoptosis-inducing agents. Recently, antiretroviral therapy using the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has been shown to induce a high complete remission rate and to prolong the survival of ATLL patients. Based on the current physiopathology, other drugs such as arsenic trioxide combined to IFN-alpha have also been demonstrated to synergize in vitro for inducing apoptosis in HTLV-1 infected T cells.

We used a FMEV retroviral vector for the transfer of AML1/ETO into human CD34 + cells. The repopulation, self-renewal, and differentiation potential of infected cells were assessed in serum-free liquid culture, colony assays, and in transplanted NOD-SCID mice. High transcription levels were confirmed by real-time PCR. AML1-ETO expressing cells were expandable for up to 12 weeks and retained an immature morphology. The capacity for prolonged survival, however, did not abrogate maturation, as AML1-ETO cells gave rise to normal colonies in a CFU-assay. AML1/ETO-expressing cells also contributed to myeloid (CD15, CD33), B-lymphoid (CD20), NK-cell (CD56) and erythroid (GPA) lineages in xenografted NOD/SCID mice. Although able to engraft all major lineages, AML1/ETO transplanted cells were primarily found in less differentiated fractions as measured by cell surface markers CD34 and CD38. In spite of a good engraftment and prolonged observation period none of the NOD/SCID-mice developed an acute myelogenous leukemia.

Since establishment in 1991 the Kasumi-1 cell line has provided the tool to study the peculiar molecular, morphologic, immunophenotypic findings of AML with t(8;21) and the functional consequences of the AML1-ETO fusion oncogene on myeloid differentiation. Leukemogenesis involves multiple genetic changes and, as suggested by murine experiments and other findings in humans, AML1-ETO expression may not be sufficient for full blown leukemia. In agreement with the ""two hits"" model of leukemogenesis, based on the cooperation between 1 class of mutations that impair hematopoietic differentiation and a second class of mutations that confer a proliferative and/or survival advantage to hematopoietic progenitors an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the c-kit gene was identified in the AML1/ETO expressing Kasumi-1 cell line. The dosage of the Asn822Lys mutated allele was shown to be about 5-fold compared to the normal allele and c-kit amplification was found to map to minute 4cen-q11 marker chromosomes, likely derived from the extra chromosome 4 recorded in the newly established cell line. The combination of t(8;21) and trisomy 4 leading to enhanced dosage of a mutated kit allele is a feature of a few CBFL patients reproduced by the Kasumi-1 cell model. The Kasumi-1 cell line, paralleling the commitment stage of CBF leukemia also provides a valuable resource to investigate the effect of tyrosine kinase kit mutant on the main KIT-regulated signal transduction pathways, i.e. MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 and the diverse inhibitory effect exerted by STI 571 on these KIT mutant activated pathways. PI3K-dependent activation of AKT and STAT activation was observed in Kasumi-1 cells. Contrary to the expectations for an amplified tyrosine kinase kit mutant, we found that STI 571 inhibited KIT Asn822Lys tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream JNK and STAT3 effectors in Kasumi-1 cells, but had no effect on constitutive activation of AKT, suggesting that signaling by tyrosine kinases other than KIT may be responsible for its activation in Kasumi-1 cells. Independent findings on the same model system provide complementary insights into designing strategies for treatment of CBF leukemia associated with mutations in the KIT catalytic domain.",,"['Department of Biology and Genetics for Medical Sciences, Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Italy. lidia.larizza@unimi.it']",['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty patients (median age 56, range 25 - 79) were included: 28 (70%) NHL, 9 (23%) HL and 3 (8%) CLL. Fifty-three per cent had received 2 prior treatment regimens.

The frequent manifestation of ATL is infiltration of leukemic cells into various organs. Besides certain cell adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteineses, chemokine receptors may play important roles in tissue infiltration of ATL. Identification of a unique set of chemokine receptors expressed by ATL would thus provide valuable information about the molecular mechanism of tissue infiltration of ATL. This may also reveal that ATL frequently develops from a certain subset of T cells that express a particular set of chemokine receptors. Since HTLV-1 encodes a potent viral transcriptional activator Tax, which is known to induce various cellular genes, expression of some chemokine receptors may be affected by Tax. This, however, may relate more to HTLV-1-infected T cells, since ATL cells usually do not express Tax. Finally, identification of a unique set of chemokine receptors expressed by ATL may also provide a new therapeutic target. These considerations prompted us to examine the chemokine receptor expression in ATL. We found that in the majority of ATL cases, leukemic cells consistently express CCR4. Since CCR4 is known to be involved in T cell migration into skin, this may in part explain the frequent skin infiltration in ATL. Furthermore, CCR4 is known to be selectively expressed by Th2 and regulatory T cells. Thus, the majority of ATL may predominantly originate from either Th2 or regulatory T cells.",,"['Department of Microbiology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. o.yoshie@med.kindai.ac.jp']","['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptoms in mastocytosis result from MC-derived mediators and, less frequently, from destructive infiltration of MCs. Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is a benign disease of the skin and may regress spontaneously. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a persistent disease in which a somatic c-kit mutation at codon 816 is usually detectable in MCs and their progenitors. The clinical course in these patients is variable ranging from asymptomatic for years to highly aggressive and rapidly devastating. The WHO discriminates five categories of SM: indolent SM (ISM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated clonal hematological non-MC-lineage disease (AHNMD), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). The c-kit mutation D816V is quite common and may be found in all SM-categories. In SM-AHNMD, additional genetic abnormalities have been reported, whereas no additional defects are yet known for ASM or MCL. Patients with ISM and CM are treated with ""mediator-targeting"" drugs, whereas patients with ASM or MCL are candidates for cytoreductive therapy. The use of ""Kit-targeting"" tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as STI571 (Imatinib, Gleevec), has also been suggested. However, the D816V mutation of c-kit is associated with relative resistance against STI571. Therefore, these patients require alternative targeted drugs or new drug-combinations.

The objective was to perform a systematic study of chemokine receptor expression on B cells from normal subjects and from patients with a range of BCLPDs. Expression of the above chemokine receptors, and CCR5, were analyzed by flow cytometry on lymphocytes from normal controls (n=20), and samples of follicular centre cell lymphoma (FCCL, n=16), precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Prec-B-ALL, n=16), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n=21), small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL, n=9), hairy cell leukemia (HCL, n=10) and other miscellaneous disorders (n=9). Normal B cells were typically positive for CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR6, negative for CCR5 and variable for CCR7. Prec-B-ALL cells expressed CXCR4 but were negative for the other receptors. B-CLL cells lost expression of CCR6 but showed strong expression of CCR7. In contrast, SLL cells failed to express CCR7, but were otherwise similar to CLL cells. HCL cells showed absence of CXCR5 and CCR7, but interestingly all but one case expressed CCR5, whilst CD25-negative ""variant"" HCL cells did not express CCR5. FCCL cells down-regulated CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression and lost expression of CCR6 and CCR7. CXCR3 expression was highly variable on normal B-cells and on cells from BCLPDs, possibly due to its lability during processing. Distinct changes in chemokine receptor expression accompany B-cell development, whilst some BCLPDs show characteristic alterations that may be useful in phenotyping and in understanding biological behavior.",,"['Flow Cytometry Unit, Institue of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']","['0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten cases with normal peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) were selected as control group. Cytogenetic analyses were available in 21 patients with leukemia. In all cases with acute leukemia and in control group, peripheral blood (PB) hTERT levels correlated significantly with bone marrow (BM) hTERT levels. Before treatment, patients with ALL had significantly higher hTERT levels than that of AML patients and control cases. Among patients with ALL, higher hTERT levels were observed in patients with pre-B leukemia, followed by B cell and T cell leukemia patients. Initially increased hTERT levels decreased to the nearly normal levels during remission in cases with ALL. No correlation was observed between the initial hTERT levels and the known prognostic factors except cytogenetic findings. Higher hTERT levels were detected in patients having karyotypic abnormalities which indicate poor prognosis. hTERT levels are significantly high in childhood ALL with the highest level of pre-B cell leukemia before treatment.

Since infections are the major cause of mortality in CLL, we investigated the effect of the mutation status on host immunity and proneness to infections in patients with CLL. As expected, the disease progression seemed to be faster and the disease more advanced (Binet B and C) among unmutated patients than in the mutated ones. Surprisingly, no differences in humoral immunity [immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, IgG subclasses, anti-ABO blood group antibodies and mannan-binding lectin (MBL)] or immune responses (Haemophilus influenzae serotype b conjugate vaccination) were detected between these 2 patient groups. Furthermore, UM-patients were not more prone to infections compared to M-patients, and therapy had no impact on the incidence and pattern of infections in either of the patient groups.

However, treatment-related toxicity and, in patients with advanced MDS (RAEB, RAEB-T) and those who have transformed to AML (tAML), post-transplant relapse continues to be problematic. We reviewed results in 128 patients with advanced MDS and tAML transplanted from HLA-identical related or unrelated donors after preparation with myeloablative conditioning regimens. Seventy-eight patients were conditioned with busulfan (Bu), prescribed dose 16 mg/kg, adjusted to achieve plasma concentrations of 800-900 ng/ml, plus cyclophosphamide (Cy), 2 x 60 mg/kg [tBuCy], and 50 patients were conditioned with Bu 7 mg/kg (without dose adjustment) and total body irradiation (TBI) 6 x 200 cGy given over 3 days [BuTBI]. There was no statistically significant difference in regards to overall survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), or non-relapse mortality (NRM) between the 2 regimens regardless of donor status. However, there was a trend towards higher rates of relapse (HR 1.33, P=0.38) and lower rates of NRM (HR 0.61, P=0.09) in patients conditioned with tBuCy. The increased rate of relapse seen with tBuCy was significant when restricted to only those patients with a diagnosis of RAEB (HR 4.50, P=0.02). Patients given BuTBI had a higher incidence of GvHD; however, the incidence of GvHD regardless of grade did not differ significantly between patients who relapsed and those who did not. Thus, in patients with advanced MDS/tAML, the use of a less toxic conditioning regimen resulted in a non-significant overall gain in RFS largely due to lower rates of NRM.

It is focused in particular on the effects of As2O3 in non-APL cells. Since As2O3 seems to induce apoptosis and inhibits growth in a large variety of cellular targets, it might become an alternative or adjunct drug to conventional chemotherapy. As2O3 can even be effective in cells resistant to conventional cytostatic agents.

When recovered from peripheral blood or lymphoid tissues from the patient and cultured in vitro, these malignant cells rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis. This observation suggests that the selective survival advantage enjoyed by CLL B-cells is not entirely autonomous, raising the possibility of manipulating CLL B-cell survival by iatrogenic means. The extended survival of the neoplastic B-cells creates a permissive soil on which oncogene activation, genetic instability and accumulation of gene mutations favoring disease progression can occur. In addition, such survival-promoting microenvironments can rescue leukemia cells from cytotoxic therapy, giving way to disease relapse. Survival of CLL B-cells is influenced by interactions with non-leukemia cells in the microenvironment of lymph nodes, marrow and other tissues. CLL B-cells have developed many different ways to escape undergoing apoptosis. These include: (a) expression of survival receptor as well as their ligands, giving rise to autocrine survival pathways which are leukemia cell specific; (b) defects in plasma membrane receptor cell signaling, triggered by death receptors such as Fas- and TRAIL; and (c) constitutively active survival signaling pathways such as NFkappaB and PI3K/Akt. Here we discuss some of the molecular mechanisms by which interaction with other cells and factors in the microenvironment provides survival advantages to CLL B-cells in specific in vivo niches, and we suggest some strategies for overcoming these anti-apoptotic mechanisms for improving treatment of CLL.",,"['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, small numbers of ""atypical"" lymphocytes and prolymphocytes (PL) are frequently observed in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with CLL. In this study, we examined BM biopsy and aspirate specimens obtained from seven patients with atypical CLL. Using a double labeling (Ki-67+/CD20+) immunohistochemical method, we found that an appreciable number of the atypical CLL cells expressed the proliferation-associated protein Ki-67. Because CLL is characterized by a slow change in the peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte count, we reasoned that a subpopulation of CLL cells probably undergoes spontaneous apoptosis. Using Western blot analysis, we observed expression of procaspase-9, procaspase-10, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by the neoplastic cells in all seven cases of CLL, and procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 expression in six neoplasms. We also detected cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in four and five CLL cases, respectively. To determine whether CLL cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis, we performed the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using BM biopsy specimens. We found TUNEL-positive lymphocytes in areas infiltrated by CLL.

Then the numbers of positive wells were counted and the cell plating efficiency, relative suspension growth and mutation frequency were determined. RESULT: Total alkaloids of THH (0.1-2.0 g x L(-1)) induced tk locus mutation with mutation frequency 2-9 times higher than that of spontaneous mutation frequency of L5178Y cells.

A high-resolution contig array was developed specifically for chromosome 8q because this chromosome arm is frequently altered in many human cancers. METHODS: A minimal tiling path contig of 702 8q-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones was generated with a novel computational tool (BAC Contig Assembler). BAC clones were amplified by degenerative oligonucleotide primer (DOP) polymerase chain reaction and subsequently printed onto glass slides. For validation of the array DNA samples of gastroesophageal and prostate cancer cell lines, and chronic myeloid leukemia specimens were used, which were previously characterized by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization and conventional CGH. RESULTS: Single and double copy gains were confidently demonstrated with the 8q array. Single copy loss and high-level amplifications were accurately detected and confirmed by bicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments. The 8q array was further tested with paraffin-embedded prostate cancer specimens. In these archival specimens, the copy number changes were confirmed. In fresh and archival samples, additional alterations were disclosed. In comparison with conventional CGH, the resolution of the detected changes was much improved, which was demonstrated by an amplicon of 0.7 Mb and a deletion of 0.6 Mb, both spanned by only six BAC clones. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive array is presented, which provides a high-resolution method for mapping copy number alterations on chromosome 8q.",,"['Department of Pathology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Fixatives)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",,,['CA89520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered chromatin function can lead to aberrant expression of growth regulators and may, ultimately, cause cancer. That many human diseases have epigenetic etiology has stimulated the development of 'epigenetic' therapies. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACIs) induce proliferation arrest, maturation and apoptosis of cancer cells, but not normal cells, in vitro and in vivo, and are currently being tested in clinical trials. We investigated the mechanism(s) underlying this tumor selectivity. We report that HDACIs induce, in addition to p21, expression of TRAIL (Apo2L, TNFSF10) by directly activating the TNFSF10 promoter, thereby triggering tumor-selective death signaling in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and the blasts of individuals with AML. RNA interference revealed that the induction of p21, TRAIL and differentiation are separable activities of HDACIs. HDACIs induced proliferation arrest, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and suppression of AML blast clonogenicity irrespective of French-American-British (FAB) classification status, karyotype and immunophenotype. No apoptosis was seen in normal CD34(+) progenitor cells.

The induction of apoptosis by UV radiation, as well as a variety of genotoxic stimuli, involves the activation of PKC-delta by caspase-3-mediated cleavage in its hinge region, thus generating a constitutively active catalytic fragment. To determine the role of PKC-delta cleavage in UV apoptosis signaling, we introduced a caspase-resistant PKC-delta mutant (D330A) into human keratinocytes by retrovirus transduction. Overexpression of PKC-delta(D330A) protected keratinocytes from UV-induced apoptosis and enhanced long-term survival. PKC-delta(D330A) partially prevented the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the loss of Mcl-1, a key antiapoptotic protein downregulated during UV apoptosis.

The constitutive activation of Stat3 leads to a constitutive expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-3. In healthy cells, SOCS-3 is transiently expressed following cytokine stimulation and functions as a negative feedback inhibitor of the Stat3-activating kinases. Here, we attempt to resolve the apparent paradox of a simultaneous SOCS-3 expression and Stat3 activation in the same cells. We show that (i) SOCS-3 expression in tumour cells is equal to or higher than in cytokine-stimulated nonmalignant T cells, (ii) SOCS-3 is not mutated in CTCL, (iii) overexpression of SOCS-3 blocks IFNalpha-mediated growth inhibition without affecting Stat3 activation, growth, and apoptosis, and (iv) inhibition of SOCS-3 by a dominant negative Stat3 (Stat3D) increases the IFNalpha-mediated growth inhibition. Taken together, these data show that SOCS-3 does not inhibit Stat3 activation, growth, and survival in CTCL. In contrast, SOCS3 protects tumour cells against growth inhibition by IFNalpha.

Traditional statistical testing approaches, such as the two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon test, are frequently used for evaluating statistical significance of informative expressions but require adjustment for large-scale multiplicity. Due to its simplicity, Bonferroni adjustment has been widely used to circumvent this problem. It is well known, however, that the standard Bonferroni test is often very conservative. In the present paper, we compare three multiple testing procedures in the microarray context: the original Bonferroni method, a Bonferroni-type improved single-step method and a step-down method. The latter two methods are based on nonparametric resampling, by which the null distribution can be derived with the dependency structure among gene expressions preserved and the family-wise error rate accurately controlled at the desired level. We also present a sample size calculation method for designing microarray studies. Through simulations and data analyses, we find that the proposed methods for testing and sample size calculation are computationally fast and control error and power precisely.",,"['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Box 2716, Durham, NC 27705, USA. jung0005@mc.duke.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated if FL and its receptor, Flt3, functionally interact with CXCL12/CXCR4 to regulate hematopoietic cell migration. FL stimulated chemokinetic activity when used alone, but synergistically enhanced short-term migration of CD34+ cells, Ba/F3 cells expressing human Flt3 (Ba/F3-Flt3), and human RS4;11 acute leukemia cells, induced by CXCL12. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively activated internal tandem duplication (ITD)-Flt3 mutants in Ba/F3 cells dramatically enhanced migration toward CXCL12. In Ba/F3-Flt3 cells, synergistic cell migration to FL plus CXCL12 was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/p44 (MAPK(p42/p44)), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB), and Akt, and was partially inhibited by pretreatment of cells with selective inhibitors for MAPK(p42/p44), protein kinase A (PKA), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), implicating these pathways in migration to FL plus CXCL12. In contrast, prolonged exposure of CD34+ or Ba/F3-Flt3 cells to FL down-regulated CXCR4 expression, inhibited CXCL12-mediated phosphorylation of MAPK(p42/p44), CREB, and Akt, and impaired migration toward CXCL12. These findings suggest that FL/Flt3 may facilitate hematopoietic cell migration/homing and mobilization by enhancing or inhibiting CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathways and that the FL/Flt3 axis participates in trafficking of normal and transformed hematopoietic cells.",,"['Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. sfukuda@iupui.edu']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",,20041223,"['DK53674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL67384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL69669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL79654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescent microscopic analysis of living rag2-EGFP-bcl-2 transgenic fish showed that their thymocytes were resistant to irradiation- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, when compared with control rag2-GFP transgenic zebrafish. To test the ability of bcl-2 to block irradiation-induced apoptosis in malignant cells, we compared the responsiveness of Myc-induced leukemias with and without EGFP-bcl-2 expression in living transgenic zebrafish. T-cell leukemias induced by the rag2-EGFP-Myc transgene were ablated by irradiation, whereas leukemias in double transgenic fish expressing both Myc and EGFP-bcl-2 were resistant to irradiation-induced apoptotic cell death.

While most of these responses are stable, resistance to treatment after an initial response is common in more advanced phases of the disease. Mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR-ABL that impair imatinib binding have been identified as the leading cause of resistance. Patients with CCR who achieve a profound reduction of BCR-ABL mRNA have a very low risk of disease progression. However, residual disease usually remains detectable with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), indicating that disease eradication may pose a significant challenge.

Epub 2004 Dec 23.,"The human population is continually exposed to benzene due to its presence in complex environmental mixtures and exposure has been linked to a range of haematotoxic effects, including an increased risk of leukaemia. Several hypotheses have been postulated on how benzene exerts its toxic and carcinogenic effects, one idea being that following metabolism to more reactive species it can react with DNA to form adducts which subsequently give rise to mutations. Previously, we have demonstrated the formation of four major DNA adducts from the reaction of DNA with the benzene metabolites hydroquinone (HQ) and p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) and the mutagenicity of these adducts when analysed using the supF forward mutation assay after replication in a human kidney cell line. This study demonstrates a potential role in the carcinogenicity of benzene for the DNA adducts formed on 2'-deoxyguanosine 3'-monophosphate. As a continuation of this work, benzene metabolite-treated plasmid pSP189 containing the supF reporter gene was transfected into human nucleotide excision repair (NER)-proficient and NER-deficient (xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group A) fibroblast cells to determine the method of adduct repair. For all metabolite treatments in both cell lines the majority of mutations were single base substitutions occurring at GC base pairs, predominantly GC-->TA transversions and GC-->AT transitions. Comparison of mutation frequencies showed a similarity for the HQ treatment for the two cell lines, whereas for the treatments involving p-BQ, an overall higher mutation frequency was observed in the NER-deficient cells compared with the NER-proficient cells. Mutation spectra were significantly different following treatment with HQ in the two cell lines (P = 0.0004). No difference was observed for the control, p-BQ or the combined treatment. The results suggest the involvement of a different repair mechanism for HQ-induced DNA damage and further highlights the potential different roles for the two benzene metabolites in benzene mutagenicity.",,"['Cancer Biomarkers and Prevention Group, The Biocentre, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK. mg24@le.ac.uk']","['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (supF tRNA)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,20041223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of CD19+/CD5+ B-lymphocytes primarily through a block in apoptosis. The mechanisms underlying this defect are not fully understood. We investigated whether LPA could be a survival factor in CLL cells. Herein, we demonstrate that LPA protects B-cell lines BJAB and I-83 and primary CLL cells but not normal B-cells from fludarabine- and etoposide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, LPA prevented spontaneous apoptosis in primary CLL cells. The LPA1 expression was found to be increased in primary CLL cells compared with normal B-cells correlating with LPA prevention of apoptosis. Treatment of primary CLL cells with the LPA receptor antagonist, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, reverses the protective effect of LPA against apoptosis, and down-regulation of the LPA1 by siRNA blocked LPA-mediated protection against spontaneous apoptosis in primary CLL cells. The protective effect of LPA was inhibited by blocking activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway. These results indicate that LPA is a survival factor in B-cell lines and primary CLL cells but not normal B-cells. Thus, drugs targeting the LPA receptors might be an effective therapy against B-cell-derived malignancies such as CLL.",,"['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E 0V9, Canada.']","['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'PG6M3969SG (lysophosphatidic acid)']",,20041223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the treatment of pediatric ALL is centered on tailoring the intensity of the therapy applied to a patient's risk of relapse, which is linked to the type of leukemia the patient has. Hence, accurate and correct diagnosis of the various leukemia subtypes becomes an important first step in the treatment process. Recently, gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays has been shown to be a viable and accurate diagnostic tool to identify the known prognostically important ALL subtypes. Thus, there is currently a huge interest in developing autonomous classification systems for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data. This is to achieve an unbiased analysis of the data and also partly to handle the large amount of genetic information extracted from the DNA microarrays. METHODOLOGY: Generally, existing medical decision support systems (DSS) for cancer classification and diagnosis are based on traditional statistical methods such as Bayesian decision theory and machine learning models such as neural networks (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Though high accuracies have been reported for these systems, they fall short on certain critical areas. These included (a) being able to present the extracted knowledge and explain the computed solutions to the users; (b) having a logical deduction process that is similar and intuitive to the human reasoning process; and (c) flexible enough to incorporate new knowledge without running the risk of eroding old but valid information. On the other hand, a neural fuzzy system, which is synthesized to emulate the human ability to learn and reason in the presence of imprecise and incomplete information, has the ability to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. However, existing neural fuzzy systems have their own limitations when used in the design and implementation of DSS. Hence, this paper proposed the use of a novel neural fuzzy system: the generic self-organising fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN) with truth-value restriction (TVR) fuzzy inference, as a fuzzy DSS (denoted as GenSo-FDSS) for the classification of ALL subtypes using gene expression data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The performance of the GenSo-FDSS system is encouraging when benchmarked against those of NN, SVM and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier. On average, a classification rate of above 90% has been achieved using the GenSo-FDSS system.",,"['Centre for Computational Intelligence, School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Blk N4 #2A-32, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore. wltung@pmail.ntu.edu.sg']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the function of scl during zebrafish hematopoietic and endothelial development, we utilized site-directed, anti-sense morpholinos to inhibit scl mRNA. Knockdown of scl resulted in a loss of primitive and definitive hematopoietic cell lineages. However, the expression of early hematopoietic genes, gata2 and lmo2, was unaffected, suggesting that hematopoietic cells were present but unable to further differentiate. Using gene expression analysis and visualization of vessel formation in live animals harboring an lmo2 promoter-green fluorescent protein reporter transgene (Tg(lmo2:EGFP)), we show that angioblasts were specified normally in the absence of scl, but later defects in angiogenesis were evident. While scl was not required for angioblast specification, forced expression of exogenous scl caused an expansion of both hematopoietic and endothelial gene expression, and a loss of somitic tissue. In cloche and spadetail mutants, forced expression of scl resulted in an expansion of hematopoietic but not endothelial tissue. Surprisingly, in cloche, lmo2 was not induced in response to scl over-expression. Taken together, these findings support distinct roles for scl in hematopoietic and endothelial development, downstream of hemangioblast development.",,"[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]","['0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '0 (lmo2 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tbx16 protein, zebrafish)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 23.,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transplantation of insulin-producing beta cells from donors can cure diabetes, but they are available in insufficient quantities. In this study, we investigated the possibility of generating insulin-producing cells from adult rat exocrine cells cultured in the presence of growth factors. METHODS: Rat exocrine pancreatic cells were isolated and treated in vitro with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Analysis was performed by immunocytochemistry, DNA measurement and radioimmunoassay. Cells were transplanted to alloxan-treated (70 mg/kg) nude mice and glycaemia was monitored for 21 days. Nephrectomy was performed on day 15. RESULTS: In a 3-day culture period, addition of LIF plus EGF to the medium resulted in an 11-fold increase of the beta cell mass. This could not be attributed to the very low mitotic activity of contaminating beta cells. Furthermore, when contaminating beta cells were initially destroyed with alloxan, this effect was even more pronounced. The newly formed cells secreted insulin in response to glucose and were immunoreactive for C-peptide-I, Pdx-1 and GLUT-2, which are characteristics of mature beta cells. Electron microscopy showed that they also contained insulin-immunoreactive secretory granules. Some insulin-positive cells were immunoreactive for amylase and cytokeratin-20, or were binucleated, which are characteristics of exocrine cells. The cells were able to restore normoglycaemia when transplanted to alloxan-diabetic mice, and hyperglycaemia recurred upon removal of the graft. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that functional beta cells can be generated from exocrine tissue by transdifferentiation and thereby may offer a new perspective for beta cell therapy.",,"['Cell Differentiation Unit, Free University of Brussels, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.']","['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,20041223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this MPD murine model, we examined the feasibility of systemic antiangiogenic gene therapy for hematological malignancy. An adenoviral vector containing the secretable endostatin gene was injected into the right quadriceps muscle of the MPD mice. The increased endostatin level was detected for at least 6 months.

Infiltration of megakaryocytes was also significantly inhibited in treated MPD mice. Reduction of the microvessel density was confirmed by histological examination.

The contemporary presence of CLL, adenocarcinoma of the prostate and residual prostatic gland after transurethral resection has never been reported before and the authors illustrate how they managed this unusual patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-years-old white man, presented with acute urinary retention, had a peripheral blood count with an elevated lymphocytosis (21.250/mL) with a differential of 65.3% lymphocytes and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 3.38 ng/mL with a percent free PSA of 8.28%. The transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) indicated an isoechonic and homogenic enlarged prostate of 42 cm3 and the abdomen ultrasound found a modest splenomegaly and no peripheral lymphadenophaty. The patient underwent transurethral resection of the prostate and had a pathological finding of adenocarcinoma in the prostate with a Gleason Score 4 (2+2) of less than 5% of the material (clinical stage T1a), associated with a diffused infiltration of chronic lymphocitic leukemia elements. CONCLUSIONS: The incidental finding of a prostatic localization of a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma does not modify eventually further treatments for neither prostate cancer nor lymphoma. The presence of a low-grade and low-stage lymphoma, confirmed by a hematological evaluation, and the simultaneous evidence of an adenocarcinoma after transurethral resection of the prostate for acute urinary retention do not require any immediate treatment due to its long-term survival rate and the follow-up remains based on periodical PSA evaluation and complete blood count.",,"[""Divisione Clinicizzata d'Urologia, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. riccardo.ballario@virgilio.it""]",,,20041222,,,,,,PMC544353,,,,,,,,,,,,

The K(i) of the AMT analogue (9) against human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was 34 pM, whereas that of the MTX analogue (10) was 2100 pM. Both compounds were less potent than the parent drugs. However, although the difference between AMT and MTX was <2-fold, the difference between 9 and 10 was 62-fold, suggesting that the effect of N(10)-methyl substitution is amplified in the bridged compounds.

In this study we assessed lymphocyte subpopulation disturbances during maintenance for childhood ALL along with the incidence, type, and severity of infections that occur during that period in the absence of neutropenia. Twenty-eight children (13 boys, 15 girls) with ALL aged 3-14 years (median 7 years) and treated according to the ALL-BFM 90/95 protocol were studied during maintenance for ALL. Complete white blood cell (WBC) counts and peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) analyses were performed. Major lymphocyte subsets (CD19+, CD3+CD4+, CD3-CD8+, CD3-CD16+CD56+, CD45RA-, CD45RO+) and markers of T-cell activation (CD25, CD38, CD69, HLA-DR) were analyzed with flow cytometry. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM levels were measured by a nephelometric assay. All infectious episodes during the study period were recorded in detail. Additionally, 41 age-matched immunocompetent children were used as controls. Absolute WBC counts (median, 3627/microL) and PBL counts (median, 1206/microL) were significantly below the age-adjusted control values (7400/microL and 2673/microL, respectively; P < .0001). B-lymphocyte, total CD4+, and memory CD4+ (CD4+CD45RO+) subsets were also significantly decreased (33/microL versus 377/microL [P < .0001], 531/microL versus 1045/microL [P < .01], and 80/microL versus 299/microL [P < .001], respectively). Significantly lower immunoglobulin levels were found in all patients. Twenty-two of the 28 patients presented with 74 episodes of a variety o minor infections (mostly respiratory viral [39], skin [7], and gastrointestinal [3]), none demanding prolonged hospital treat ment.

Epub 2004 Dec 22.,"We developed a fusion toxin, DT388IL3, consisting of the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin (DT388) linked to interleukin 3 (IL3) for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our goal in this study was to estimate a range for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of DT388IL3 in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasicularis), which possess cross-reactive IL3 receptors. In our previous study, we administered up to six infusions of DT388IL3 at 40, 60, or 100 microg/kg every other day to three pairs (one male monkey and one female monkey) of young adult monkeys. In five of six monkeys, results showed a dose-dependent increase in malaise and anorexia but no consistent abnormalities in serum chemistries or blood counts. There was no evidence of organ damage by blood tests or histopathology. However, the female treated at 100 microg/kg, died of moderate to severe vasculitis of multiple tissues. Based on these findings, this study repeated the 100 microg/kg group and added a group that received 150 microg/kg in an effort to confirm a dose response. Two female monkeys were treated with up to six infusions of DT388IL3 at 100 microg/kg or 150 microg/kg every other day. One additional female monkey was treated as a negative control. Monkeys in the 100 microg/kg group showed moderate malaise and anorexia, but no consistent abnormalities in blood counts or serum chemistries. Moderate elevations of liver enzymes were noted in the 150 microg/kg group in addition to severe malaise and anorexia. No significant findings were revealed at gross necropsy. The histopathological findings revealed regenerative myeloid hyperplasia and hepatic degeneration and regeneration in the 150 microg/kg group. Similar lesions of less severity were detected in the 100 microg/kg group. DT388IL3 plasma half-life was approximately 20 min with a peak concentration of approximately 2 microg/ml (30,000 pM). The IC50 for AML blasts in vitro was 6 pM. Collectively, our results suggest that DT388IL3 can be tolerated at doses up to 100 microg/kg in a nonhuman primate, which is higher than previously reported for other AML directed diphtheria toxin fusion proteins, and should in principle allow for dose escalation with reduced toxic side effects.

To identify potential targets as modulators in MTX chemotherapy, we determined gene expression profiles upon MTX treatment. MATERIAL/METHODS: Expression profiles in human erythroleukemia K562 cells were determined after short treatment with MTX or once resistance to MTX was established. Screening was performed using the Atlas Human Cancer 1.2K arrays (BD-Clontech) containing 1176 cancer-related cDNAs. Specific software (Atlas Image 2.0.1 and Gene Spring 6.1) was used to analyze the expression level for each gene in each condition. Results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR, and the cytotoxicity of the different treatments was assessed by the MTT assay. RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes were selected considering a factor of 2 with respect to their expression in control cells. Eight genes were found to be overexpressed and 14 underexpressed both in MTX-treated and resistant cells. Among the overexpressed genes we chose 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH2) for further validation. Changes in IMPDH2 mRNA levels were confirmed and functional analyses were performed by inhibiting IMPDH with either benzamide riboside, mycophenolic acid, or tiazofurin. These inhibitors sensitized resistant K562 cells to MTX cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of IMPDH2 is increased in K562 cells upon short treatment with MTX and once resistance to MTX is established. Benzamide riboside, mycophenolic acid, and tiazofurin could act as modulators of MTX chemotherapy in K562 cells.",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Pharmacy, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMPDH2 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the gastrointestinal tract is a target of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), colorectal cancer might be a candidate for allo-SCT. METHODS: Four patients with metastatic colorectal cancer underwent reduced-intensity stem-cell transplantation (RIST) in the National Cancer Center Hospital between July 2002 and February 2003. Three patients received transplants from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related donor, and the remaining patient received selected CD34-positive cells from a two-loci HLA-mismatched donor. The basis of preparative regimen was busulfan 4 mg/kg for 2 days and fludarabine 25 mg/kg for 6 days. RESULTS: All the patients tolerated the preparative regimen and achieved engraftment without significant toxicities. All developed acute or chronic GvHD. Although serum levels of CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were transiently elevated after RIST in all the patients, the levels subsequently decreased below the levels from before RIST in all but one patient. Three had measurable lesions before RIST, one achieved partial response, and the others stable disease, which was durable for 120 and 60 days. Three patients died; the causes of death were progressive disease, GvHD, and accident. Postmortem examination was obtained for two patients; in one patient, the peritoneal metastatic lesions macroscopically disappeared, and in the other patient, the supraclavicular lymph node disappeared while the other measurable lesions remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: All the patients showed some evidence suggesting the presence of a graft-versus-tumor effect for colorectal cancer, which should be confirmed in a future prospective trial.",,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (CA-19-9 Antigen)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of CLL cells to stimulate T cells was increased significantly by the protein kinase C (PKC) agonist phorbol myristic acetate (PMA). However, under serum-free conditions, PMA-activated CLL cells died within 48 hours. Antioxidants, such as 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), or fetal calf serum could prevent the death of these cells but caused them to enter distinct states of differentiation. In the presence of 2-ME, PMA-activated CLL cells extended dendritic-like protrusions and exhibited increased T-cell stimulatory capacity. In the presence of serum, PMA-activated CLL cells developed fewer dendrites, made less IL-10 and more IL-12 p40 mRNA transcripts, and showed an increased capacity to induce IFN-gamma production by T cells. The effects of serum on the promotion of type 1 immune responses by phorbol ester-activated CLL cells were dominant and correlated with activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Other PKC agonists, such as Bryostatin-1 and a synthetic Bryostatin analog (Picolog), had similar effects on CLL cells. The observation that CLL cells can acquire features of dendritic cells that promote type 1 immunity may find clinical application in immunotherapeutic strategies for this disease.",,"[""Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center, 2075 Bayview Avenue, Toronto, Canada M4N 3M5.""]","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (picolog)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['CA31845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a population-based case-control study of early childhood cancer (age 0-4 years) among California children born between 1990 and 1997 and mother's residential proximity to agricultural applications of pesticides at the time of the child's birth. METHODS: Included in the study were 2189 case children and 4335 controls matched for birth date and sex. We estimated the in utero exposure potential from specific chemicals and chemical groups used in the 9 months before birth within a half mile of the maternal residence. We computed odds ratios (ORs) using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: No striking patterns emerged. There were modestly elevated ORs for leukemias associated with probable and possible carcinogen use, and with nearby agricultural applications of organochlorines and organophosphates during pregnancy. Two commonly used pesticides were associated with higher leukemia risk when comparing the highest and lowest categories: metam sodium (OR=2.05; 95% confidence interval=1.01-4.17) and dicofol (1.83; 1.05-3.22).

Patients were required to have received no more than three prior chemotherapy regimens, with at least 1 month since the prior treatment, 3 months from prior rituximab, and 7 days from prior corticosteroids; absolute neutrophil count more than 1,500/microL (500/microL if documented bone marrow involvement); and platelet count more than 50,000/microL. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were registered, of whom 24 were assessable. Ten patients had follicular lymphoma, 11 had MCL, three had small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and two had marginal zone lymphoma. The overall response rate was 58%, with one complete remission (CR), one unconfirmed CR (CRu), and four partial remissions (PR) among patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). All responses were durable, lasting from 3 to 24+ months. One patient with MCL achieved a CRu, four achieved a PR, and four had stable disease. One patient with MCL maintained his remission for 19 months. Both patients with marginal zone lymphoma achieved PR lasting 8+ and 11+ months, respectively. Patients with SLL or CLL have yet to respond. Overall, the drug was well tolerated, with only one grade 4 toxicity (hyponatremia). The most common grade 3 toxicities were lymphopenia (n = 14) and thrombocytopenia (n = 7). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bortezomib was well tolerated and has significant single-agent activity in patients with certain subtypes of NHL.",,"['Department of Medicine, Lymphoma and Developmental Chemotherapy Services, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA. oconnoro@mskcc.org']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",,20041221,['UO1 CA 69913/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb 1;23(4):657-8.

Epub 2004 Dec 21.,"This work addresses the question whether CD38, a negative prognostic marker in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), plays a role in neoplastic B-cell growth and survival. We show that CD38+ B-CLL cells bind to murine fibroblasts transfected with the CD31 ligand. The interaction triggers an extensive remodeling of the B-CLL membrane, with relocalization of BCR/CD19 to the CD38/CD31 contact areas, and it also increases cell survival and proliferation. A second event is the up-modulation of the survival receptor CD100, restricted to proliferating cells, and a concomitant decrease of CD72 (low-affinity CD100 ligand and negative regulator of immune responses). The most efficient signals are delivered through sequential interactions between CD38/CD31 and CD100/plexin-B1 (high-affinity CD100 ligand), as inferred by coculture experiments using specific transfectants and blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The finding that nurselike cells from B-CLL patients express CD31 and plexin-B1, which deliver growth and survival signals to CD38+/CD100+ B-CLL cells, further confirms the model proposed. These findings show that a set of normal receptors and ligands ruling physiologic signaling pathways in B lymphocytes becomes detrimental when expressed in the context of B-CLL cells, ultimately leading to the generation of a tumor reservoir.",,"['Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino Medical School, Torino, Italy.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD100 antigen)', '0 (CD72 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PLXNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Semaphorins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,20041221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 21.,"Proteasome inhibitors exhibit antitumor activity against malignancies of different histology. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that antiapoptotic factors may also accumulate as a consequence of exposure to these drugs, possibly reducing their cytotoxicity. These include the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, whose down-regulation has been proposed to initiate apoptosis in response to genotoxic stimuli. In this study, we found that proteasome inhibitors release cyotochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC)/Diablo and trigger the subsequent apoptotic cascade in spite of concomitant Mcl-1 increase. However, our data indicate that subtraction of Mcl-1 during apoptosis, although not required for early release of proapoptotic factors, is probably relevant in speeding up cell demise, since RNA interference-mediated Mcl-1 silencing is lethal in lymphoma cells. Consistent with this, the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors are enhanced when Mcl-1 increase is impeded. Thus, this study identifies Mcl-1 accumulation as an unwanted molecular consequence of exposure to proteasome inhibitors, which slows down their proapoptotic effects. Pharmacologic or genetic approaches targeting Mcl-1, including therapeutic RNAi, may increase the effectiveness of these compounds.",,"['Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Biology, Center for Cancer Research, Cambridge, MA, USA. a.nencioni@gmx.net']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SC5b-9 protein complex)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'Y0900I3U8U (epoxomicin)']",,20041221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All selected Env variants mediated the infectivity of HIV-1 vector particles and encoded novel cytoplasmic tail motifs.

Unlike vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped vectors, they are not neutralized by complement and do not appear to cause significant tissue damage. Here we report the production of murine oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). When optimized, these pseudotypes achieve titers of 10(6) CFU/ml, which is 5- to 10-fold higher than for previous vectors pseudotyped with envelope proteins from other alphaviruses. They can also be concentrated or stored frozen without significant loss of infectivity. Consistent with the tropism of the envelope donor, they transduce a broad array of human cell types, including lung epithelial cells, neuronal cells, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. Infection is blocked by agents that inhibit endosomal acidification and by neutralizing antibodies against VEEV. These observations indicate that the pseudotypes present native epitopes on their surface and enter through a VEEV envelope-dependent, pH-sensitive mechanism. The fact that the pseudotypes are unaffected by sera reactive to other alphaviruses indicates that they may be useful when successive gene therapies are required in the presence of an active immune response. In this case, having an array of alphavirus-based vectors with similar cell tropisms would be highly advantageous. These vectors may also be useful in diagnostic assays in which infectious VEEV is undesirable but immune reactivity to native epitopes is required.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Blvd., Galveston, TX 77555, USA.']","['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,['U54 AI057156/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC538582,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that IL-1beta can induce cell cycle arrest and differentiation in the human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line, TT. IL-1beta induces cell cycle arrest accompanied by morphological changes and expression of the neuroendocrine marker calcitonin. These changes are blocked by the MEK1/2 specific inhibitor U0126, indicating that MEK1/2 is essential for IL-1beta signaling in TT cells. IL-1beta induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and activation of STAT3 via the MEK/ERK pathway. This activation of STAT3 could be abrogated by treatment with anti-LIF neutralizing antibody or anti-gp130 blocking antibody, indicating that induction of LIF expression is sufficient and essential for STAT3 activation by IL-1beta. In addition to activation of the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway, IL-1beta also induced an MEK/ERK-mediated intracellular cell-autonomous signaling pathway that is independently sufficient for growth arrest and differentiation. Thus, IL-1beta activates the MEK/ERK pathway to induce growth arrest and differentiation in MTC cells via dual independent signaling mechanisms, the cell-extrinsic LIF/JAK/STAT pathway, and the cell-intrinsic autonomous signaling pathway.",,"['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, CRB572, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. jpark15@jhmi.edu']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 2)']",,20041201,['R01-CA85567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the importance of core-binding factor in megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet production, as well as the central role of megakaryocytes in the pathophysiology of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM), we hypothesised that RUNX1 gene mutations might be common in MMM. In addition, it is unclear whether patients with MDS-associated acquired alpha thalassaemia (ATMDS), a special subgroup with a very high incidence of point mutations in the ATRX gene, have an especially high incidence of RUNX1 mutations. METHODS: We analysed samples from 78 patients for RUNX1 point mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC): 26 with MMM and 52 with MDS, including 18 with ATMDS. RESULTS: We found five RUNX1 mutations in MDS patients (9.6%), all of whom had RAEB-2 or a history of treated AML, but none in MMM patients.

Proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is constitutively secreted by the AML blasts for a subset of patients, but it can also be released by non-leukemic bone marrow cells. METHODS: VEGF levels were determined after coculture of native human AML blasts with fibroblast lines, osteoblastic sarcoma cell lines, normal bone marrow stromal cells and normal osteoblasts. Cultures were prepared with leukemic and non-leukemic cells separated by a semipermeable membrane or in direct contact. RESULTS: The non-leukemic cells usually showed higher spontaneous VEGF release than AML cell populations. Coculture of AML blasts with HFL1 fibroblasts caused a supra-additive increase of VEGF levels when the cell populations were cultured separately, and the increase was also observed when cells were cultured in direct contact. An increase was also observed when AML blasts were cultured with osteoblastic sarcoma cells, normal bone marrow stromal cells and normal osteoblasts. Coculture had divergent effects on VEGF mRNA levels both for leukemic and non-leukemic cells, but increased mRNA levels were commonly observed especially for the non-leukemic cells. Cytokine inhibition experiments suggest that IL1 is important for the VEGF-increasing crosstalk, whereas the mechanisms are probably heterogeneous for coculture with osteoblasts. CONCLUSION: The bi-directional crosstalk via local cytokine networks between AML blasts and non-leukemic cells results in increased local VEGF levels, an observation suggesting that VEGF-targeting antiangiogenic therapy should be considered as a general therapeutic strategy in AML.",,"['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age at diagnosis of leukaemia was 48 months, and median age at vaccine titration was 84 months. The protective level of antibodies for tetanus and hepatitis B was shown in 83% and 81% of patients, respectively; the remaining 17% and 19% were not protected against the two pathogens. Double negativity was observed in only four of 62 (6%) patients in the cohort. These data were comparable with published data regarding healthy children of the same age and from the same geographical areas. Therefore, given the direct and indirect costs of performing laboratory tests, as well as the cost of revaccination, our proposal is to continue the vaccination schedule according to the child's age without any titration screening 6 months after the end of therapy.

We aimed to delineate the stage at which this type of ALL is derived in B-lineage differentiation. METHODS: The somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene and the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), recombination-activating gene 1 and 2 (RAG-1 and -2), and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) were investigated in three cell lines and two fresh samples, including a pair of matched fresh and cell line cells. RESULTS: TdT, RAG-1, and RAG-2 were variably expressed. AID was expressed in four of five samples. SHM of the IgV(H) gene was found in all samples with high average frequency (11.84%) comparable with that in follicular lymphoma. Ongoing mutation was seen in two fresh samples. CONCLUSION: As AID and SHM are generally regarded as properties exhibited by mature B cells, the presence of AID and SHM in this study seems to be incompatible with the general understanding of the early stage derivation of ALL in B-lineage differentiation. The results here give some insight into the relationship between disease type (ALL or lymphoma) and derivation stage, the overlapping of the early stage phenotype and the mature genomic characteristics, and the probable relationship between the mechanism of the occurrence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) and the machinery causing SHM.",,"['International Center for Medical Research (ICMR), Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight test substances were evaluated, two each from four classes of compounds: genotoxic carcinogens (1,2-dibromoethane and glycidol), genotoxic noncarcinogens (8-hydroxyquinoline and emodin), nongenotoxic carcinogens (methyl carbamate and o-nitrotoluene), and nongenotoxic noncarcinogens (D-mannitol and 1,2-dichlorobenzene). Quadruplicate hybridization experiments were performed in order to identify a set of genes with significant expression changes for these four classes of substances. Twelve genes were consistently altered more than twofold by the genotoxic noncarcinogens while four genes were consistently regulated by the nongenotoxic carcinogens. One gene (Trp63) was identified whose expression was upregulated by all four genotoxic substances regardless of the presence or absence of carcinogenicity; this finding, however, was not confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RT-PCR did confirm the change in expression of 9 of 15 genes (60%) identified by microarray analysis. Interestingly, the downregulated genes were least likely to be validated by real-time RT-PCR. Those genes showing more than a twofold change in expression level in response to at least one substance were further analyzed with hierarchical clustering after category assignment of each gene according to its main cellular function. Clustering revealed differences in the gene expression profiles between the genotoxic and nongenotoxic substances for genes involved in cell cycle control, the stress response, and the immune response. However, no clustering specific to all four carcinogenic substances was observed in any of the functional categories. Taken together, these results suggest that gene expression profiling in mouse lymphoma cells can provide valuable information for the evaluation of potential genotoxicity but may have limitations in predicting carcinogenicity.","['2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Korea Institute of Toxicology, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon, South Korea.']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecularly it is known to stimulate mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cytokine secretion, and cell proliferation. This study was designed to determine the influence of LLLI on the kinetics of MMP stimulation and decay, specific cytokine gene expression, and subcellular localization of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein on HaCaT human keratinocytes. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cells were irradiated by a 780 nm titanium-sapphire (Ti-Sa) laser with 2 J/cm(2) energy density. MMP was monitored with Mitotracker, a mitochondrial voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye. Cytokine gene expression was carried out using semi-quantitative-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Subcellular localization of PML protein, a cell-cycle checkpoint protein, was determined using immunofluorescent staining. RESULTS: The fluorescence intensity of MMP was increased immediately after the end of LLLI by 148 +/- 6% over control (P<0.001). Subsequently it decayed, reaching 51 +/- 14% of the control level (P < 0.01) within 200 minutes. This decay was characterized by an exponential curve (R = 0.96) with a lifetime of 79 +/- 36 minutes (P < 0.05). Following irradiation, the expression of interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-6, and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) genes were transiently upregulated; but the expression of the proinflammatory gene interleukin-1beta, was suppressed. The subnuclear distribution of PML was altered from discrete domains to its dispersed form within less than 1 hour after LLLI. CONCLUSIONS: These changes reflect a biostimulative boost that causes a shift of the cell from a quiescent to an activated stage in the cell cycle heralding proliferation and suppression of inflammation. Further characterization of MMP kinetics may provide a quantitative basis for assessment of the effect of LLLI in the clinical setting.","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of Molecular Virology, The Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel. lilach_g@md.huji.ac.il']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the identification of a SRC-like tyrosine kinase gene, FRK (Fyn-related kinase), fused with ETV6 in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia carrying t(6;12)(q21;p13). Both reciprocal fusion transcripts, ETV6/FRK and FRK/ETV6, were expressed. In ETV6/FRK, exon 4 of ETV6 was fused in-frame to exon 3 of FRK, producing a chimeric protein consisting of the entire oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the kinase domain of FRK. The ETV6/FRK protein was shown to be constitutively autophosphorylated on its tyrosine residues. ETV6/FRK phosphorylated histones H2B and H4 in vitro to a greater extent than did FRK, suggesting it had elevated kinase activity. ETV6/FRK could transform both Ba/F3 cells and NIH3T3 cells, which depended on its kinase activity. Moreover, ETV6/FRK inhibited ETV6-mediated transcriptional repression in a dominant-negative manner. This report provides the first evidence that a SRC-like kinase gene, FRK fused with ETV6, could directly contribute to leukemogenesis by producing an oncoprotein, ETV6/FRK, with dual functions: constitutive activation of the ETV6/FRK tyrosine kinase and dominant-negative modulation of ETV6-mediated transcriptional repression.",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FRK protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human blood cancers, loss of Rb expression has been widely reported in both acute myeloblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukemias, cyclin D1 amplification is common in mantle cell lymphoma, and silencing of the p16/INK4a tumor suppressor gene occurs frequently in AML and various types of lymphoma. Silencing of p16/INK4A expression is frequently caused by hyper-methylation of CpG islands in its promoter but may also be achieved through activation of Bmi-1, for example in lymphomas associated with the E2A-Pbx1 translocation. Hematopoietic homeostasis ensures a balance between proliferation and differentiation at different levels within the hematopoietic hierarchy such that hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, progenitor proliferation and terminal differentiation to functional blood cells are maintained throughout the life of the animal. Leukemic transformation disrupts this balance favoring proliferation over differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulation and checkpoint control in the hematopoietic system are not understood.

Recent work shows that the leukemia-associated fusion protein PML-RAR can mediate both biological effects targeting independent pathways, through a unifying mechanism. Differentiation block is achieved through transcriptional silencing of genes physiologically regulated by RAR, which are involved in hematopoietic differentiation. In contrast, enhanced resistance to stress is due to the capacity of the fusion protein to cause degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, thus explaining the puzzling observation that mutations of p53 are remarkably rare in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Interestingly, this latter phenomenon depends on expression of wild-type PML, acting as a molecular bridge between p53 and the fusion protein. Strikingly, both effects require a unifying molecular mechanism: aberrant recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Therefore, the study of this form of leukemia appears also of interest for a better understanding of the action of HDAC inhibitors, potential antitumor drugs that are at the early stages of clinical studies.",,"['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Via Ripamonti 435, 20141 Milan, Italy.']","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",31,20050119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess this risk more precisely, the German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group investigated the incidence of t-MDS/t-AML after ASCT on the basis of a randomized comparison of ASCT versus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) maintenance in indolent lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, 440 patients with indolent lymphoma were randomly assigned after a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone-like induction therapy regimen to myeloablative radiochemotherapy followed by ASCT or IFN-alpha. The incidence of secondary hematologic malignancies was determined by standardized follow-up of all study patients. Bone marrow samples from patients with proven or suspected t-MDS/t-AML were centrally reviewed. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 44 months, 431 patients were assessable. Five of 195 patients developed a secondary hematologic malignancy after ASCT. Two of these patients developed a secondary AML. Accordingly, the estimated 5-year risk for secondary hematologic neoplasias after ASCT was 3.8%. In contrast, in the IFN-alpha arm, the 5-year risk of hematologic neoplasias was 0.0% (P = .0248). CONCLUSION: The data of this randomized trial demonstrate an increased risk of secondary hematologic malignancies after myeloablative radiochemotherapy and ASCT compared with conventional chemotherapy. However, as ASCT significantly improves progression-free survival, it is currently not evident to what extent the higher rate of t-MDS/t-AML will diminish the benefit of ASCT in indolent lymphoma.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, University Hospital Grosshadern, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany. georg.lenz@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']","['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 1;23(25):6263-4; author reply 6264-6.

We now describe similar results with changes that reduce toxicity (fewer cycles, less vincristine, use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive newly diagnosed children with high-risk NB underwent induction that initially had seven cycles (57 patients) but was later limited to five (30 patients). Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 used cyclophosphamide (140 mg/kg)/doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2))/vincristine (0.15 mg/kg in the first 27 patients, 0.067 mg/kg subsequently). Cycles 3, 5, and 7 used cisplatin (200 mg/m(2))/etoposide (600 mg/m(2)). Tumor resection followed a minimum of three cycles. The induction was eventually modified to include anti-G(D2) immunotherapy after each of the last three cycles (38 patients). RESULTS: Bone marrow disease resolved in 70 (91%) of 77 patients and was not detected pre- and postinduction in 10 patients. After cycle 3 or 4, 86% of primary tumors were more than 50% smaller. Postinduction metaiodobenzylguanidine scans showed normal radiotracer distribution in metastatic sites in 74 (87%) of 85 patients. Overall results were: 68 (79%) complete/very good partial responses (CR/VGPR); 14 (16%) partial responses (PR); three (3%) less than PR; one (1%) death from infection; and one patient not assessable for response. Five cycles yielded a CR/VGPR rate of 83%, compared with a 77% rate from seven cycles. Side effects were myelosuppression, mucositis, and hearing deficits; neurotoxicity was insignificant with the lower vincristine dosage. Four patients (each received seven cycles) developed myelodysplasia/leukemia. CONCLUSION: Five cycles of this induction regimen, plus surgery, suffice to achieve CR/VGPR in approximately 80% of children with high-risk NB.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. kushnerb@mskcc.org']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '65988-71-8 (ganglioside, GD2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,"['CA 61017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 1;23(25):6262-3; author reply 6263.

Although several p210bcr/abl substrates have been identified, their relevance in the pathogenesis of the disease is unclear. We have identified a family of proteins, Dok (downstream of tyrosine kinase), coexpressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Members of this family such as p62dok (Dok-1) and p56dok-2 (Dok-2) associate with the p120 rasGTPase-activating protein (rasGAP) upon phosphorylation by p210bcr/abl as well as receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Here, we report the generation and characterization of single and double Dok-1 or Dok-2 knockout (KO) mutants. Single KO mice displayed normal steady-state hematopoiesis. By contrast, concomitant Dok-1 and Dok-2 inactivation resulted in aberrant hemopoiesis and Ras/MAP kinase activation. Strikingly, all Dok-1/Dok-2 double KO mutants spontaneously developed transplantable CML-like myeloproliferative disease due to increased cellular proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Furthermore, Dok-1 or Dok-2 inactivation markedly accelerated leukemia and blastic crisis onset in Tec-p210bcr/abl transgenic mice known to develop, after long latency, a myeloproliferative disorder resembling human CML.

We studied whether inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity using STI571 can relieve this differentiation block. STI571 treatment of leukemia patients induced expression of the Ig L chain-associated transcription factors IRF4 and SPIB, up-regulation of RAG1 and RAG2, Ckappa and Clambda germline transcription, and rearrangement of Ig kappa L chain (IGK) and Ig lambda L chain (IGL) genes. However, STI571-treated pre-B ALL cells expressed lambda L, but almost no kappa L chains. This could be explained by STI571-induced rearrangement of the kappa-deleting element (KDE), which can delete productively rearranged Vkappa-Jkappa joints. Amplifying double-strand breaks at recombination signal sequences within the IGK, KDE, and IGL loci revealed a coordinated sequence of rearrangement events induced by STI571: recombination of IGK gene segments was already initiated within 1 h after STI571 treatment, followed by KDE-mediated deletion of Vkappa-Jkappa joints 6 h later and, ultimately, IGL gene rearrangement after 12 h. Consistently, up-regulation of Ckappa and Clambda germline transcripts, indicating opening of IGK and IGL loci, was detected after 1 and 6 h for IGK and IGL, respectively. Continued activity of the recombination machinery induced secondary IGK gene rearrangements, which shifted preferential usage of upstream located Jkappa- to downstream Jkappa-gene segments. Thus, inhibition of BCR-ABL1 in pre-B ALL cells 1) recapitulates early B cell development, 2) directly shows that IGK, KDE, and IGL genes are rearranged in sequential order, and 3) provides a model for Ig L chain gene regulation in the human.",,"['Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Center for Biomedical Research and Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']","['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DEF6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IgK)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', '148350-00-9 (SPIB protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interplay between Ca(2+) release from internal stores and Ca(2+) entry through store-operated Ca(2+) channels has been extensively studied. Using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells and murine bone marrow-derived mast cells, we examine the role of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers. Calcium imaging experiments and patch clamp current recordings revealed both K(+)-independent and K(+)-dependent components of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Northern blot analysis indicated the predominant expression of the K(+)-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger NCKX3. Transcripts of the exchangers NCX3 and NCKX1 were additionally detected in RBL cells with RT-PCR. The Ca(2+) clearance via Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange represented approximately 50% of the total clearance when Ca(2+) signals reached levels > or =200 nM. Ca(2+) signaling and store-operated Ca(2+) entry were strongly reduced by inverting the direction of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, indicating that Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers normally extrude Ca(2+) ions from cytosol and prevent the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of store-operated Ca(2+) channels.

Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein shown to delay or block apoptosis. In this work, using semiquantitative immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and RNase protection assay, an increase in Mcl-1 expression was detected in hepatoma HepG2 cells incubated under hypoxia or in the presence of cobalt chloride. Through analysis of the Mcl-1 promoter sequence, a putative HIF-1 (hypoxiainducible factor-1) binding site was identified. A Mcl-1 promoter fragment containing this hypoxia-responsive element was able to bind HIF-1 in vitro. It also induced hypoxia-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene, which was suppressed by anti-HIF-1alpha short interfering RNA. Finally, overexpression of Mcl-1 protected HepG2 cells against apoptosis induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide as shown by inhibition of caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. All these data suggest a potential anti-apoptotic role of HIF-1 that could protect cells against apoptosis under hypoxia by overexpression of the Mcl-1 protein.",,"['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, University of Namur, 61 Rue de Bruxelles, 5000 Namur, Belgium.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)']",,20041217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 20.,"In non-excitable cells, one major route for Ca2+ influx is through store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. These channels are activated by the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and in some cell types store-operated influx occurs through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Here, we report that intracellular Ca2+ modulates CRAC channel activity through both positive and negative feedback steps in RBL-1 cells. Under conditions in which cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration can fluctuate freely, we find that store-operated Ca2+ entry is impaired either following overexpression of a dominant negative calmodulin mutant or following whole-cell dialysis with a calmodulin inhibitory peptide. The peptide had no inhibitory effect when intracellular Ca2+ was buffered strongly at low levels. Hence, Ca2+-calmodulin is not required for the activation of CRAC channels per se but is an important regulator under physiological conditions. We also find that the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase is the dominant Ca2+ efflux pathway in these cells. Although the activity of the Ca2+ pump is regulated by calmodulin, the store-operated Ca2+ entry is more sensitive to inhibition by the calmodulin mutant than by Ca2+ extrusion. Hence, these two plasmalemmal Ca2+ transport systems may differ in their sensitivities to endogenous calmodulin. Following the activation of Ca2+ entry, the rise in intracellular Ca2+ subsequently feeds back to further inhibit Ca2+ influx. This slow inactivation can be activated by a relatively brief Ca2+ influx (30-60 s); it reverses slowly and is not altered by overexpression of the calmodulin mutant. Hence, the same messenger, intracellular Ca2+, can both facilitate and inactivate Ca2+ entry through store-operated CRAC channels and through different mechanisms.",,"['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, United Kingdom.']","['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,20041220,['G0200218/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 17.,"Regulated exocytosis is a process in which a physiological trigger initiates the translocation, docking, and fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. A class of proteins termed SNAREs (including SNAP-23, syntaxins, and VAMPs) are known regulators of secretory granule/plasma membrane fusion events. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of regulated exocytosis in mast cells and find that SNAP-23 is phosphorylated when rat basophilic leukemia mast cells are triggered to degranulate. The kinetics of SNAP-23 phosphorylation mirror the kinetics of exocytosis. We have identified amino acid residues Ser(95) and Ser(120) as the major phosphorylation sites in SNAP-23 in rodent mast cells. Quantitative analysis revealed that approximately 10% of SNAP-23 was phosphorylated when mast cell degranulation was induced. These same residues were phosphorylated when mouse platelet degranulation was induced with thrombin, demonstrating that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 Ser(95) and Ser(120) is not restricted to mast cells. Although triggering exocytosis did not alter the absolute amount of SNAP-23 bound to SNAREs, after stimulation essentially all of the SNAP-23 bound to the plasma membrane SNARE syntaxin 4 and the vesicle SNARE VAMP-2 was phosphorylated. Regulated exocytosis studies revealed that overexpression of SNAP-23 phosphorylation mutants inhibited exocytosis from rat basophilic leukemia mast cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 on Ser(120) and Ser(95) modulates regulated exocytosis by mast cells.",,"['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']","['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Qa-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (R-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (SNARE Proteins)', '0 (Snap23 protein, rat)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",,20041217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: We will first briefly review current approaches to the medical treatment of ALL and brain tumors to provide an appreciation of potential sources of brain injury. We will then summarize the existing literature on types of neuropsychological deficits found among survivors, with special attention to variables that place some children at greater risk. Then, there will be a discussion of approaches to intervention for these deficits-specifically, cognitive remediation, pharmacology, and ecological alterations in the classroom.

HL-60 cells were incubated in three different sequences: (1) pre-treatment with calcitriol or its analogs and then treatment with cytostatics; (2) pre-treatment with cytostatics and then treatment with calcitriol; (3) simultaneous treatment with calcitriol and cytostatics. Apoptosis was examined either by DNA fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis or by cell-cycle analysis in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer. We showed that pre-treatment with calcitriol or one of its side-chain-modified analogs PRI-1906 or PRI-2191 caused resistance of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells to genistein-, doxorubicin-, cisplatin-, and taxol-induced apoptosis. Simultaneous exposure of HL-60 cells to calcitriol and drug caused a significant decrease in the apoptotic level of HL-60 cells compared with cells treated with drug alone. The pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with drug and then treatment with calcitriol did not increase the level of apoptosis compared with the drug effect alone.

We investigated the application of somatic gene therapy by use of a gibbon-ape-leukaemia-virus pseudotyped gammaretroviral vector. METHODS: Four children with SCID-X1 were enrolled. Autologous CD34-positive haemopoietic bone-marrow stem cells were transduced ex vivo and returned to the patients without preceding cytoreductive chemotherapy. The patients were monitored for integration and expression of the gamma(c) vector and for functional immunological recovery. FINDINGS: All patients have shown substantial improvements in clinical and immunological features, and prophylactic medication could be withdrawn in two. No serious adverse events have been recorded. T cells responded normally to mitogenic and antigenic stimuli, and the T-cell-receptor (TCR) repertoire was highly diverse.

Replication-competent murine leukemia virus (MLV) has been described to have potential as cancer therapeutics, however, MLV infection does not cause a cytopathic effect in the infected cell and viral replication can only be studied by immunostaining or measurement of reverse transcriptase activity. RESULTS: We inserted the coding sequences for green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the proline-rich region (PRR) of the ecotropic envelope protein (Env) and were able to fluorescently label MLV. This allowed us to directly monitor viral replication and attachment to target cells by flow cytometry. We used this method to study viral replication of recombinant MLVs and split viral genomes, which were generated by replacement of the MLV env gene with the red fluorescent protein (RFP) and separately cloning GFP-Env into a retroviral vector. Co-transfection of both plasmids into target cells resulted in the generation of semi-replicative vectors, and the two color labeling allowed to determine the distribution of the individual genomes in the target cells and was indicative for the occurrence of recombination events. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescently labeled MLVs are excellent tools for the study of factors that influence viral replication and can be used to optimize MLV-based replication-competent viruses or vectors for gene therapy.",,"['Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Str, 42-44, 60596 Frankfurt/Main, Germany. schba@pei.de']","['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (red fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,20041220,,,,,,PMC544597,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before a new technology can be used in a diagnostic setting, the method has to be shown to produce robust results. It is known that, given the technical aspects of specimen sampling and target preparation, global gene expression patterns can change dramatically. Various parameters such as RNA degradation, shipment time, sample purity, and patient age can principally influence measured gene expression. However, thus far, no information has been available on the robustness of a diagnostic gene expression signature. We demonstrate here that for a subset of acute leukemia, expression profiling is applicable in a diagnostic setting, considering various influencing parameters. With the use of a set of differentially expressed genes, that is, a diagnostic gene expression signature, four genetically defined acute myeloid leukemia subtypes with recurrent chromosomal aberrations can clearly be identified. In addition, we show that preparation by different operators and using different sample-handling procedures did not impair the robustness of diagnostic expression signatures. In conclusion, our results provide additional support for the applicability of microarrays in a diagnostic setting, and we have been encouraged to enroll patients in a prospective study in which microarrays will be tested as an additional routine diagnostic method in parallel with standard diagnostic procedures.",,"['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. alexander.kohlmann@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma. Our aim was to detect ERBB2-regulated target genes that contribute to its tumorigenic effect on a genomewide scale. The differential gene expression profile of ERBB2-transfected and wild-type mouse fibroblasts was monitored employing DNA microarrays. Regulated expression of selected genes was verified by RT-PCR and validated by Western blot analysis. Genome wide gene expression profiling identified (i) known targets of ERBB2 signaling, (ii) genes implicated in tumorigenesis but so far not associated with ERBB2 signaling as well as (iii) genes not yet associated with oncogenic transformation, including novel genes without functional annotation. We also found that at least a fraction of coexpressed genes are closely linked on the genome. ERBB2 overexpression suppresses the transcription of antiangiogenic factors (e.g., Sparc, Timp3, Serpinf1) but induces expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., Klf5, Tnfaip2, Sema3c). Profiling of ERBB2-dependent gene regulation revealed a compendium of potential diagnostic markers and putative therapeutic targets. Identification of coexpressed genes that colocalize in the genome may indicate gene regulatory mechanisms that require further study to evaluate functional coregulation.

The demethylating effect of 5-Aza-CdR has been well characterized. In contrast, less is known about the molecular events downstream of the methylation inhibition. Here, 5-Aza-CdR induced apoptosis in AML cells (both p53 mutant and wild-type) but not in epithelial or normal PBMCs. Cell death was accompanied by activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, as shown by release of cytochrome c and AIF and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Activation of caspase-3 (but not -6 and -8) was detectable using Western blot analysis and measurement of caspase enzymatic activity. 5-Aza-CdR treatment resulted in the induction of p21, which correlated with the arrest of AML cells in the G1 cell cycle phase. Induction of p21 expression was independent of its promoter methylation status but mediated by 5-Aza-CdR-induced reexpression of the tumor-suppressor p73, a known upstream regulator of p21. The p73 promoter was hypermethylated in AML cell lines and in primary AML cells but not in epithelial cells, which were resistant toward 5-Aza-CdR. Therefore, 5-Aza-CdR-mediated specific killing of myeloid cells might be dependent on its ability to revert p73 promoter methylation and to reexpress p73 mRNA.

Fucoidan-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and was partially prevented by pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK. The mitochondrial potential in HS-Sultan cells was decreased 24 hr after treatment with fucoidan, indicating that fucoidan induced apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway. When HS-Sultan was treated with 100 microg/mL fucoidan for 24 hr, phosphorylation of ERK and GSK markedly decreased. In contrast, phosphorylation of p38 and Akt was not altered by treatment with fucoidan. L-selectin and P-selectin are known to be receptors of fucoidan; however, as HS-Sultan does not express either of these selectins, it is unlikely that fucoidan induced apoptosis through them in HS-Sultan. The neutralizing antibody, Dreg56, against human L-selectin did not prevent the inhibitory effect of fucoidan on the proliferation of IM9 and MOLT4 cells, both of which express L-selectin; thus it is possible fucoidan induced apoptosis though different receptors.

That indicator was suggested to be a novel marker of apoptosis in L1210 cells. The aim of our present work was to reveal if these changes in glycoprotein expression can be common for apoptotic cells of different origin and for various ways of apoptosis induction. It was demonstrated that an elevated expression of plasma membrane glycoproteins rich in alpha-d-mannose and beta-d-galactose did not depend on type of cell line and its tissue origin as well as on nature of apoptosis-inducing agent. We also found that an increase in membrane glycoprotein expression was dependent on concentration of apoptosis-inducing agent and was time-dependent. Changes in glycoproteins' expression were detected as early as 9-12 hours after apoptosis induction. Two hours pretreatment of cells with non-labeled lectin decreased plasma membrane staining with corresponding peroxidase-labeled lectin, probably because of lectin-induced internalization of specific membrane glycoproteins. PSL-lectin-affinity procedure was developed for isolation of apoptotic cells from their mixed population with normal cells. Lectin-dependent agglutination analysis showed that this process occurs at much lower lectin dilutions in the apoptotic cells than in the non-apoptotic cells. Thus, we found that alpha-d-mannose- and beta-d-galactose-containing glycoproteins can be used for lectinocytochemical detection, study and isolation of apoptotic cells.",,"['Department of Regulation of Cell Proliferation, Institute of Cell Biology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Drahomanov street 14/16, Lviv 79005, Ukraine.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of cell surface death receptors, such as via TRAIL receptor ligation, may provide a novel therapeutic target for various malignancies. However, CLL and other lymphoid malignancies are resistant to TRAIL. We report that low concentrations of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as depsipeptide, which alone failed to induce apoptosis, markedly sensitize CLL cells and other primary lymphoid malignancies to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These combinations caused little or no toxicity to normal lymphocytes. HDAC inhibitors sensitized resistant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by facilitating formation of an active death-inducing signalling complex (DISC), leading to the rapid activation of caspase-8. The facilitated DISC formation also occurred in the absence of TRAIL-R2 upregulation. Thus, the combination of HDAC inhibitors and TRAIL may be valuable in the treatment of various hemopoietic malignancies.",,"['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, PO Box 138, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN, UK.']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the formation of HOCl, and this is the main microbicidal function in phagocytes. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of fludarabine on leukocytes, i.e. their degranulation capacity, MPO activity and HOCl production. METHODS: Peripheral blood leukocytes were incubated for 48 h with fludarabine. Degranulation was measured using a flow-cytometric method. MPO activity and HOCl production were measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: The degranulation capacity of fludarabine-treated leukocytes was significantly elevated compared to untreated controls. MPO activity and HOCl production were also increased in parallel. A possible direct activating effect of fludarabine was tested on the MPO activity of HL60 cells. Fludarabine did not affect MPO activity at concentrations ranging from 10 microM to 2 mM. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine had no inhibitory effect on the microbial killing of leukocytes.","['2004 S.

Epub 2004 Dec 17.,"MOTIVATION: Since DNA microarray experiments provide us with huge amount of gene expression data, they should be analyzed with statistical methods to extract the meanings of experimental results. Some dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to roughly visualize the distribution of high dimensional gene expression data. However, in the case of binary classification of gene expression data, PCA does not utilize class information when choosing axes. Thus clearly separable data in the original space may not be so in the reduced space used in PCA. RESULTS: For visualization and class prediction of gene expression data, we have developed a new SVM-based method called multidimensional SVMs, that generate multiple orthogonal axes. This method projects high dimensional data into lower dimensional space to exhibit properties of the data clearly and to visualize a distribution of the data roughly. Furthermore, the multiple axes can be used for class prediction. The basic properties of conventional SVMs are retained in our method: solutions of mathematical programming are sparse, and nonlinear classification is implemented implicitly through the use of kernel functions. The application of our method to the experimentally obtained gene expression datasets for patients' samples indicates that our algorithm is efficient and useful for visualization and class prediction.

On the other hand, the tumor suppressor function of PKR is still controversial. PKR is a serine/threonine kinase that contains two RNA-binding domains (RBD-I and RBD-II) and RBD-I is critical for its activation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that a single amino acid substitution in RBD-I is sufficient to abolish the interaction of human PKR with RNA. Also, PKR mutants that are unable to bind RNA are inactive in vitro and have no antiproliferative activity in vivo. There have been no reports of mutations in the RNA-binding domains of PKR of tumor cells taken directly from patients. We investigated the presence of mutations in the RBD-I and RBD-II of PKR gene in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The RNA extracted from bone marrow samples of 15 patients with ALL (5 patients T-lineage; 10 patients B-lineage) was used for to synthesize cDNA and amplify the sequences corresponding to RBD-I and RBD-II. The PCR products were subsequently cloned and sequenced. A point mutation was detected in the RBD-I of PKR from a patient with ALL of T-cell lineage that is located at cDNA nt 50 A --> G (17 Tyr-->Cys). We also found that activation of a PKR mutant by the polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) is impaired when compared with the wild-type PKR. Additional work is required to elucidate whether this point mutation plays a role in the formation and/or maintenance of leukemic cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first example of detection of a mutation in the RBD-I of PKR gene from tumor cells taken directly from patients.",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, School of Medicine University of Sao Paulo, 14049-900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR products were confirmed by restriction endonuclease BstX I digestion and sequencing analysis. The results showed that median levels of iASPP gene expression in cells of AL were significantly higher than those in cells from normal donors and AL patients in complete remission (CR) (P = 0.019, 0.021, respectively).

Intraclonal heterogeneity was evident in the majority of eight mutated HCLs investigated, although at a lower level compared to GC-derived lymphomas. A novel finding of preferential VH3-30 gene usage was detected (19% of HCLs). Our data confounds the postulated post-GC origin in HCL considering (1) the finding of unmutated HCLs, generally correlating with a pre-GC origin, and (2) the presence of intraclonal variation in mutated HCLs. The latter suggests that the transformed B-cell was frozen when it still had an active mutation process, implying a closer relation to the GC than previously assumed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one patients were diagnosed with PM in our institute between 1997 and 2003. Of these, 40 patients (21 male, 19 female; mean age, 53 years) also underwent MRI examination. The clinical manifestation underlying medical problems and the characteristics of MRI were analyzed. Thirty of the patients received surgical intervention or image-guided drainage/aspiration of the abscess along with administration of antibiotics, while the remaining 10 patients were promptly treated solely with antibiotics. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 40 patients had underlying medical problems. These involved diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 16), malignancies including cervical cancer, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 10, one case also had DM), autoimmune disease or asthma with long-term steroid usage (n = 4, one case also had DM), liver cirrhosis (n = 2) and chronic renal insufficiency (n = 1). Four patients had no abscess formation at presentation (invasive or early purulent stage), while the remaining 36 cases presented with at least one abscess (purulent stage). Patients older than 40 years or DM patients tended to have larger abscess(s) (P < .05). Gadolinium-enhanced images demonstrated either thick (n = 12) or thin rim enhancement (n = 24) of the abscess wall. For those 10 patients promptly treated solely with antibiotics, nine demonstrated thin rim enhancement of the abscess (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in the early recognition of bacterial PM. By precisely demarcating the extent of the disease, MRI can allow planning prompt antibiotic treatment combined with or without interventional procedures.",,"['Department of Medical Imaging, Medical College and Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, 100.']","['0 (Contrast Media)', 'K2I13DR72L (Gadolinium DTPA)']",,,,,,,"['Magn Reson Imaging. 2005 Jan;23(1):119.

Infiltrative and non-infiltrative T-acute lymphocytic leukaemic cell lines exhibited no consistent differences with respect to the expression of various chemokine receptors or beta(1)-integrins.

Numerous studies have identified the critical roles played by STAT proteins in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Consequently, the activity of STAT proteins is negatively regulated by a variety of different mechanisms, which include alternative splicing, covalent modifications, protein-protein interactions with negative regulatory proteins and proteolytic processing by proteases. Cleavage of STAT proteins by proteases results in the generation of C-terminally truncated proteins, called STATgamma, which lack the transactivation domain and behave as functional dominant-negative proteins. Currently, STATgamma isoforms have been identified for Stat3, Stat5a, Stat5b and Stat6 in different cellular contexts and biological processes. Evidence is mounting for the role of as yet unidentified serine proteases in the proteolytic processing of STAT proteins, although at least one cysteine protease, calpain is also known to cleave these STATs in platelets and mast cells. Recently, studies of acute myeloid leukaemia and cutaneous T cell lymphoma patients have revealed important roles for the aberrant expression of Stat3gamma and Stat5gamma proteins in the pathology of these diseases. Together, these findings indicate that proteolytic processing is an important mechanism in the regulation of STAT protein biological activity and provides a fertile area for future studies.",,"[""Peter Gorer Department of Immunobiology, Programme in Infection and Immunity, King's College, London, UK.""]",['0 (Transcription Factors)'],51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Periocular involvement by lymphoproliferative disease ranges from benign lymphoid hyperplasia to malignant lymphoma. Intraocular lymphomas usually appear in conjunction with primary central nervous system lymphoma. CASE REPORTS: We describe clinical characteristics, standardized A- and B-scan ultrasonography, colour Doppler, computerized tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging, and immunohistological findings in three cases of concurrent choroidal and periocular involvement of lymphoma. DISCUSSION: The clinical presentation of diffuse choroidal tumours may be variable, making diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma troublesome on clinical grounds alone. The high accuracy of colour Doppler imaging is known to be effective in differentiating the benign from the malignant and adds valuable information in the differential diagnosis of a low reflective lesion. We suggest the use of auxiliary examinations such as ultrasonography and colour Doppler imaging to help in the differential diagnosis of choroidal and orbital tumours.",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, Tel Aviv Medical Centre, Tel Aviv, Israel. meiraneu@netvision.net.il']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had noticed lymph node swelling with pain in his neck about 2 months before admission and had been treated by the transoral administration of antibiotics for about 10 days. His neck was protected with a neck collar and an evaluation of any possible neck lesion was performed. Plain X-ray film and CT scans of the cervical spine showed an anterior subluxation of the atlas and an anterior declination and erosion of the dens. The MRI findings showed long T1 and T2 values in many parts of the bone marrow of the body of the axis and the dens, and both the bone marrow and thickend soft tissue between the pharynx and the axis were slightly enhanced. Inflammatory disease, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, malignant lymphoma, and leukemia were all ruled out based on the laboratory data, Ga schintigrams and other examinations. Almost no changes in the lesion were observed on MRI at about 6 weeks after admission. As a result, we presumed that this lesion was not likely to be malignant, but might be some kind of granuloma, especially an eosinophilic granuloma. A laminectomy of the atlas and a resection of the posterior margin of the foramen magnum and upper portion of the lamina of the axis was performed to achieve decompression of the craniovertebral junction, and posterior fusion was performed with a rod betweeen the occipital bone and the C4 lamina. The rod was fixed with screws and wires to the occipital bone and with lamina hooks to the axis and C4 laminas. At 14 months postoperatively, the patient is doing well and the axis and the dens have been reconstructed without any need to resect the lesion, or perform either chemothrapy or radiotherapy. Our clinical findings of this case correlate with the opinion that an immobilization of the lesion is a sufficient treatment for many cases of eosinophilic granuloma. Although a biopsy or histological examination of the lesion was not performed, the clinical course of this case strongly suggests that this lesion was indeed an eosinophilic granuloma.",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Terakata Ikuno Hospital, Moriguchi City, Osaka, Japan.']",,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By analyzing results with unsupervised (hierarchical and K-means clustering) algorithms, three distinct immunophenotypic groups (I, II, and III) were identified, group I (51/123) with longer survivals, as compared to the group II (36/123) and III (36/123). The immunophenotypic signatures of these groups, as determined by applying the nearest Shrunken centroids method as class predictor, were characterized by the coordinated and differential expression of 12 surface markers, that is, group I: above-average expression of CD62L, CD54, CD49c, and CD25, below-average expression of CD38; group II: above-average expression of CD38, CD49d, CD29, and CD49e; and group III: below-average expression of the above markers, overexpression of CD23, CD20, SmIg, and CD79b. As opposed to groups II-III, group I B-CLLs lacked expression of ZAP-70 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase in the majority of cases, while more frequently had mutated IgV(H) genes and IgV(H) mutations consistent with antigen-driven selection.

The ligand of Axl, Gas6, is a 75 KDa multimodular protein with an N-terminal gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid that is essential for binding. Gas6 has a mitogenic effect on several normal cell lines. The receptor Axl is expressed in primary prostate carcinoma and in prostate cancer cell lines as such as PC-3 and DU 145. We demonstrated a mitogenic activity determined by Gas6/Axl interaction in these undifferentiated metastatic human prostatic cancer cell lines. This effect is proportional to Axl expression, not due to inhibition of apoptosis, and induces AKT and MAPK phosphorylation. However, only MEK phosphorylation seems to be essential for growth signaling. Our results suggest that Axl overexpression and activation by Gas6 could be involved in progression of prostate neoplastic disease.","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Universita del Piemonte Orientale ""A.

Modifying the virus with a bispecific fusion protein allowed virus receptor-independent tumor cell binding and gene transfer. The targeting molecule (alpha)HN-IL-2 contains an scFv antibody cloned from a neutralizing hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN)-specific hybridoma linked to the human cytokine IL-2. A recombinant NDV expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (NDFL-EGFP) was applied to show the expression of foreign genes in virus-infected tumor cells. At 24 hours after infection with the modified virus (NDFL-EGFP/(alpha)HN-IL-2), FACS analysis and fluorescence microscopy revealed neutralization of natural infection in IL-2 receptor-negative Jurkat leukemia cells, but targeted expression of EGFP in IL-2 receptor-positive human leukemia-derived MT-2 cells. The targeted gene delivery of NDFL-EGFP/(alpha)HN-IL-2 in MT-2 cells was blocked by the target ligand human IL-2. Selective virus entry to IL-2 receptor bearing tumor cells was also observed in a mixture of Jurkat and MT-2 cell lines. These results demonstrate that a recombinant NDV carrying a foreign gene can be successfully targeted to a specific tumor through a bispecific protein, which thereby increases the selectivity of gene transfer.",,"['Division of Cellular Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, D010, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']","['0 (5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (HN Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Succinimides)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Gene expression profiling studies in AML have shown that known and novel classes of disease can be recognized by unsupervised analyses. Prognostically informative molecular signatures can be deduced. Supervised analyses show that particular clinically relevant subsets of AML can be predicted with high accuracy with minimal sets of genes. SUMMARY: The AML GEP studies published to date show a remarkable level of concordance in findings, especially for similar GEP platforms. This confirms the robustness of the methodology and the promise for future applicability of GEP in clinical diagnostics. For the time being, certain technical hurdles remain to be overcome. These relate, for instance, to the conversion of data between different GEP platforms, the effect of differences between various statistical clustering methods, and the still incomplete understanding of the effect of biologic (eg, morphology) and genetic factors on the expression signature. GEP analyses, perhaps in combination with high-throughput mutation analysis and proteomic approaches, may ultimately result in the establishment of a comprehensive diagnostic approach that will yield a key to the precise pathobiologic nature of AML.",,"['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article critically reviews the recent literature that addresses the molecular heterogeneity of this group of patients and how this relates to prognostic stratification and novel therapeutic approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Four prognostic biomarkers-the internal tandem duplication and point mutations in the FLT3 gene, partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, mutations of the CEBPA gene, and overexpression of the BAALC gene-have been found to predict outcome in patients with AML and normal cytogenetics. In addition, one study using gene expression profiling identified two subgroups of AML patients with a normal karyotype whose survival differs significantly. Because mutations in FLT3 result in an autophosphorylated, leukemogenesis-driving protein, molecular targeting therapy with a new class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is being explored in early clinical trials.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several agents have been tested in phase 2 trials, with only modest clinical results thus far. Careful correlative studies have allowed a clearer understanding of the reasons for the success or failure of these agents and have refined our approach to clinical trial design. In some cases, the target molecule has been successfully inhibited, but for an inadequate duration, and in other cases, inhibiting the target has little correlation with clinical effect. SUMMARY: Small-molecule inhibitors of these molecular pathways clearly have significant promise for the treatment of AML, but several obstacles remain, and this field of pharmacotherapy is still quite new.

The regimens rely largely on graft-versus-leukemia effects rather than high-dose therapy to eliminate malignant cells. Studies have demonstrated that the regimens allow sustained engraftment with relatively low transplant-related mortality. However, conclusions regarding the ultimate efficacy of these regimens for myeloid malignancies have been limited, given the small numbers of patients who have had transplants so far. This review summarizes recent studies of nonablative or reduced-intensity regimens for patients with myeloid malignancies (acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and myeloproliferative disorders). In addition, this review evaluates what is currently known regarding the association of graft-versus-leukemia responses and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). When possible, graft-versus-leukemia responses are highlighted in the articles discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: This review covers six articles and four abstracts that have been published since September 2003 on patients with myeloid malignancies who received HCT following nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning. Due to the heterogeneity of the conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens, direct comparisons between studies are difficult. However, these studies have demonstrated encouraging overall survivals (30 to 74%), disease-free/event-free or progression-free survivals (19 to 62%), and nonrelapse mortalities (15 to 55%). In addition, these studies demonstrated evidence for graft-versus-leukemia responses. However, relapse and progressive disease continued to be problems, particularly in patients with large tumor burdens at time of HCT. SUMMARY: Over the past 10 years, significant advances have been made in the field of transplantation. Nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity HCT have promised patients with hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies potential cures. However, disease relapse and nonrelapse mortality, mainly from GVHD and its therapy, continue to be problems. Future studies are needed to increase our understanding of GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia responses, which will greatly improve outcome. In addition, a better understanding of minor histocompatibility antigens may lead to more targeted immunotherapy and enhance the precision and success of transplantation.",,"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. lburroug@fhcrc.org']",,65,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076930/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reduction is seen first as restoration of Ph negativity in blood and marrow and thereafter as decreasing BCR-ABL transcript levels assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML who receive imatinib achieve complete cytogenetic remission (CCYR) and low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts, a status that seems to predict for relatively long survival compared with previous treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients treated with 400 mg daily who achieved a reduction in BCR-ABL transcript numbers equal or greater than 3 logs compared with a baseline value have a significantly better progression-free survival than those who achieved lesser degrees of response. The presence of Ph-positive subclones with point mutations in the ABL kinase domain correlates with ""acquired"" resistance to imatinib and some mutations are associated with greater resistance than others. Preliminary evidence suggests that P-loop mutations are especially likely to be associated with progression to advanced-phase disease. SUMMARY: Patients with CML should be monitored routinely by serial cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow until Ph negativity is achieved. Thereafter serial quantitative-PCR studies should be undertaken at approximately 3-month intervals and probably also bone marrow cytogenetic studies at longer intervals.

This article reviews recent efforts to disrupt FLT3 signaling in acute myelogenous leukemia and to identify potential therapeutic challenges posed by the acquisition of resistance mutations in these malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Several broad classes of FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. Although the agents are well tolerated by patients, clinical responses in relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are limited and transient. Nevertheless, these agents may hold promise when combined with traditional chemotherapy. Use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for AML therapy is hindered by the acquisition of mutations in the kinase catalytic domain, and in the case of BCR-ABL, these mutations confer resistance to imatinib. In anticipation of this problem, FLT3 mutations that might confer resistance to kinase inhibitors in the clinical setting have already been identified in the laboratory. Strategies to overcome such resistance are currently under development. New efforts focus on blocking the binding of FLT3 ligand to its receptor as a means of inhibiting autocrine stimulation in leukemogenesis. SUMMARY: FLT3 is widely expressed in AML and some cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Activating mutations in FLT3 confer a poor risk in patients with AML. The development of FLT3 small molecule kinase inhibitors follows from research efforts to understand signal transduction and profiles of gene expression in leukemia pathogenesis. Thus, FLT3 is a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Research priorities will include (1) identification of other groups of patients likely to benefit from FLT3 inhibition, (2) the optimal use of FLT3 inhibitors in combination with other agents, and (3) development of molecules that overcome resistance to FLT3 inhibitors that arise as a result of further acquired mutations in the receptor.",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",69,,"['K08 CA82261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reviews recent findings that reveal why a traditional poison has become a magical potion for a major type of APL, which is characterized by a balanced chromosomal translocation t(15;17). RECENT FINDINGS: Daily IV infusion of arsenic trioxide (As2O3; ATO) for 30 to 40 days can lead to complete remission in about 85% of patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed APL. Oral preparations of ATO and tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As4S4) seem to be as effective as parenteral ATO, with similar toxicity profiles. The combination of all-trans retinoic acid and ATO in patients with newly diagnosed APL has yielded more durable remission than monotherapy. The mechanism of arsenic cytotoxicity is thought to involve posttranslational modification followed by degradation of the PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein; targeting of PML to nuclear bodies with restoration of its physiologic functions; and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase in leukemic cells or collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The understanding of arsenic cytotoxicity has stimulated modifications that promise to improve efficacy, such as interfering with ROS scavenging or boosting of ROS production to enhance the cytotoxicity, and adding cAMP or interferons to ATO regimens.

This review focuses on the risk factors and pathologies of patients at risk for hyperuricemic complications. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from MEDLINE (PubMed) and published abstracts of meeting presentations. RESULTS: Both host-related and tumor-related factors predispose cancer patients to hyperuricemic syndromes. Host-related factors include low urinary flow, pre-existing hyperuricemia, renal failure, dehydration, acidic urine, and suppressed renal uric acid excretion. Tumor-related risk factors include a high tumor cell proliferation rate, large tumor burden, and tumor chemosensitivity. Acute renal failure may occur after cytoreductive chemotherapy in patients with active disease and a high tumor burden. Patients with advanced Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma, high-grade lymphoma, or acute leukemia with elevated leukocyte counts are at high risk for complications of hyperuricemia. The use of nonrecombinant (uricozyme) or recombinant urate oxidase to prevent or treat urate nephropathy may improve the outcome of patients. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of metabolic abnormalities in cancer patients at risk for hyperuricemia is essential for proper therapy.

In 15 patients (13 low risk and 2 intermediate risk), circulating Vdelta1 T lymphocytes were significantly increased (100 to 300 cells/muL) compared with most intermediate, all high-risk stage, and 15 healthy donors (50 to 100 cells/muL). We studied these Vdelta1 T lymphocytes and observed that they proliferated in vitro and produced tumor necrosis factor alpha or IFN-gamma in response to autologous leukemic B cells but not to normal lymphocytes. However, they were unable to kill resting autologous B cells, which lack the MHC-related MIC-A antigen and express low levels of the UL16-binding protein (ULBP) 3 and undetectable levels of ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP4. All these molecules are reported ligands for the NKG2D receptor, which is expressed by gammadelta T cells and activates their cytolytic function. The Vdelta1 T lymphocytes studied were able to lyse the ULBP3(+) C1R B-cell line upon transfection with MIC-A. More importantly, they also lysed autologous B-CLL cells when transcription and expression of MIC-A or up-regulation of ULBP3 were achieved either by activation or by exposure to trans-retinoic acid. The NKG2D receptor expressed on Vdelta1 T cells was involved in the recognition of B-CLL. Finally, in six patients with low numbers of circulating Vdelta1 T cells and undetectable ULBP3, the disease progressed over 1 year, whereas no progression occurred in patients with high Vdelta1 T lymphocytes and detectable/inducible ULBP3.

Some of the molecular events that occur during the development of endometrial carcinoma have been characterized, showing a dualistic genetic model for EEC and NEEC. However, the molecular bases for endometrial tumorigenesis are not clearly elucidated. In the present work, we attempted to identify new genes that could trigger cell transformation in EEC. We analyzed the differential gene expression profile between tumoral and nontumoral endometrial specimens with cDNA array hybridization. Among the 53 genes for which expression was found to be altered in EEC, the acute myeloid leukemia proto-oncogene, RUNX1/AML1, was one of the most highly up-regulated. The gene expression levels of RUNX1/AML1 were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR, and protein levels were characterized by tissue array immunohistochemistry. Real-time quantitative PCR validated RUNX1/AML1 up-regulation in EEC and demonstrated a specific and significantly stronger up-regulation in those tumor stages associated with myometrial invasion. Furthermore, tissue array immunohistochemistry showed that RUNX1/AML1 up-regulation correlates to the process of tumorigenesis, from normal atrophic endometrium to simple and complex hyperplasia and then, on to carcinoma.

In many of these pathways, Shp2 acts upstream of Ras. About 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome have germ-line PTPN11 gain of function mutations. Associations between Noonan syndrome and an increased risk of some malignancies, notably leukemia and neuroblastoma, have been reported, and recent data indicate that somatic PTPN11 mutations occur in children with sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplasic syndrome, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia patients without PTPN11 mutations have either homozygotic NF-1 deletion or activating RAS mutations. Given the role of Shp2 in Ras activation and the frequent mutation of RAS in human tumors, these data raise the possibility that PTPN11 mutations play a broader role in cancer. We asked whether PTPN11 mutations occur in other malignancies in which activating RAS mutations occur at low but significant frequency. Sequencing of PTPN11 from 13 different human neoplasms including breast, lung, gastric, and neuroblastoma tumors and adult AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed 11 missense mutations. Five are known mutations predicted to result in an activated form of Shp2, whereas six are new mutations. Biochemical analysis confirmed that several of the new mutations result in increased Shp2 activity. Our data demonstrate that mutations in PTPN11 occur at low frequency in several human cancers, especially neuroblastoma and AML, and suggest that Shp2 may be a novel target for antineoplastic therapy.",,"['Cancer Biology Program, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. mbentire@bidmc.harvard.edu']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,"['CA43460/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA49152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 16.,"Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity initiates a number of intracellular signaling cascades that result in leukemogenesis. Imatinib mesylate, a specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been highly successful in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, the emergence of imatinib resistance and the incomplete molecular response of a significant number of patients receiving this therapy have led to a search for combinations of drugs that will enhance the efficacy of imatinib. We have demonstrated that mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor that results in depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotides, is synergistic with imatinib in inducing apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines. Studies of signaling pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl demonstrated that the addition of MPA to imatinib reduced the phosphorylation of both Stat5 and Lyn, a Src kinase family member. The phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein was also greatly reduced. These results demonstrate that inhibitors of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis may synergize with imatinib in reducing the levels of minimal residual disease in CML and lay the foundation for clinical trials in which IMPDH inhibitors are added to imatinib in patients who have suboptimal molecular responses to single agent therapy or who have progressive disease.",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7295, USA.']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",,20041216,['CA 64193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexes were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at liquid nitrogen temperature. Primary solid tumors and secondary solid tumors or ascites were inoculated on the same day, or with a delay. The primary tumor inhibited growth of the secondary solid tumor only if the latter was inoculated with a delay, which did not correlate with the change of the types, nor with the increase in the level of Fe-NO complexes detected in the tissue, suggesting a ""non-immunological"" character of this inhibition. In some animals with solid tumors, spontaneous ascites developed. This process resulted in a marked decrease in the level of Fe-NO complexes in the solid tumor tissue. The primary solid tumor, however, did not influence the growth of secondary ascites, but intensified NO generation in the ascites of animals with partial removal of ascitic fluid. This experimental group survived 2.2 days longer than the control group without primary solid tumor. Our research revealed that the presence of Fe-NO complexes in the interaction between primary and secondary tumor strongly depends on the form of the tumor: solid or ascitic, and that murine L5178Y lymphoma may serve as a convenient model for the research on ""concomitant immunity"" against in vivo growing tumors.

Alternative donors, such as HLA mismatched family donors, are associated with higher rates of graft rejection and acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) if T cells are not first depleted. We developed a new technique for HLA mismatched allogeneic HSCT using G-CSF primed bone marrow plus G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells without ex vivo T cell depletion. METHODS: In this study, 58 patients, including 33 with high-risk or advanced leukemia, were transplanted with cells from an HLA-haploidentical family donor with 1 - 3 mismatched loci. After conditioning, patients received G-CSF-primed bone marrow grafts that had not been depleted ex vivo of T cells, in combination with G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, as well as GVHD prophylaxis. RESULT: All patients achieved sustained, full donor-type engraftment. The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 37.9%, including 3 patients with grade III-IV aGVHD. The development of aGVHD was not associated with the extent of HLA disparity. Chronic GVHD was observed in 30 of 51 evaluable patients (65.4%). Fourteen patients died among whom 7 died of recurrent disease and 7 of transplant-related complications. Forty-four of the 58 patients survived, and 42 remained disease free at the time of a median follow-up of 12 months (3.5 to 39.5 months). The 2-year probabilities of disease-free survival were 74.8% and 69.3% for standard- and high-risk patients, respectively.

Mixture model method (MMM hereafter) is a nonparametric statistical method often used for microarray processing applications, but is known to over-fit the data if the number of replicates is small. In addition, the results of the MMM may not be repeatable when dealing with a small number of replicates. In this paper, we propose a new version of MMM to ensure the repeatability of the results in different runs, and reduce the sensitivity of the results on the parameters. RESULTS: The proposed technique is applied to the two different data sets: Leukaemia data set and a data set that examines the effects of low phosphate diet on regular and Hyp mice. In each study, the proposed algorithm successfully selects genes closely related to the disease state that are verified by biological information. CONCLUSION: The results indicate 100% repeatability in all runs, and exhibit very little sensitivity on the choice of parameters. In addition, the evaluation of the applied method on the Leukaemia data set shows 12% improvement compared to the MMM in detecting the biologically-identified 50 expressed genes by Thomas et al.

This review provides a summary of in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies of T-cells by BCX-1777, and the role in this process of plasma deoxyguanosine (dGuo) and intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). Preliminary data from a phase I clinical trial of BCX-1777 in patients with T-cell malignancy demonstrated antileukemic activity which can be correlated to an increase in plasma dGuo and intracellular dGTP. This is consistent with results observed in cell cultures, animal studies and PNP-deficient patients. Clinical trials with BCX-1777 have demonstrated that inhibition of PNP leads to T-cell-selective suppression, confirming PNP to be a promising target for the treatment of T-cell-mediated diseases.",,"['BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc, Birmingham, AL 35244, USA. sbantia@biocryst.com']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Spleen cells were isolated from the mice irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays. Primary cultured cells from mice were incubated in different intervals after X-irradiation at different dosages. Total RNA was extracted from the cells and the fluctuation of JunB mRNA level was assessed by the RNA ratio of JunB/beta-actin measured by quantitative Northern blot hybridization. RESULTS: After the mice were exposed to 3 Gy X-rays irradiation, JunB expression in spleen cells was remarkably and rapidly increased, and reached its peak 0.5 h later in C3H/He mice and 1 h later in Balb/c mice. In the primary culture of normal spleen and leukemia cells, JunB mRNA levels increased 30 min after irradiation. The enhanced levels of JunB mRNA were returned to a normal level within 240 min after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: JunB gene is responsive to ionizing irradiation and is induced at immediate-early phase after the stimulation.

To characterize its potential therapeutic value, we analyzed different modes to activate RNAi as well as some pharmacokinetic aspects of gene silencing in bcr-abl+ cells. Using lentiviral gene transfer of transcription cassettes for anti-bcr-abl shRNAs and red fluorescence protein (RFP) as a quantitative reporter, we demonstrate that stable but not transient RNAi can efficiently deplete bcr-abl+ K562 and murine TonB cells from suspension cultures. Importantly, depletion of bcr-abl+ cells depends on the dose of lentivirus used for transduction and correlates with the RFP-expression level of transduced target cells: RFP-high K562 cells are eradicated, whereas RFP-low or -intermediate cells may recover after prolonged cell culture. Interestingly, these cells still show reduced bcr-abl mRNA levels, aberrant proliferation kinetics, and enhanced sensitivity to the Bcr-Abl-kinase inhibitor STI571. Quantitative PCR from genomic DNA suggests that more than three lentiviral integrations are required for effective depletion of K562 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that lentivirus-mediated anti-bcr-abl RNAi can inhibit colony formation of primary CD34+ cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients. These data demonstrate dose-dependent gene silencing by lentivirus-mediated RNAi in bcr-abl+ cells and suggest that stable RNAi may indeed be therapeutically useful in primary hematopoietic cells.",,"['Department Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']","['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (red fluorescent protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several observations have suggested that early myeloid cells are uniquely susceptible to transformation by PML-RARalpha. Recently, we have shown that the early myeloid-specific protease neutrophil elastase is important for APL development in the mouse. To better understand the role of neutrophil elastase for the pathogenesis of APL, we examined the consequences of PML-RARalpha expression in early myeloid cells with or without neutrophil elastase. We found that high-level PML-RARalpha expression was associated with cellular toxicity that was dependent on the expression of neutrophil elastase; a mutant form of PML-RARalpha that resisted neutrophil elastase cleavage was not toxic. When PML-RARalpha was expressed at very low levels in the early myeloid cells of mice, it induced myeloid expansion and delayed myeloid maturation; neutrophil elastase was also required for these activities. The activities of PML-RARalpha in early myeloid cells are therefore strongly influenced by the presence of neutrophil elastase. To assure physiologic relevance, PML-RARalpha functions should be evaluated in neutrophil elastase-expressing early myeloid cells.",,"['Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, 660 S.

Epub 2004 Dec 15.,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is deregulated in many human cancers, and its overexpression in cells leads to malignant transformation. Oncogenic properties of eIF4E are directly linked to its ability to bind 7-methyl guanosine of the 5' mRNA. Here, we observe that the antiviral guanosine analogue ribavirin binds to eIF4E with micromolar affinity at the functional site used by 7-methyl guanosine mRNA cap, competes with eIF4E:mRNA binding, and, at low micromolar concentrations, selectively disrupts eIF4E subcellular organization and transport and translation of mRNAs posttranscriptionally regulated by eIF4E, thereby reducing levels of oncogenes such as cyclin D1. Ribavirin potently suppresses eIF4E-mediated oncogenic transformation of murine cells in vitro, of tumor growth of a mouse model of eIF4E-dependent human squamous cell carcinoma in vivo, and of colony formation of eIF4E-dependent acute myelogenous leukemia cells derived from human patients.

This study was to evaluate efficacy of imatinib mesylate, a specific inhibitor of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase, on CML in blast phase. METHODS: Nineteen patients with CML in blast phase (imatinib treatment group) received induction of cytarabine-based standard chemotherapy for 2 cycles, and 400 mg/d of imatinib mesylate for 4 weeks. Patients with no remission received 600 mg/d of imatinib mesylate for another 8 weeks. Treatment of 600 mg/d of imatinib mesylate was maintained if it showed effects after 8 weeks, otherwise it would be stopped. Twenty-two patients with CML in blast phase (historical control group) received inducement of cytarabine-based chemotherapy for 2 cycles, and other regimens of consolidation or continuous induction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients of imatinib treatment group achieved no hematologic remission after induction. After treated with imatinib mesylate, 6 of 16 (38%) achieved hematologic complete remission (CHR), and major cytogenetic response; 2 of 16(13%) achieved hematologic partial remission (PHR); 1 of 16 (6%) returned to chronic phase with minor cytogenetic response. Total hematologic response rate of imatinib treatment group was 57%; 1-year survival rate was 38% (6/16). Eighteen patients of historical control group achieved no hematologic remission after inducement. After treated with other regimens, 2 (11%) achieved CHR, and 1 (6%) achieved PHR. Total hematologic response rate of historical control group was 17%; 1-year survival rate was 6%(1/18), significantly lower than that of imatinib treatment group (P< 0.05).

BFM-90 regimen for lymphoblastic lymphoma is one of the most effective regimens. This study was designed to evaluate efficacy and toxicities of modified BFM-90 regimen on Chinese children and adolescents with lymphoblastic lymphoma. METHODS: A total of 20 naive children and adolescents with T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma were enrolled, 7 in stage III, and 13 in stage IV. Eighteen (90%) patients suffered from mediastinal mass with superior vena obstruction syndrome,10(50%) suffered from marrow invasion. All patients received modified BFM-90 regimen consisting of induction, consolidation and central nervous system prophylaxis, reinduced alleviation, and maintenance therapy. Total treatment duration was 2 years. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate long-term survival rate. RESULTS: After induction remission,18 patients (90%) achieved complete remission (CR), 1 had partial remission (PR), and 1 had progressive disease (PD), overall response rate was 95%. The 2 patients with PR or PD died of tumor progression. Of 2 patients at CR1 received APBSC, 1 relapsed after transplantation, but achieved CR and survived after salvage chemotherapy;1 survived all along. Of other patients achieved CR, 5 relapsed; of these 5 patients, 1 survived after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 1 survived after autologous stem cell transplantation, 3 died of progressive disease after chemotherapy. The overall 3-year survival rate was 74%. All patients had myelosuppression of grade III-IV during the induction and reinduction phases, but the hemotologic toxicity was manageable.

It is necessary to search for the molecular mechanism underlying anti-apoptosis of MDR cells. However, because of the anti-apoptosis characteristic of MDR cells, it is hard to study the mechanism on their apoptosis pathway. This study was to induce apoptosis in human acute leukemia cell line HL-60, and its MDR cell lines HR20 and HT9 by cyclosporin A (CsA), analyze the differences in apoptosis pathway between MDR cells and sensitive cells by detecting several important apoptosis-related molecules. METHODS: HL-60, HR20, and HT9 cells were treated with 10, and 20 mg/L of CsA, cell apoptosis was identified by cell morphologic changes,electrophoresis,and flow cytometry. Changes of apoptosis-related factors were detected by spectrophotometer and Western blot. RESULTS: HL-60, HR20, and HT9 cells all showed obvious apoptotic characteristics after treated with CsA,such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) degradation and activation, and DNA fragmentation. However, Caspase-3 activation was only detected in apoptotic HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: CsA may induce apoptosis of HR20, and HT9 cells in a Caspase-3 independent manner, which is different from apoptosis of sensitive cells. In the apoptosis pathway of HR20, and HT9 cells, there may be some factors other than Caspase-3 that can activate DFF. It is postulated that the difficulty of Caspase-3 to be activated may be an important reason for HR20 and HT9 cells to resist apoptosis induced by many chemotherapeutic drugs.",,"[""Gynecological Oncology Center, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, P.R.

The survival rates of the Ph+ chromosome cells in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) and the K562 cells were determined by the conventional chromosome assays, after About 3 x 10(5)/ml DC incubating with autologous T cells activated by IL-2 or DCs plus IL-2 for 6 hours. RESULTS: About 3 x 10(5)/ml DC per 2 x 10(6)/ml PBMNC were produced. The cytotoxic effect of the T cells activated by DCs plus IL-2 on the autologous Ph+ chromosome cells was significantly greater than those activated by IL-2 (P < 0.001). The clearance activity of the DC activated T cells on the autologous CML Ph+ chromosome cells was stronger than on the K562 cells (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The DCs-activated autologous T cells can effectively inhibit the Ph+ chromosome cells. The cytotoxic effect of the autologous T cells activated by the DCs on the Ph+ chromosome cells could be MHC-restricted.",,"['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Bone marrow recurrences were isolated in 79 patients, and combined with an extramedullary site in 27 patients. The median time to recurrence was 2.6 years (range, 0.3-11.6 years). Seventy-six patients (71.7%) attained a second remission (median length, 0.7 year; range, 0.03-13.3 years). The 5-year survival probability among all patients was 24.2% +/- 4.2% (standard error).

The purpose of this study was to assess the toxicity, safety and efficacy of low-dose recombinant IL-11 in patients with bone marrow failure (BMF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with BMF due to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), graft failure, chemotherapy or aplastic anemia (AA) were treated. Patients were required to have a platelet count of <20 x 10(9)/l, or a platelet count of <50 x 10(9)/l with an absolute neutrophil count <1 x 10(9)/l, or a hemoglobin value <10 g/dl. Treatment consisted of daily IL-11 at a dose of 10 mug/kg subcutaneously followed by a 2-week rest period. Two induction courses were given. Responders could receive maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (MDS, n=14; AA, n=16; prolonged thrombocytopenia following stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy, n=3) were evaluable. Their median age was 58 years (range 5-85). Three patients (9%) had poor risk cytogenetics. Nine patients (27%) responded to IL-11 (six MDS, three AA). Of these, three patients treated with IL-11 alone (n=1) or IL-11 together with other growth factors (n=2) showed multilineage recovery. The median time to response was 0.9 months (range 0.3-11). Factors associated with higher response rates in univariate analysis were age >50 years (P=0.008), diagnosis of MDS versus AA (P=0.025) and creatinine level >1 mg/dl (P=0.0004). The median response duration was 3 months (range 1.4-34.5+). Amongst responders, the median increment in platelet count was 111 x 10(9)/l (range 43-165). The most common side-effects were grade 1-2 lower extremity edema, conjunctival injections and fatigue. Grade 3 toxicities included arrhythmia (n=1) and transient ischemic attack (n=1).

Epub 2004 Dec 14.,"MOTIVATION: One problem with discriminant analysis of DNA microarray data is that each sample is represented by quite a large number of genes, and many of them are irrelevant, insignificant or redundant to the discriminant problem at hand. Methods for selecting important genes are, therefore, of much significance in microarray data analysis. In the present study, a new criterion, called LS Bound measure, is proposed to address the gene selection problem. The LS Bound measure is derived from leave-one-out procedure of LS-SVMs (least squares support vector machines), and as the upper bound for leave-one-out classification results it reflects to some extent the generalization performance of gene subsets. RESULTS: We applied this LS Bound measure for gene selection on two benchmark microarray datasets: colon cancer and leukemia. We also compared the LS Bound measure with other evaluation criteria, including the well-known Fisher's ratio and Mahalanobis class separability measure, and other published gene selection algorithms, including Weighting factor and SVM Recursive Feature Elimination. The strength of the LS Bound measure is that it provides gene subsets leading to more accurate classification results than the filter method while its computational complexity is at the level of the filter method.

One hundred thirteen (69%) centers performed HLA-identical sibling transplantations, whereas 162 (99%) performed autologous transplantations. Factors associated with decreased 100-day mortality in the allogeneic setting include a higher patient-per-physician ratio (P = .003) and centers where physicians answer calls after office hours (P = .03). Medical school affiliation was not associated with increased 100-day mortality except in centers where students/residents are present without fellows (P = .02). Center effects were weaker in autologous HSCT at 1 year. Differences in 100-day mortality in patients receiving transplants in centers with favorable versus unfavorable factors were greater in allogeneic than autologous HSCT.

In order to study this relationship in a direct manner, we expressed the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T) recombinase under the control of the stem cell leukemia (Scl) stem-cell enhancer in transgenic mice (HSC-SCL-Cre-ER(T)). To determine functionality, HSC-SCL-Cre-ER(T) transgenics were bred with Cre reporter mice. Flow cytometric and transplantation studies revealed tamoxifen-dependent recombination occurring in more than 90% of adult long-term HSCs, whereas the targeted proportion within mature progenitor populations was significantly lower. Moreover, the transgene was able to irreversibly tag embryonic HSCs on days 10 and 11 of gestation. These cells contributed to bone marrow hematopoiesis 5 months later. In order to investigate whether the de novo HSC generation is completed during embryogenesis, HSC-SCL-Cre-ER(T)-marked fetal liver cells were transplanted into adult recipients. Strikingly, the proportion of marked cells within the transplanted and the in vivo-remaining HSC compartment was not different, implying that no further HSC generation occurred during late fetal and neonatal stages of development.

Reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, a donor for methylating dUMP to dTMP in DNA synthesis, to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the primary methyl donor for methionine synthesis, is catalyzed by 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The MTHFR polymorphisms C677T and A1298C have been shown in some studies to alter the risk of a range of different malignancies. We evaluated the role of the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk by genotyping 832 patients and 886 healthy controls. The odds ratio of CLL associated with 677CT and 677TT genotypes were 1.02 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.83-1.24] and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.66-1.24), respectively.

Here, we explore the feasibility and efficiency of protein identification using the one-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with the nano liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). The use of only 40 mug of purified mitochondrial proteins and data analysis using stringent scoring criteria and the molecular mass validation of the gel slices enables the identification of 227 known mitochondrial proteins (membrane and soluble) and 453 additional proteins likely to be associated with mitochondria. Replicate analyses of 60 mug of mitochondrial proteins on the faster scanning LTQ mass spectrometer validate all the previously identified proteins and most of the single hit proteins except the 81 single hit proteins. Among the identified proteins, 466 proteins are known to functionally participate in various processes such as respiration, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, glycolysis, protection against oxidative stress, mitochondrial assembly, molecular transport, protein biosynthesis, cell cycle control, and many known cellular processes. The distribution of identified proteins in terms of size, pI, and hydrophobicity reveal that the present analytical strategy is largely unbiased and very efficient.

The aim of the study was therefore to present an analytical method for the concomitant determination of several CH in human tumor cell lines, to generate expressional patterns in the individual cell lines and to search for tumor and non-tumor cell line specific CH expression.Human tumor cell lines of neuroblastoma, colorectal and adenocarcinoma of the ovary, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma, lung, cervical and breast cancer, promyelocytic leukaemia were homogenised, proteins were separated on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with in-gel digestion of proteins and MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis was carried out for the identification of CH. RESULTS: A series of CH was identified including the main CH groups as HSP90/HATPas_C, HSP70, Cpn60_TCP1, DnaJ, Thioredoxin, TPR, Pro_isomerase, HSP20, ERP29_C, KE2, Prefoldin, DUF704, BAG, GrpE and DcpS. CONCLUSIONS: The ten individual tumor cell lines showed different expression patterns, which are important for the design of CH studies in tumor cell lines. The results can serve as a reference map and form the basis of a concomitant determination of CH by a protein chemical rather than an immunochemical method, independent of antibody availability or specificity.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. gert.lubec@meduniwien.ac.at.']",,,20041214,,,,,,PMC543454,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present article seeks to make a contribution by placing psychosocial aspects of childhood AML on the agenda. The findings are from a 5-year longitudinal, qualitative study on the psychosocial aspects of paediatric leukaemia. Qualitative data is gathered from open-ended interviews at three points in time on the experience of illness. The holistic findings from T1 present the impact of diagnosis and early treatment for childhood AML from the perspective of mothers, father, sibling and child patients. The study is also following up families with related disorders, thus it is possible to assess difference to other haematological groups. The findings indicate that the families bring scant prior understanding of the illness, and experience the diagnosis with fear and seriousness as a confrontation with death. At the point of entering treatment they are in a profound sense of shock and grief, which is exacerbated by a distressing, all pervading, sense of uncertainty. Families can be overwhelmed by the exhaustion of attending to the escalating practical demands of the situation combined with fatigue, worry and poor nutrition. All families find dealing with the invasive procedures and aggressive drug protocols emotionally challenging. However, in spite of the difficulties, parents have a strong desire to be with their child and find any separation painful. Families come to view the ward as a comfort zone where they have the support of the health and allied health team and the camaraderie of others experiencing a similar situation. However, even this support has to be qualified by the need for personal space, the difficulty of handling complex emotions, and the fear of being overwhelmed by difficulties other families face. The insights argue strongly for sensitive support for all individuals coping with childhood AML.",,"['Centre for Social Science Research, School of Nursing and Health, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia. pam_mcgrath@bigpond.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with relatively selective activity against the Abelson (ABL) proto-oncogene, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-KIT receptor. Deregulated tyrosine kinase activity has been implicated as a central pathogenic event in a number of human malignancies, most notably chronic myeloid leukemia. In this myeloproliferative disorder the t(9;22) reciprocal translocation results in the generation of a novel fusion oncoprotein, BCR-ABL, with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib inhibits this activity, inducing remarkable rates of hematological and cytogenetic remission in excess of those seen with alternative medical therapies. Following a large phase III study comparing its efficacy with the combination of interferon alpha and low-dose cytarabine, it has emerged as the current gold standard therapy for patients with chronic-phase disease without a potential bone marrow donor and those considered unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation. Its integration into the management of those patients who might be considered for transplantation, which has historically been considered the only potentially curative approach, remains a major challenge. The increasing recognition and subsequent molecular characterization of resistance mechanisms has reinforced the need to exercise caution against deferring a proven curative therapy in favor of a treatment approach that is still investigational, with the spectre of increased numbers of patients progressing to sudden-onset blast crisis remaining the potential dark cloud in the silver lining for imatinib.",,"['Royal Free and University College, London Medical School, 98 Chenies Mews, London WC1E 6HX, UK. kpeggs@hotmail.com']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is attributed to the growing population of immunocompromised patients due to epidemic outbreak of AIDS or to other factors such as use of immunosuppressive drugs in recipients of organ transplantation. The available evidence has unequivocally established the endemic occurrence of blastomycosis, histoplasmosis and penicilliosis mameffei in India. In fact, pencilliosis marneffei has emerged as a major endemic mycosis of AIDS patients in Southeast Asia. It has manifestations simulating those of histoplasmosis capsulati, and it may spread to other regions with enlarging population of AIDS patients. Comprehensive studies are indicated in order to delineate the endemic areas of the afore-mentioned systemic mycoses. Among the other important systemic mycoses reported from India are aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, candidiasis and zygomycosis. Our current knowledge of the global distribution of systemic mycoses does not depict their true prevalence. It largely reflects the geographic distribution of medical mycologists or other investigators engaged in the study of fungal diseases and their research interests. Invasive aspergillosis has emerged as an important disease in patients with neutropenia and bone narrow transplant recipients, cryptoccosis, penicilliosis marneffei and pneumocystosis in patients with AIDS, fusariosis in patients with leukaemia receiving cytotoxic therapy, zygomycosis in diabetic patients and in patients on defroxamine therapy, and Malasseziafurfur infection in patients on total parenteral nutrition: Opportunistic systemic mycoses due to yeasts and yeast-like fungi have become commoner than those due to filamentous fungi, occupying fourth position in the list of bloodstream pathogens in some centers in USA. Also, their incidence, pattern of clinical presentations and species spectrum have significantly changed, largely due to more frequent and prolonged therapeutic or prophylactic use of antifungal drugs and subsequent development of resistance. Consequently, infections with resistant yeast-like fungi such as C. lusitaniae, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and Trichosporon ovoides (T. beigelii) have recently been reported with greater frequency. Since respiratory and systemic mycoses have no pathognomonic clinical or radiologic syndrome and mycological diagnostic facilities are restricted to only some of the major metropolitan centres, these diseases may be frequently confused with tuberculosis or other diseases of obscure etiology in India and other developing countries. Greater awareness and a high index of clinical suspicion are important pre-requisites for their diagnosis. Also, active collaboration of internists, pathologists, mycologists and microbiologists is advocated for their expeditous diagnosis and successful management. Further studies should focus on the development of rapid techniques for selective isolation and identification of systemic pathogenic fungi. The problem of antifungal resistance is likely to become more serious in the future as more and more patients with AIDS, bone marrow transplantation and neutropenia will require chemoprophylaxis cover against systemic fungal infections. Thus, it would be of vital importance to intensify search for more potent and less toxic antifungal drugs. It is recognized that an increasing number of people whose life is saved or prolonged due to successful treatment of their underlying diseases fall victim to opportunistic, life threatening systemic mycoses. A great majority of the deaths due to these infections occurs because they remain undiagnosed for want of mycological diagnostic services. In order to cope with the challenge of systemic mycoses, the health authorities of the developing countries are called upon to urgently take necessary measures for establishing a network of diagnostic mycology laboratories.",,"['Department of Medical Mycology, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, Delhi. vpci@delnet.ren.nic.in']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence alignments show that 6 of the 11 residues that constitute the RNase H primer grip have functional equivalents in murine leukemia virus (MLV) RT. We previously showed that a Y586F substitution in the MLV RNase H primer grip resulted in a 17-fold increase in substitutions within 18 nucleotides of adenine-thymine tracts, which are associated with a bent DNA conformation. To further determine the effects of the MLV RNase H primer grip on replication fidelity and viral replication, we performed additional mutational analysis. Using either beta-galactosidase (lacZ) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes, we found that S557A, A558V, and Q559L substitutions resulted in statistically significant increases in viral mutation rates, ranging from 2.1- to 3.8-fold. DNA sequencing analysis of nonfluorescent GFP clones indicated that the mutations in RNase H primer grip significantly increased the frequency of deletions between the primer-binding site (PBS) and sequences downstream of the PBS. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of reverse transcription products revealed that the mutant RTs were substantially inefficient in plus-strand DNA transfer relative to the wild-type control. These results indicate that the MLV RNase H primer grip is an important determinant of in vivo fidelity of DNA synthesis and suggest that the mutant RT was unable to copy through the DNA-RNA junction of the minus-strand DNA and the tRNA because of its bent conformation resulting in error-prone plus-strand DNA transfer.",,"['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,PMC538714,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR analyses of proviral integrations in the promoter region of the c-myc proto-oncogene in lymphomas induced by wild-type SL3-3 [SL3-3(wt)] and the enhancer deletion mutant displayed a difference in targeting frequency into this locus. We here report on patterns of proviral insertions into the c-myc promoter region from SL3-3(wt), the faster variant, as well as other enhancer variants from a total of approximately 250 tumors. The analysis reveals (i) several integration site hot spots in the c-myc promoter region, (ii) differences in integration patterns between SL3-3(wt) and enhancer deletion mutant viruses, (iii) a correlation between tumor latency and the number of proviral insertions into the c-myc promoter, and (iv) a [5'-(A/C/G)TA(C/G/T)-3'] integration site consensus sequence.

NIH/Swiss mice neonatally inoculated with MoFe2 developed T-cell lymphomas of immature thymocyte surface phenotype. MoFe2 integrated infrequently (0 to 9%) near common insertion sites (CISs) previously identified for either parent virus. Using three different strategies, CISs in MoFe2-induced tumors were identified at six loci, none of which had been previously reported as CISs in tumors induced by either parent virus in wild-type animals. Two of the newly identified CISs had not previously been implicated in lymphoma in any retrovirus model. One of these, designated 3-19, encodes the p101 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma. The other, designated Rw1, is predicted to encode a protein that functions in the immune response to virus infection. Thus, substitution of FeLV-945 U3 sequences into the M-MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) did not alter the target tissue for M-MuLV transformation but significantly altered the pattern of CIS utilization in the induction of T-cell lymphoma. These observations support a growing body of evidence that the distinctive sequence and/or structure of the retroviral LTR determines its pattern of insertional activation. The findings also demonstrate the oligoclonal nature of retrovirus-induced lymphomas by demonstrating proviral insertions at CISs in subdominant populations in the tumor mass.

The role of DNA repair gene XRCC1 in susceptibility to childhood ALL has, however, not been widely studied and no data exists from Indian children.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the frequency and tissue distribution of LIF in normal, hyperplastic and malignant endometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Paraffin-fixed endometrial tissue was obtained from normal premenopausal women (n = 15), endometrial hyperplasia (n = 20), endometroid adenocarcinoma (n = 32) and endometrial polyps (n = 9). The LIF expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical means and evaluated with a semi-quantitative immunoreactive score. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The lowest expression of LIF was observed in endometrial adenocarcinomas compared to all groups, while endometrial polyps expressed the highest LIF immunostaining. The expression in normal human glandular cells was significantly higher during the late secretory phase than in the proliferative phase. The highest expression of LIF was observed in endometrial polyps. Simple hyperplasia showed a significantly higher LIF expression than proliferative endometrium and adenocarcinoma. Adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) grade I-III had a significantly higher LIF expression than adenocarcinoma. The lowest expression of LIF was observed in adenocarcinoma, being statistically significant compared to all groups. CONCLUSION: LIF was immunohistochemically demonstrated in normal, hyperplastic and malignant endometrial tissue, suggesting a widespread but complex role for LIF in hyperplastic and malignant endometrial growth regulation.

The Rap1 activity in a CML cell line, K562, was also inhibited by imatinib. Inhibition of Rap1 activation by a dominant negative mutant of Rap1, Rap1-N17, or SPA-1 inhibited the BCR/ABL-induced activation of Elk-1. BCR/ABL also activated in a kinase activity-dependent manner the B-Raf kinase, which is an effector molecule of Rap1 and a potent activator of the MEK/Erk/Elk-1 signaling pathway. Together, these data suggest that, in addition to the well-established Ras/Raf-1 pathway, BCR/ABL activates the alternative signaling pathway involving Rap1 and B-Raf to activate Erk, which may play important roles in leukemogenesis.",,"['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Braf protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GTPase-deficient, constitutively activated mutant of Galpha(12) (Galpha(12)Q229L or Galpha(12)QL) has been previously shown to induce oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 cells promoting serum- and anchorage-independent growth. Reduced growth-factor dependent, autonomous cell growth forms a critical defining point at which a normal cell turns into an oncogenic one. To identify the underlying mechanism involved in such growth-factor/serum independent growth of Galpha(12)QL-transformed NIH3T3, we carried out a two-dimensional differential proteome analysis of Galpha(12)QL-transformed NIH3T3 cells and cells expressing vector control. This analysis revealed a total of 22 protein-spots whose expression was altered by more than 3-folds. Two of these spots were identified by MALDI-MS analysis as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and myeloid-leukemia-associated SET protein. The increased expressions of these proteins in Galpha(12)QL cells were validated by immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, transient transfection studies with NIH3T3 cells indicated that the expression of activated Galpha(12) readily increased the expression of SET protein by 24 h. As SET has been previously reported to be an inhibitor of phosphatase PP2A, the nuclear phosphatase activity was monitored in cells expressing activated Galpha(12). Our results indicate that the nuclear phosphatase activity is inhibited by greater than 50% in Galpha(12)QL cells compared to vector control cells. Thus, our results from differential proteome analysis presented here report for the first time a role for SET in Galpha(12)-mediated signaling pathways and a role for Galpha(12) in the regulation of the leukemia-associated SET-protein expression.",,"['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']","['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",,,['GM 49897/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a retrospective study of 45 patients older than 60 years of age, with AML, who were diagnosed and/or treated in our clinic in the year 2001. Our study refers to 32 men, 63-80 years of age and 13 women, 62-85 years of age. Fourteen of them were diagnosed as de novo leukemia while 31 developed secondary leukemia, due to myelodysplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia and essential thrombocytemia. A therapeutic protocol that included 2 courses of induction chemotherapy with idarubicin 8mg/m2 for 3 days, aracytin 100 mg/m2 for 5 days and etoposide 75 mg/m2 for 5 days, followed by 2 courses of consolidation chemotherapy with aracytin 800 mg/m2/d for 4 days, was administered. In patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we additionally administered all trans retinoic acid. Those with erythroleukemia also received erythropoietin, 10,000 IU 3 times a week. All patients received supportive therapy with blood products and G-CSF during blood marrow aplasia. Four patients refused therapy and three patients received only blood product support because of poor performance status. Nine out of the 38 patients who received chemotherapy (23.7%) achieved a complete remission after treatment, while, 13 out of 38 (34.2%) only a partial one (overall remission rate: 57.9 %). Ten patients relapsed in <6 months and 12 patients relapsed in >6 months. Patients who received only supportive treatment died 2-5 months after initial diagnosis. During therapy, 16 patients (42.1%) died due to: infection, cerebrovascular or gastrointestinal bleeding and acute myocardial infarction. In conclusion, it appears that a high percentage of the elderly patients with AML, despite the unfavourable prognosis, responded to chemotherapy (57.9%) and achieved longer survival durations compared to patients who refused therapy or received supportive treatment alone. Unfortunately, a large number of them exhibited serious complications during treatment, with a mortal outcome.

Data on cumulative exposures and relative risks for leukaemia in humans were derived from the open literature. METHODS: A variety of excess relative risk models were applied taking into consideration, in a life-table fashion, mortality from leukaemia by age. RESULTS: As an example of the outcome of the method, results are presented for a 1 ppm exposure (each year) lasting for a working lifetime. They show that in a population of 1,000 adult males experiencing mortality rates similar to those of the 1981 male population of England and Wales, occupational exposure to 1 ppm of 1,3-butadiene for each year of a working life (40 years between the age of 20 and 65) will cause from 0 to 7.1 extra leukaemia deaths between the age 20-85 years, in addition to the 5.1 leukaemia deaths expected to occur in the absence of exposure to 1,3-butadiene. A summary of the estimates, in terms of excess leukaemia deaths, obtained for 0.1 ppm, 0.2 ppm, 0.5 ppm, 1.0 ppm, 2.0 ppm, 5.0 ppm, and 10 ppm of exposure (each year) is also presented. CONCLUSIONS: The method can be applied to predict the risk of carcinogenic agents for which dose-response data exist and no health-based limit value can be established. Results are consistent with those of previous risk assessments based on similar assumptions",,"['Osservatorio Epidemiologico e Sistemi di Remunerazione, Direzione Generale Sanita, Regione Lombardia, Milano.

METHODS: Available evidence of the efficacy of radiotherapy in most clinical situations for leukemia and myeloma was identified through extensive literature reviews and treatment guideline searches. Epidemiologic data concerning the distribution of types, disease stages, and other factors that influence the use of radiotherapy were identified. Decision trees were constructed to merge the evidence-based recommendations with the epidemiological data to calculate the optimal proportion of patients who should receive radiotherapy according to the best available evidence. Actual radiotherapy utilization rates also were identified. RESULTS: The proportion of patients diagnosed with myeloma in Australia who should receive radiotherapy based on the evidence was 38%. There was wide variation in the proportion of patients who actually received radiotherapy for myeloma from 24% up to 55%. The recommended proportion of patients diagnosed with myeloma in Australia who, according to the best available evidence, should receive at least a single course of radiotherapy was 38%. The proportion of patients diagnosed in Australia with leukemia who should receive radiotherapy at some point in their management, according to the best available evidence, was calculated at 4%, which corresponded with actual practice. CONCLUSIONS: Further research will be required to determine why more patients who are diagnosed with myeloma are not treated with radiotherapy.",['(c) 2004 American Cancer Society.'],"['Collaboration for Cancer Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify genotypes, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was performed with a PCR-amplified 444 bp fragment of the env gene using endonucleases. Three genotypes (1, 3, and 5) were dominant in Japan, and were found in 48.3%, 32.7%, and 16.9% of PCR positive cattle, respectively. Of the cattle infected with genotype 1, 84.7% were strongly positive in the AGID test. Similarly, in cattle with genotype 3, 78.9% were strongly positive. However, only 59.1% of cattle with genotype 5 were strong positive. Three cattle showed unusual RFLP patterns and they were found to be infected with more than one genotype.

One genotype (Argentine) was present in all herds, and the Australian genotype was found in two herds. Phylogenetic analysis indicated four clusters. The first cluster was composed of the Argentine isolates and one from Brazil; the second was composed of several isolates found in European countries and one from Brazil; the third cluster was composed of BLV isolates found in Japan and Germany; the fourth cluster included American and Australian isolates and those from other countries.

Epub 2004 Dec 7.,"Costimulatory molecules such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 (CD11a), LFA-3 (CD58), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (CD54), neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (CD56), B7-1 (CD80), or B7-2 (CD86) are important regulatory elements in healthy immunological cascades, but their role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has only been rarely investigated. We studied their expression on mononuclear bone marrow (BM) cells from 105 patients with AML at initial diagnosis and evaluated their prognostic significance. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analyses were performed using antibodies directly conjugated with fluorescein. A BM sample was considered positive if more than 20% of the cells in the blast containing gate expressed the respective marker. The surface expression of CD11a (27 of 29 cases positive with an average of 71% positive blasts; 27(+)/29, 71%), CD54 (23(+)/33, 37%), CD56 (24(+)/93, 20%), CD58 (29(+)/29, 95%), CD80 (13(+)/28, 30%), and CD86 (19(+)/29, 39%) was measured. The expression of these markers in different French-American-British (FAB) classification types (M0-M5) was heterogeneous, except for CD56, which showed a higher proportion of positive cells in monocytic subtypes of AML. In addition, cases with a ""poor risk"" karyotype as well as patients succumbing to ""early death"" after double induction therapy according to the AML Cooperative Group (CG) protocol were characterized by a high expression of CD56. Relapse-free survival analyses demonstrated that patients with more than 8% CD56(+) cells in the BM relapsed significantly sooner. CD54 was preferentially expressed in AML M4(eo) and in addition in ""favorable"" cytogenetic risk groups and in cases that had responded to AML-CG therapy. Only very high proportions (>60%) of CD54(+) cells were associated with a lower probability for relapse-free survival. CD80 and CD86 expressions were similar in all FAB types. Patients who had responded to AML-CG therapy showed higher CD80 proportions and lower CD86 proportions compared to the ""nonresponder"" group. Whereas cases with more than 15% CD80(+) cells had a significantly lower probability for relapse-free survival, only cases with more than 65% CD86(+) were characterized by a significantly lower probability for relapse-free survival. Expression profiles of CD11a and CD58 were not associated with specific FAB types or prognostically relevant groups. We can conclude: (1) Expression of costimulatory molecules in AML is very variable. This reflects the great diversity of immunophenotypes in AML. (2) CD56 is mainly expressed in monocytic subtypes of AML. CD56(+) subtypes of AML seem to be a separate entity with a worse prognosis independent of the karyotype. (3) High expression of some costimulatory molecules correlates with a worse prognosis concerning relapse-free survival times.",,"['Med III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,20041207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Nov 15.,"Two 17-mer oligodeoxynucleotide-5'-linked-(6,7-diphenylpterin) conjugates, 2 and 3, were prepared as photosensitisers for targeting photooxidative damage to a 34-mer DNA oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) fragment 1 representing the chimeric bcr-abl gene that is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The base sequence in the 17-mer was 3'G G T A G T T A T T C C T T C T T5'. In the first of these ODN conjugates (2) the pterin was attached at its N3 atom, via a -(CH2)3OPO(OH)- linker, to the 5'-OH group of the ODN. Conjugate 2 was prepared from 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxypropyl)-6,7-diphenyl-4(3H)-pteridinone 10, using phosphoramidite methodology. Starting material 10 was prepared from 5-amino-7-methylthiofurazano[3,4-d]pyrimidine 4 via an unusual highly resonance stabilised cation 8, incorporating the rare 2H,6H-pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]oxazine ring system. In the characterisation of 10 two pteridine phosphazenes, 15 and 29, were obtained, as well as new products containing two uncommon tricyclic ring systems, namely pyrimido[2,1-b]pteridine (20 and 24) and pyrimido[1,2-c]pteridine (27). In the second ODN conjugate the linker was -(CH2)5CONH(CH2)6OPO(OH)- and was attached to the 2-amino group of the pterin. In the preparation of 3, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester 37 of 2-(5-carboxypentylamino)-6,7-diphenyl-4(3H)-pteridinone was condensed with the hexylamino-modified 17-mer.

Cleavage was observed at all guanine sites with a marked preference for cleavage at G14. In contrast, excitation of ODN-pteridine conjugate 2 in the presence of 1 caused oxidation of the latter predominantly at G18, with a smaller extent of cleavage at G15 and G14 (in the double-stranded portion) and G21.

Examination of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ATL patients as well as ATL-derived T cell lines showed an elevation of Cas-L in these cells. We showed that tyrosine phosphorylation as well as expression of Cas-L was markedly elevated through the induction of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax in JPX-9 cells, with these cells showing marked motile behavior on the ligands for integrins. We next performed yeast two-hybrid screening of cDNA library from an HTLV-I-transformed T cell line, which resulted in the identification of Tax as a putative binding partner for Cas-L. Co-precipitation experiments revealed that the serine-rich region of Cas-L might serve as the binding site with the highest affinity for Tax.

It has been reported that activating protein-1 (AP-1) is dysregulated by HTLV-1 infection. HTLV-1-encoded Tax elevates AP-1 activity through the induction of AP-1 family member gene expression, including c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, and Fra-1. However, the precise mechanism by which HTLV-1 regulates AP-1 activity remains to be addressed. Recently, a novel viral protein named HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor, HBZ, has been shown to interact with c-Jun and repress c-Jun-mediated transcription by abrogating its DNA-binding activity. In the course of investigating HBZ function, we found that HBZ reduced the steady-state levels of c-Jun, and the levels were restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Together, this indicates that HBZ promotes c-Jun degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Furthermore, HBZ deletion mutants revealed that both the N-terminal and leucine-zipper region of HBZ were required for the elimination of c-Jun. These results suggest dual effects of HBZ on the suppression of AP-1 activity by inhibiting c-Jun function, which may contribute to the dysregulation of cell proliferation.",,"['Laboratory of Human Tumor Viruses, Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P53 inactivation is an additional genetic alteration that occurs in late-stage leukemic progression associated with in vivo and in vitro immortalization. Since p53 protein expression levels are low, to undetectable, in primary erythroleukemic cells that express elevated levels of Fli-1, we investigated the potential regulation of p53 by Fli-1. We assessed whether the overexpression of Fli-1 could partially regulate p53 via modulation of its well-established regulator, MDM2. In this paper, we demonstrate that the promoter of MDM2 contains a consensus binding site for Fli-1 that is bound by this transcription factor in vitro and in vivo, resulting in MDM2 transcriptional regulation. We further substantiate these observations in vivo by demonstrating a positive correlation in the expression of Fli-1 and MDM2, and a negative correlation with p53 in leukemic tissues obtained from mice with Friend Disease.

Antibody-based therapies for AML have, therefore, focused on CD33 as a suitable tumor-associated target antigen. The most promising results have been obtained with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg), a humanized IgG(4) anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody joined to a calicheamicin-gamma(1) derivative. Engagement of CD33 by GO results in immunoconjugate internalization and hydrolytic release of the toxic calicheamicin moiety, which, in turn, causes DNA damage and cell death. Since 2000, when GO was approved for clinical use, treatment trials and pilot studies have revealed potential expanded applications along with additional limitations. At the same time, correlative biological and in vitro functional studies have further characterized CD33 expression patterns in AML, the significance of CD33-antibody interactions, pathways involved in GO-induced cytotoxicity and potential drug resistance mechanisms. This review summarizes the recent data addressing mechanisms of GO action and discusses their relevance with regard to clinical applications and the limitations of using experimental model systems to mimic in vivo conditions.

However, the participation of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in the monocytic differentiation activity of IL-6 at low concentrations has not been well clarified. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-6 (10 ng/ml) alone increased cell growth without differentiation. In the presence of vanadate (10 microM), a PTP inhibitor, IL-6 induced pronounced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest; this effect was associated with CD14+ monocytic differentiation as well as F-actin filament polymerization. Furthermore, vanadate potentiated IL-6-signaling pathway by increasing the tyrosine phosphorylated levels of STAT3 (Tyr705), and Lyn. Such induction of Lyn kinase activity resulted from hypophosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr507) at its negative regulatory site. Vanadate also cooperated with IL-6 to form a protein complex containing Lyn and an actin-associated protein, AFAP110. A complex between Lyn and AFAP110 may serve to regulate F-actin filament polymerization. In conclusion, inhibition of PTP by vanadate promotes hematopoietic differentiation activity of IL-6 through modulating multiple signalings, particularly actin filament polymerization.","['2004 National Science Council, ROC and S.

These leukemic stem cells are necessary and sufficient to maintain the leukemia. Interestingly, the BCR/ABL fusion gene, which is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), was also detected in the endothelial cells of patients with CML, suggesting that CML might originate from hemangioblastic progenitor cells that can give rise to both blood cells and endothelial cells. Here we isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1+) cells carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene from the bone marrow of 17 Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) patients with CML and found that these cells could differentiate into malignant blood cells and phenotypically defined endothelial cells at the single-cell level.

We previously showed that the intracellular synthesis of BCR components, from transcription onward, is normal. Here, we investigated the glycosylation status and cellular localization of mu, CD79a, and CD79b chains in 10 CLL patients differing in surface immunoglobulin M (IgM) expression. We reported a severe impairment of the glycosylation and folding of mu and CD79a. These defects were associated with the retention of both chains in the endoplasmic reticulum and lower levels of surface IgM expression. In contrast, no clear impairment of glycosylation and folding was observed for CD79b. No sequence defects were identified for BCR components and for the chaperone proteins involved in BCR folding processes. These data show, for the first time, that lower levels of BCR surface expression observed in CLL are accounted for by an impaired glycosylation and folding of the mu and CD79a chains.",,"[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Plate-forme de Microscopie Electronique, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France. vuillier@pasteur.fr""]","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,20041209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene coding for NQO1 is subject to a genetic polymorphism at nucleotide position 609 (C-->T) of the human NQO1 cDNA. Heterozygous individuals (C/T) have intermediate activity and homozygotes for the variant allele (T/T) are deficient in NQO1 activity. In previous studies, genotypes conferring lower NQO1 activity have been associated with an increased risk of acute leukemia, particularly infant leukemia carrying MLL/AF4 fusion genes. In the present study, we investigated this association in our population and extended the analysis to other subgroups of pediatric hematologic neoplasms characterized by specific fusion genes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 138 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carrying distinct fusion genes (MLL/AF4=35; BCR/ABL=31; TEL/AML1=72), 71 cases of pediatric sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma and 190 healthy control individuals for the NQO1 C609T polymorphism. RESULTS: When compared to the healthy control group, only children with Burkitt's lymphoma significantly more often had NQO1 genotypes associated with lower NQO1 activity (odds ratio, 1.81; p=0.036), predominantly at a younger age (< 9 years at diagnosis: odds ratio, 3.02; p=0.003).

We investigated the mechanism of action of this antibody in vitro against different neoplastic B cells and compared it to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. DESIGN AND METHODS: Complement-mediated cytotoxicity assays were performed on freshly isolated neoplastic cells using human serum as the source of complement. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was evaluated by chromium release assays, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effector cells, before and after 2 days of culture with interleukin-2 (IL-2). RESULTS: Alemtuzumab lysed cells from the 23 B-CLL samples through complement activation (mean 80%) much more efficiently than rituximab did (mean 16%), presumably because of the higher expression of CD52 than of CD20. All other leukemic B cells, including 1 prolymphocytic leukemia, 2 hairy cell leukemias and 6 B-non Hodgkin's lymphomas were effective targets for both antibodies, with 88% and 85% mean lysis, respectively. Both CD52 and CD20 were highly expressed in these cells. In contrast, most neoplastic B cell samples were poorly lysed through ADCC using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effectors with either monoclonal antibody and regardless of target antigen levels. ADCC was, however, significantly increased in all cases by culturing the effector cells with IL-2 for 2 days. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Complement-mediated lysis is likely to be an important mechanism of action of alemtuzumab in B-CLL and combination with IL-2 may increase this antibody's efficacy through ADCC. Mature neoplastic B cells other than B-CLL express high levels of CD52 and are good targets for alemtuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity.",,"['Laboratory of Cellular and Gene Therapy G.

This study tests the hypothesis that soluble p53 alone and in association with CD38 can enucleate B-CLL subsets at worse prognosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Wild and mutant forms of p53 protein were evaluated in 197 B-CLL patients at diagnosis or before progression by an immunoenzymatic method in plasma using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. CD38 expression was analyzed by a multicolor flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: Higher levels of both soluble p53 (sp53) and CD38 were significantly correlated with intermediate and high Rai stages, with higher beta2-microglobulin and soluble CD23 values, determined at diagnosis. Shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were both observed in sp53+ and CD38+ patients (p<0.0001). Simultaneous positivity or negativity for sp53 and CD38 identified two subsets of patients, the former with a worse prognosis and the latter with a better prognosis with regard to PFS (p<0.0001) and OS (p<0.0001). The predictive value of sp53 and CD38 was retained among the patients within the intermediate Rai risk group. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: sp53 and CD38 together with ZAP-70 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. With regard to PFS, ZAP-70, sp53 and CD38 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors.

Common gamma-chain signaling cytokines (gammac-cytokines) - interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9 and 15 - differentially regulate T-cell development, survival, proliferation and differentiation. Although studies exist on some individual cytokines, no comprehensive analysis of the effects of the Zc-cytokine family on malignant T cells has been reported. Here, we examined the effect of Zc-cytokines on T-ALL proliferation. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary leukemic cells were collected at diagnosis from the blood or bone marrow of children with T-ALL. The cells were immunophenotyped and classified according to maturation stage. Proliferative responses to gammac-cytokines were assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: All gammac-cytokines promoted proliferation of primary T-ALL cells. Interleukin (IL)-7 was the cytokine that most frequently induced leukemic cell proliferation and promoted the most robust responses. IL-4 preferentially stimulated proliferation of samples with a more mature immunophenotype, whereas CD1a-positive cortical T-ALL cells were less responsive to IL-9. Finally, combinations of two Zc-cytokines showed synergistic or additive proliferative effects. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that all the gammac-cytokines tested can stimulate proliferation of leukemic T cells and suggests that synergistic effects may occur in vivo. We present the first demonstration that IL-9 and IL-15 can provide a proliferative signal to T-ALL cells. Importantly, our results support the hypothesis that IL-7 may function as a critical regulator of T-ALL and that its activity may be potentiated by other Zc-cytokines.",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']","['0 (IL2RG protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Interleukin-9)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,['P01-CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, proteasome inhibitors can induce selective apoptosis in some malignant cell types as opposed to in their normal counterparts and first generation compounds are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The objective of our study was to develop a method to extract and measure functional proteasome activity in primary human cells so that this method could then be used to determine whether patients might benefit from proteasome inhibitor therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Optimal proteasome extraction and assay conditions were established with myeloma and leukemic cell lines. These conditions were then applied to primary human cells from patients. Proteasome was extracted using lysis buffer and activity measured as turnover of a peptide fluorescent substrate. RESULTS: Cells expressing bcr-abl showed significantly higher proteasome levels (372+/-16 AFU/1x10(6) cells/min) than did bcr-abl-negative cells (151+/- 8 AFU/1x10(6) cells/min) and were more sensitive to induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitor. Human myeloid leukemia cell lines showed higher levels of activity than those representing myeloma (eg HL-60 cells 947+/-25 AFU/1x10(6) cells/min; U266 177+/-6 AFU/1x10(6) cells/min). Primary cells from patients had similar levels of activity to those of the comparable cell line model.

The intensity 0.3 W/cm(2) was used for cell killing experiments and 0.5 W/cm(2) for free radical experiments. Free radical production was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-spin trapping with DMPO while cell killing was determined by assays for lysis, loss of cell viability, apoptosis and necrosis. The results show that at higher cell densities, CO(2) in the medium rapidly increased, with shorter pre-sonication incubation required to attain complete inhibition of both free radical production and cell killing. Cell killing at 0.3 W/cm(2) and free radical production at 0.5 W/cm(2) were both inhibited at 10 million cells/ml without incubation, and at 2 million cells/ml incubated for 2 h before sonication.

Previously, we demonstrated that DPD inhibited the growth of human colon cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the anticancer effects of DPD on two human leukemia cells lines. DPD exerted growth inhibitory activities in vitro against two human leukemia cell lines, the promyeloid line HL-60 and the lymphoblastic line Molt-3. The in vivo effect of tumor growth suppression by DPD was also observed in mouse xenografts. No acute toxicity was observed after an intra-peritoneal challenge of DPD in ""severe combined immune-deficiency"" (SCID) mice twice a week. The in vitro study showed HL-60 was more sensitive to DPD than Molt-3 through induction of G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest with the appearance of a hypodiploid DNA fraction. The increased superoxide (O(2)(-)), dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase 3, and increase in annexin V binding were evident before apoptosis in DPD-treated cells. The superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mRNA expression was also decreased in DPD-treated HL-60 and Molt-3 cells. Thus, it appeared that inhibition of SOD might be the major cause for the production of cellular superoxide with concomitant decrease of H(2)O(2) in DPD-treated cells. Addition of antioxidant can reduce DPD-induced mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and annexin V binding in HL-60 cells. The results suggest that the cellular generation of O(2)(-) plays a role in initiating and coordinating DPD-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis of HL-60 cells.

We present a simple stepwise approach for prioritization of pesticides as part of the exposure assessment strategy in an ongoing case-control study on pesticides and childhood leukemia in Costa Rica. Pesticide imports between 1977 and 2000, approximately the pertinent exposure period, were surrogates for use data. In the first phase, 323 active ingredients were identified, of which 219 were eliminated based on low usage and absence or negative results in a preliminary search in three major toxicity databases. In the second phase, the remaining 104 pesticides underwent scoring for their toxicodynamic potential (TDP) with regard to carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and teratogenicity, weighted in this order. Bioavailability was assessed when TDP was multiplied by a weight for persistence and bioaccumulation, producing the intrinsic toxic potential (ITP). ITP was multiplied by an index of quantity (QI) of pesticide used in the exposure period, resulting in a weighted toxic potential (WTP). The top 25 positions in each of the four rankings (TDP, ITP, QI, and WTP) yielded together 64 highest-priority pesticides. This prioritization process has to be complemented with a further breakdown into crop-, time-, and biocide-specific shortlists to achieve a recall tool suitable for developing countries. Different parameters for prioritization assure inclusion of all relevant pesticides with regard to toxicity and bioavailability. The method contributes to cancer epidemiology in developing countries with access to basic use data and the Internet.

The majority of allergic reactions to food proteins are immediate type hypersensitivity reactions in which the principal biological effector is IgE antibody; the accurate measurement of specific IgE antibody is therefore a critical factor in experimental systems designed to characterize protein allergenic potential. Due to the presence of much higher concentrations of other immunoglobulin isotypes, the assessment of specific serum IgE antibody poses substantial technical challenges. We have examined the utility of the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line for the measurement of murine IgE responses. RBL cells were sensitized with mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody and challenged with DNP-albumin conjugates with various hapten substitution ratios (SR). Polyclonal anti-OVA IgE antisera were also assessed for activity in the RBL assay. Results were compared with titers measured in homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) assay. Marked degranulation of RBL cells was induced by conjugates with SRs of between 16 and 32, whereas conjugates with lower SRs (of 10 or 3) failed to elicit significant serotonin release. All conjugates were able to induce mast cell degranulation in vivo in a PCA assay. Anti-OVA antisera with PCA titers of 1/32 to 1/64 failed to stimulate RBL cell degranulation, whereas high titer antibody (1/2048 to 1/4096 by PCA) induced a positive RBL cell response. Successful stimulation of RBL cell degranulation requires not only appropriate epitope densities but also high affinity antibody. These data indicate that this assay is inappropriate for the routine analysis of specific polyclonal IgE antibody responses such as those that are induced by exposure to complex protein allergens.",,"['Syngenta Central Toxicology Laboratory, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire SK10 4TJ, UK. rebecca.dearman@syngenta.com']","['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of spectrin arrangement in human peripheral lymphoid (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and leukaemic (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) cells before and after chemotherapy revealed radical differences in the distribution of this protein. By using immunofluorescent technique, in lymphocytes isolated before chemotherapy, we found spectrin evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, while after the therapy changes in spectrin organisation occurred. Moreover, in lymphocytes after chemotherapy, extraction with buffer containing non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100) revealed presence of an insoluble fraction of spectrin. In normal or malignant cells before chemotherapy spectrin was totally soluble, however it should be mentioned that in total cell extracts and supernatants (but not in pellets) apoptotic fragments of spectrin (in addition to intact alpha and beta chains) were also found. In malignant cells after chemotherapy changes in PKC theta; organisation, similar to this observed in the case of spectrin, were shown by the immunofluorescence technique. In contrast, no differences in the distribution of other isoforms of protein kinase C: betaI and betaII, before and after chemotherapy, were found. Apoptotic phosphatidyloserine (PS) externalisation, as well as cell shrinkage, membrane protrusions and blebbing were observed in lymphocytes after chemotherapy and treatment with cytostatics in vitro.

To establish the feasibility of using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study cognitive deficits in survivors of childhood cancer, we tested the hypothesis that this population has the same BOLD response to visual stimulation as healthy subjects. We used BOLD fMRI to measure spatial and temporal patterns of brain activity after brief visual stimulation in 16 survivors of childhood cancer, 11 age-similar healthy siblings of survivors, and 16 healthy adults. Functional data for the survivors were analyzed with two general linear models, one used a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the other used a Fourier set as basis functions. The measured BOLD signal and brain activation patterns were similar in the survivors with both models. The BOLD signal for survivors was qualitatively similar in timing and shape, but there were significant quantitative differences as compared with healthy subjects. The activation was normally located in the primary visual cortex in 13 survivors, but the activation volume was significantly smaller in brain tumor survivors than in other groups.

Between October, 1999, and June, 2003, 61 patients with acute leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia received allogeneic peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from HLA-identical siblings. Thirty-four were conditioned with myeloablative protocols and twenty-seven with RIC regimens. The patients in the myeloablative group were younger (29 vs. 37 years; p < 0.0003), most of them were transplanted in complete remission (74% vs. 59%; p < 0.03), had a shorter interval between diagnosis and HSCT (12 vs. 21 months; p < 0.02) and a greater proportion belonged to standard-risk prognosis (68% vs. 48%; p < 0.1). The median times to neutrophil, platelet and red blood cell engraftment for the myeloablative and RIC groups were 14 versus 11 days (p < 0.009), 17 versus 9 days (p < 0.0001), and 19 versus 12 days (p < 0.007), respectively. Transfusion requirements were lower in the RIC group. Severe mucositis was present in 32% and 7%, respectively (p < 0.01). The proportion of patients having acute graft versus-disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, and infections was the same, as well as early and late mortality, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Analyzing all the patients together, three factors significantly influenced overall survival: standard risk patients, complete remission at transplant, and the absence of severe acute GVHD.

The fate of these cells appears to be determined in part by intrinsic genetic programs and also by the influence of extracellular signals in the local environment. The extent of lineage determination once neural crest cells have migrated to the first branchial arch is not clear, although branchial arch pattern is not thought to be the result of crest predetermination. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that ectomesenchymal cells of the first branchial arch show properties of pluripotent stem cells, the lineage of which may be directed by specific molecular signaling. Ectomesenchymal cells were enzymatically isolated from the mandibular processes of BALB/c mice and maintained in an undifferentiated state while cultured with leukemia inhibitory factor or induced to differentiate by lineage-specific induction factors or growth conditions, including transforming growth factor beta, forskolin, and a mineralization-promoting medium. Morphological observations and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cells could be induced to differentiate into smooth muscle cells, glial cells, and osteoblasts, respectively. In the presence of the mineralization-promoting medium, alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly and mineralization nodules formed. The data reported support the concept that many, although not all, first branchial arch-derived ectomesenchymal cells show properties of multipotent stem cells, the subsequent fate of which can be influenced by induction factors and growth conditions. Some cells, however, showed a degree of commitment with respect to their fate. The possible application of first branchial arch-derived stem cells to tissue engineering of the orofacial tissues should involve consideration of the developmental stage of cell harvesting and the desired cell fate.",,"[""Department of Oral Histology and Pathology, College of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Platelet concentrate supernatants contain high concentrations of biologic mediators that might impair immunity. We investigated whether washed platelet and red cell transfusions could improve clinical outcomes in adult patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: A pilot randomized trial of washed, leukoreduced ABO identical transfusions versus leukoreduced ABO identical transfusions was conducted in 43 adult patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia during 1991-94. Primary endpoints to be evaluated were platelet transfusion refractoriness, infectious and bleeding complications and overall survival. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in infectious or major bleeding complications and only one patient required HLA matched platelet transfusions. Minor bleeding was more frequent in the washed, leukoreduced arm of the study. Confirmed transfusion reactions were more frequent in the leukoreduced arm of the study. Overall survival was superior in the washed arm of the study (40% versus 22% at 5 years), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.36). A planned subset analysis of those </=50 years of age found that those in the washed, leukoreduced arm (n = 12) had a 75% survival at five years compared with 30% in the leukoreduced arm (n = 10) (p = 0.037) CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of washed platelets, and also raises the possibility of improved survival. We speculate that transfusion of stored red cell and platelet supernatant may compromise treatment, particularly in younger patients with curable disease.

In the present study, it was investigated whether the water-soluble antioxidants ascorbic acid (ASA), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) can enhance both the antioxidant and anticancer activity of quercetin in human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60 cells). Proliferation, viability and ROS accumulation (indicated by the level of malondialdehyde, MDA) was significantly decreased by QU in HL-60 cells. 50 microM H2O2 markedly attenuated the antioxidant and anticancer activity of QU, proving that diminution of ROS accumulation considerably contributes to the QU-induced decrease of HL-60 cells proliferation and viability. When the effects of water-soluble antioxidants were tested, ASA at 1 mM, NAC at 500 microM, or GSH at 250 microM significantly enhanced QU-mediated proliferation arrest, cell death and ROS diminution. These results indicate that certain amounts of ROS are critical for the proliferation and viability of HL-60 cells, while water-soluble antioxidants enhance the anticancer activity of QU through scavenging ROS.

A likely consequence will be to increase the predictive and prevention capacities of medicine, including common diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and others. The most common variability of the genome are the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), every person having between 3 and 10 million of them. SNPs may or not be harmless, and studies are in progress in cases and controls studies to answer the question of whether they determine why some persons have a given disease and others do not, and if they have something to do with that the individual variation in the response to drugs. We discuss in the same context the haplotype map project (HapMap) as a tool to facilitate the study of possible associations of genome changes and common diseases. We discuss the most successful effort in gene therapy, that of severe combined immunodeficiency, in which 17 out of 18 patients responded well to the procedure, although 2 of them developed late side effects in the form of acute leukemia, very likely related to the therapy.

One potential mechanism of apoptosis induced by benzene metabolites that has not been examined is the production of pro-apoptotic cytokines such as endothelial IL-8 from endothelial cells in bone marrow stroma. In this study, we utilized HL-60 cells which are known to produce the endothelial form of IL-8 (elL-8) and human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC) as model systems. Hydroquinone (HQ), Catechol (Cat) and benzenetriol (BT) all induced eIL-8 production and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. HQ induced a marked 50-70-fold stimulation of eIL-8 levels and HL-60 cells were shown to have the eIL-8 receptor, CXCR I thus enabling an autocrine pathway of apoptosis. However, treatment with recombinant elL-8 failed to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells as previously reported and antibodies to either IL-8 or CXCRI did not significantly abrogate benzene metabolite-induced apoptosis. HQ and Cat but not BT also induced stimulation of elL-8 production in HBMEC. These data demonstrate that although metabolites of benzene induce marked stimulation of eIL-8, this is unlikely to be responsible for apoptosis induced in HL-60 cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cellularity in haematopoietic tissues of C3H mice infected with FLV and/or whole-body irradiation was examined. RESULTS: When mice were treated with a sublethal dose (3 Gy) of irradiation at 1 week after virus infection, most manifested a severe loss of cellularity in the spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood 2 weeks after irradiation. More than 90% of the mice died within 1 month post-irradiation. However, this deleterious effect of virus infection on the survival of irradiated mice was observed only when they were irradiated at around 1 week after virus inoculation. Strain differences in the sensitivity to this effect were observed among virus-sensitive strains of mice.

METHODS: The full-length sequences of TRF1(TRF1FL) and its mutant with N and C terminus deletion (TRF1DeltaNC) were generated by PCR amplification, the resulting fragments were cloned into pEGFP-C2 mammalian expression vector. GFP-tagged proteins were verified by Western blotting with rabbit anti-TRF1 and mouse anti-GFP antibodies after cell transfection. Immunofluorescence staining were performed to detect the TRF1 localization in HeLa and WI38-2RA cells. Metaphase spreads from HeLa cells were also prepared to observe TRF1 localization in chromosomes. HeLa cells were arrested by thymidine and nocodazole at different cell stages. Cell cycles were analyzed by flow cytometry and TRF1 levels were evaluated by semi-quantitative Western blotting. RESULTS: TRF1FL and TRF1PNC fragments were sized about 1.3 kb and 0.95 kb. GFP-tagged TRF1FL and TRF1DeltaNC proteins were 80 kD and 60 kD, respectively. In both HeLa and WI38-2RA cells, TRF1FL had a speckled distribution in the nuclei,however, TRF1FL did not coincide with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body in HeLa cells while it exclusively did in WI38-2RA cells. Moreover, TRF1FL was exactly localized at the termini of metaphase spreads in HeLa cells. In contrast, TRF1PNC was diffusely distributed throughout the nuclei. Analysis by semi-quantitative Western blotting indicated that TRF1 levels increased with cell cycle progression, which reached the zenith at the M phase and went down to the nadir at G1/S point. The TRF1 level at M phase was about 3.9 times than that at G1/S point(t=12.92iP<0.01). CONCLUSION: TRF1 has a different localization in telomerase-positive and telomerase-negative cells, which suggests TRF1 might exert different functions in these cells.

It induces differentiation of several kinds of cancer by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity. We have reported that butyrate stimulates hepatocellular carcinoma cells into their normal phenotype. Since sodium butyrate affects both differentiation and apoptosis, we investigated expression of bcl-2-related genes in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCC-T. The expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1/EAT was up-regulated 4 h after the treatment, while pro-apoptotic Bax expression did not change. Gene expressions in the early stage of butyrate-stimulation were investigated by the differential display assay and the cDNA expression array. Laminin and keratin 18 were increased 6 h after the stimulation with sodium butyrate. The results of cDNA expression array revealed up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitory genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor, and interferon-related genes such as STAT2 and 3, while down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin E. Up-regulated production of p21WAF-1 and Mcl-1/EAT was also confirmed by Western blotting. The cytoskeletal change indicated by up-regulation of laminin and keratin 18 may be an important factor in the decrease in malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Up-regulation of interferon-related genes indicated that butyrate-treatment might induce a similar phenotypic change to that induced by type 1 interferons.

It is recognized that the curative potential of allo-SCT relates closely to the immune advantage conferred by allogeneic T-lymphocytes. In allo-SCT donor T-lymphocytes favor engraftment, provide early immune reconstitution, and fight the underlying malignancy--the so-called graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect. These benefits are counterbalanced by the occurrence of a life-threatening disease: graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). A suicide gene encodes a protein able to convert a nontoxic prodrug into a toxic product. Therefore, cells expressing the suicide gene become selectively sensitive to the prodrug.

Epub 2004 Dec 7.,"Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements are associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The frequent inversion of chromosome 16 creates the CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene that encodes the fusion protein CBFbeta-SMMHC. This fusion protein inhibits the core-binding factor (CBF), resulting in a block of hematopoietic differentiation, and induces leukemia upon the acquisition of additional mutations. A recent genetic screen identified Plag1 and Plagl2 as CBF beta-SMMHC candidate cooperating proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that Plag1 and Plagl2 independently cooperate with CBF beta-SMMHC in vivo to efficiently trigger leukemia with short latency in the mouse. In addition, Plag1 and Plagl2 increased proliferation by inducing G1 to S transition that resulted in the expansion of hematopoietic progenitors and increased cell renewal in vitro. Finally, PLAG1 and PLAGL2 expression was increased in 20% of human AML samples. Interestingly, PLAGL2 was preferentially increased in samples with chromosome 16 inversion, suggesting that PLAG1 and PLAGL2 may also contribute to human AML. Overall, this study shows that Plag1 and Plagl2 are novel leukemia oncogenes that act by expanding hematopoietic progenitors expressing CbF beta-SMMHC.",,"['Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation St, LRB/622, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']","['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLAG1 protein, human)', '0 (PLAGL2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,20041207,['R01 CA096983-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, development of inhibitors and/or antibodies that specifically target FLT3 has been of substantial interest. In this regard, phase 1 and 2 trials involving FLT3 inhibitors have recently reported FLT3 inhibition and leukemic blast reduction in some patients. Despite this, issues such as specificity and resistance need to be addressed. Consequently, the development of alternative approaches for targeting FLT3 would be of great consequence. In the present report, we demonstrate that FLT3 siRNA effectively down-regulates FLT3 expression in Ba/F3 cells transfected with FLT3 containing an activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain and FLT3-ITD-positive Molm-14 human leukemia cells. Treatment with the FLT3 siRNA results in growth inhibition and apoptosis of these cells. Furthermore, siRNA-induced down-regulation of FLT3 increased the sensitivity of both cell lines to treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor MLN518.

Aims of this large descriptive repeated survey were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of different techniques in diagnostic samples obtained at several disease course time points and to correlate positive results with patient clinical features and outcome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BM aspirates, trephine biopsies, PB, and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) samples from Italian children with neuroblastoma were analyzed by morphological and histologic techniques, as well as by immunocytochemistry (IC) for disialoganglioside GD(2) and reverse transcription-PCRs (RT-PCRs) for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and pgp9.5 genes. The diagnostic odd ratio (DOR) was used to measure the accuracy of the different techniques. RESULTS: A total of 2,247 evaluations were done on 561 BM, 265 PB, and 69 PBSC samples from 247 patients. IC showed the best accuracy. Whereas TH RT-PCR accuracy was satisfactory, that of pgp9.5 was very low. Positive results obtained by IC in BM and PB samples at diagnosis from stage 1, 2, and 3 patients correlated with unfavourable outcome. No correlation was found between positive results obtained by IC or TH RT-PCR in BM, PB, and PBSC samples from stage 4 patients and their outcome.

But its prognosis is not known in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, the prognosis of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and BCRP in patients treated homogeneously by the same anthracycline (daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone) during all of the treatment with aracytine is not known. Therefore, we have evaluated the relationship between drug resistance phenotype, in vitro anthracene sensitivity, and the relation to treatment outcome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have analyzed 149 AML treated according to protocol of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer group. The prognostic value of BCRP and Pgp were analyzed in the whole population and according to intercalating agent. RESULTS: BCRP was a prognostic factor, for achievement of complete remission (43% in positive patients and 69% in negative patients, P = 0.005), the 4-year disease-free survival (12% versus 33%, P = 0.03), and the 4-year overall survival (19% versus 38%, P = 0.003). When BCRP expression and Pgp function were categorized in three groups, +/+, +/- or -/+, and -/-, the achievement of complete remission was 45%, 66%, and 90% (P = 0.0003), the 4-year disease-free survival was 8%, 26%, and 40% (P = 0.01), and the 4-year overall survival was 16%, 37%, and 48% (P = 0.001), respectively. Pgp function was a prognostic factor in patients treated by daunorubicin and idarubicin but not by mitoxantrone. In contrast, BCRP expression was a prognostic factor in patients treated by daunorubicin and mitoxantrone but not by idarubicin.

Both IFN-gamma and LIF are produced by maternal cells and tissues at the fetal-maternal interface, whereas the IFN-gamma receptors (IFN-gamma R1 and IFN-gamma R2) and LIF receptor are abundantly expressed on the surface of placental trophoblasts. The effect of IFN-gamma on T lymphocyte activation is influenced by the relative membrane density of its two receptors, particularly IFN-gamma R2. In this study we report that in PE (25-40 wk gestation) and PE complicated by IUGR, IFN-gamma R2 protein expression is severely down-regulated and is similar to that observed in early placenta (7-10 wk gestation) developing under low O(2) tension. IFN-gamma production was found to be inversely related to the IFN-gamma R2 protein expression, and LIF receptor protein expression in PE mimicked that in early placental development. These results show that in PE, placental trophoblasts fail to establish an early to late switch with respect to IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma R2 expression. This supports the hypothesis that trophoblasts control the polarization of maternal immune effectors and cytokine profiles at the fetal-maternal interface that could be subject to oxidative stress in PE.",,"[""Harris Birthright Research Center for Fetal Medicine, King's College Hospital Medical School, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, UK. dr_sbanerjee@hotmail.com""]","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,20041207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, syngeneic tumor cells genetically modified to express B7.1 (CD80) have been shown to induce rejection of previously established murine solid tumors, and transduction with IL-2 can further increase survival. However, poor rates of gene transfer and inefficient expression of multiple transgenes encoded by single vectors have hampered the development of such autologous tumor cell vaccines for clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Here we describe the development of a self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding B7.1 and IL-2 as a single fusion protein postsynthetically cleaved to generate biologically active membrane-anchored B7.1 and secreted IL-2. This enables the efficient transduction of both established and primary AML blasts, resulting in expression of the transgenes in up to 98% of the cells following a single round of infection at an m.o.i. of 10. The combined expression of IL-2 and B7.1 in AML blasts enables increased stimulation of both allogeneic and autologous T cells. The stimulated lymphocytes secrete greater levels of Th1 cytokines and show evidence of specificity, as indicated by their increased proliferation in the presence of autologous AML compared to remission bone marrow cells.",,"[""Department of Hematological and Molecular Medicine, Guy's, King's, and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, University of London, London SE5 9NU, UK.""]","['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mercury is a well-known health hazard and an environmental contaminant. Recently, information about the uptake of the heavy metals such as mercury has been suggested. However, little is known regarding molecular mechanisms of exporting mercury. This study was designed to determine if mercury could be extruded by MRP1 in acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML-2). The MRP-1-overexpressing AML-2/DX100 cells showed a higher resistance to mercury than AML-2/WT. Probenecid, which is a specific MRP1 inhibitor, decreased the resistance to mercury. Exposing the AML-2 cells to mercury-induced MRP1 gene expression and production without altering the MRP1 activity. Mercury activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and SB 203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, blocked the mercury-induced MRP1 production.

Because HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients usually have a higher provirus load than asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers (ACs), and p12(I) had been suggested to confer a proliferative effect on HTLV-I-infected cells in vitro, it is possible that the relatively unstable p12K is less frequent in HAM/TSP patients than in ACs. To elucidate whether p12K and other alterations in the p12 gene were related to the outcome of HTLV-I infection, we sequenced the p12 gene in 144 HAM/TSP patients, 41 adult T cell leukemia (ATL) patients, and in 46 ACs. p12K was observed in only two HAM/TSP patients, but was not present in either ATL patients or ACs. Interestingly, a premature termination codon in the p12 was observed in 5.6% of HAM/TSP patients and in 4.9% of ATL patients but none was found in ACs. The p12 initiation codon was destroyed in one HAM/TSP patient. These HTLV-I variants with truncated p12 protein or with a destroyed initiation codon in the p12 gene appeared to have been transmitted in the subjects' families. These findings suggest that p12 is dispensable for the transmission and maintenance of HTLV-I infection, although it is premature to conclude that sequence varitation in the p12 gene is associated

A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of low-dose PLT transfusions and to determine the need for further studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 111) with acute leukemia or undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation were randomly assigned to receive low-dose (3 PLT units) or standard-dose (5 PLT units) prophylactic PLT transfusions and were monitored daily for bleeding. Using a sequential Bayesian design, the difference in major bleeding events was determined. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with major bleeding events was 10.7 percent (95% credible region, 5.1%-21.2%) in the low-dose PLT group and 7.3 percent (95% credible region, 2.9%-17.2%) in the standard-dose PLT group. The two additional events in the low-dose group occurred when the PLT count exceeded 100 x 10(9) per L. There is an 89 percent probability that the absolute increase in major bleeds is less than 10 percent with low-dose PLT transfusions. The number of minor bleeding events was higher in the standard-dose group. Patients receiving low-dose PLT transfusions received 25 percent fewer PLT units. There was an 89 percent probability that low-dose transfusions reduced PLT utilization in patients with acute leukemia and a 60 percent probability in patients undergoing PBPC transplantation. CONCLUSION: Low-dose PLT transfusions appear to be safe and effective and reduce PLT utilization. They should be further evaluated in clinical trials designed to evaluate equivalency.",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital and University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. atinmouth@ottawahospital.on.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,['Transfusion. 2004 Dec;44(12):1680-2.

METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis of R-band was used to detect the abnormalities of chromosome 7 in 410 acute leukemia patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two cases (7.8%) with abnormalities of chromosome 7, of which 19 (59.4%) had -7/7q-; 3(9.4%) had t(7;11); and the rest had other abnormalities such as der(7), +7, t(2;7), t(5;7), t(7;9), t(7;8) and dic(1;7). The incidence of -7/7q- in M0, M1 and M2 was higher than that in other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Twenty cases had additional cytogenetic aberrations, such as t(9;22) with -7, +8, -5. In 30 cases treated with chemotherapy, 11 cases acquired complete remission (CR) and the CR rate was lower than that for all concurrent cases of acute leukemia(36.7% vs 65.8%); the CR rate of AML with -7/7q- was lower than that of AML with normal karyotype(25% vs 55.6%). There was no difference in the CR rate between acute lymphocytic leukemia(ALL) with -7/7q- and ALL with normal chromosome (57.1% vs 77.8%), but 4 cases with -7/7q- which attained complete remission for a time relapsed early. In other 11 patients with additional chromosome 7 aberration, only 4 patients acquired CR. CONCLUSION: -7/7q- was the frequent aberration in chromosome 7 anomaly, which was often detected in M0, M1 and M2. It might be associated with the pathogenesis of acute leukemia; the patients with chromosome 7 anomaly had poorer prognosis.",,"['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Medical College, Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003 P.

Parenteral therapy with amphotericin B alone or amphotericin B in combination with fluconazole or intrathecal administration of amphotericin B failed to eradicate C. albicans in the cerebrospinal fluid. After 7 days of caspofungin therapy, however, the cerebrospinal fluid became sterile and the patient gradually regained consciousness. She was discharged 1 month after completing 4 weeks of caspofungin therapy. There were two critical issues we thought to be relevant to the favorable outcome of this case. First, isolation of C. albicans was achieved by inoculating enriched liquid medium with cerebrospinal fluid. Second, there is a potential therapeutic benefit of caspofungin in treating a fungal infection of the central nervous system.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, No. 138, Sheng Li Rd., 704 Tainan, Taiwan.']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",,,,,,,,PMC535248,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2004 Dec 6.,"Immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides (IS ODN) can mediate a number of immunologic effects. We previously demonstrated that treatment of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells with one class of IS ODN, CpG ODN, alters their phenotype and increases their immunogenicity. Here, we demonstrate that in contrast to the classic understanding of CpG ODN as inhibitors of B cell apoptosis, IS ODN including CpG ODN induce apoptosis in B-CLL cells. It is important that these changes are seen not only with CpG ODN but with ODN that lack the classical CpG motif. B-CLL cells from 20 subjects were treated in vitro with IS ODN for up to 7 days. IS ODN treatment resulted in increased numbers of apoptotic cells in 13 out of 20 B-CLL samples. IS ODN enhanced apoptosis in samples with 13q deletion as a single aberration and had a heterogeneous effect on apoptosis in samples with other aberrations including 17p deletion, 11q deletion, or trisomy 12. Induction of apoptosis did not correlate with expression of the CpG ODN receptor Toll-like receptor 9. Apoptosis was dependent on the activation of caspases and was accompanied by up-regulation of CD95/Fas and its ligand. We conclude that IS ODN including CpG ODN can induce apoptosis of most B-CLL samples. The ability of IS ODN to induce apoptosis differs based on cytogenetic status. Up-regulation of CD95/Fas may play a role in IS ODN-induced apoptosis of B-CLL.",,"['Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, 5970Z JPP, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,20041206,"['P50 CA 97274-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 77764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous analysis of the in vivo functions of Pbx1 by targeted mutagenesis in mice has revealed roles for this gene in skeletal patterning and development and in the organogenesis of multiple systems. Both RNA expression and protein localization studies have suggested a possible role for Pbx1 in pharyngeal region development. As several Hox mutants have distinct phenotypes in this region, we investigated the potential requirement for Pbx1 in the development of the pharyngeal arches and pouches and their organ derivatives. Pbx1 homozygous mutants exhibited delayed or absent formation of the caudal pharyngeal pouches, and disorganized patterning of the third pharyngeal pouch. Formation of the third pouch-derived thymus/parathyroid primordia was also affected, with absent or hypoplastic primordia, delayed expression of organ-specific differentiation markers, and reduced proliferation of thymic epithelium. The fourth pouch and the fourth pouch-derived ultimobranchial bodies were usually absent. These phenotypes are similar to those previously reported in Hoxa3(-/-) single mutants and Hoxa1(-/-);Hoxb1(-/-) or Hoxa3(+/-);Hoxb3(-/-);Hoxd3(-/-) compound mutants, suggesting that Pbx1 acts together with multiple Hox proteins in the development of the caudal pharyngeal region. However, some aspects of the Pbx1 mutant phenotype included specific defects that were less severe than those found in known Hox mutant mice, suggesting that some functions of Hox proteins in this region are Pbx1-independent.",,"['Department of Genetics, University of Georgia, Life Sciences, B 420A, Athens, GA 30602, USA. nmanley@uga.edu']","['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD35920/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD43997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD035920-07/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marinesco bodies (MBs) are eosinophilic ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions found in pigmented neurons of the human substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Traditionally considered non-pathological entities, more recent studies have indicated that MBs are associated with the age-associated degenerative changes in the substantia nigra and striatal loss of dopaminergic terminals. In the present morphological study of the human substantia nigra, we demonstrate colocalization, contiguity, and focally shared immunoreactivity between MBs and neuronal intranuclear rodlets (INRs). The latter nuclear structures of uncertain function are markedly decreased in the cortex of Alzheimer's disease, but not dementia with Lewy bodies.

The session on graft engineering presented the latest results in the search for the optimal graft. The graft-vs.-leukemia effect in the haploidentical transplant was discussed in depth.

Epub 2004 Oct 2.,"Expression of the cancer-testis antigen Taxol resistance-associated gene-3 (TRAG-3) protein is associated with acquired paclitaxel (Taxol) resistance, and is expressed in various cancer types; e.g., breast cancer, leukemia, and melanoma. Thus, TRAG-3 represents an attractive target for immunotherapy of cancer. To identify HLA-A*02.01-restricted epitopes from TRAG-3, we screened cancer patients for spontaneous cytotoxic T-cell responses against TRAG-3-derived peptides. The TRAG-3 protein sequence was screened for 9mer and 10mer peptides possessing HLA-A*02.01-binding motifs. Of 12 potential binders, 9 peptides were indeed capable of binding to the HLA-A*02.01 molecule, with binding affinities ranging from strong to weak binders. Subsequently, lymphocytes from cancer patients (9 breast cancer patients, 12 melanoma patients, and 13 patients with hematopoietic malignancies) were analyzed for spontaneous reactivity against the panel of peptides by ELISpot assay. Spontaneous immune responses were detected against 8 epitope candidates in 7 of 9 breast cancer patients, 7 of 12 melanoma patients, and 5 of 13 patients with hematopoietic malignancies. In several cases, TRAG-3-specific CTL responses were scattered over several epitopes. Hence, no immunodominance of any single peptide was observed. Furthermore, single-peptide responses were detected in 2 of 12 healthy HLA-A2(+) donors, but no responses were detectable in 9 HLA-A2(-) healthy donors or 4 HLA-A2(-) melanoma patients. The identified HLA-A*02.01-restricted TRAG-3-derived epitopes are targets for spontaneous immune responses in breast cancer, hematopoietic cancer, and melanoma patients. Hence, these epitopes represent potential target structures for future therapeutic vaccinations against cancer, possibly appropriate for strategies that combine vaccination and chemotherapy; i.e., paclitaxel treatment.",,"['Tumor Immunology Group, Danish Cancer Society, Institute for Cancer Biology, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CSAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)']",,20041002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant promoter methylation is the major mechanism of gene silencing in tumors. We examined 150 lymphoid/hematopoietic tumors or potential premalignant specimens, 55 control specimens and 12 EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cultures and 10 lymphoma/leukemia (L/L) or multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines for the methylation (and, in cell lines, of the expression status) of three genes involved in the cytokine signaling pathway. The genes were: SHP1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase; SYK, a protein kinase; and SOCS1, a suppressor of cytokine signaling. Our major findings were: (1) one or more of the three genes was frequently methylated in L/L and MM cell lines and there was good concordance (90-100%) between methylation and loss of gene expression; (2) treatment of L/L cell lines with a demethylating agent resulted in re-expression of SHP1 protein and downregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 in L/L cell lines; (3) all 55 control specimens and the lymphoblastoid cultures were negative for methylation of the three genes; (4) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (100%), and leukemias (94%) had almost universal methylation of SHP1 and relatively less frequent (<30%) methylation of SOCS1 and SYK; (5) MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) had infrequent methylation of SHP1 (<20%), and occasional methylation of SOCS1 and SYK; and (6) comparable methylation frequencies for SOCS1 were observed in MM and MGUS, suggesting that SOCS1 methylation is an early event in MM pathogenesis. At least one gene was methylated in 119 of 130 (93%) of the malignant and 12 of 20 (60%) of the MGUS samples.

The transforming ability of HTLV-I has been largely attributed to the viral protein Tax, which modulates the activity of several well-known cell cycle regulators. An important cell cycle regulator, the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, is often inactivated in many cancers including virally induced cancers. Upon examination of Rb status, we observed a decrease in Rb protein expression in HTLV-1-infected cell lines as well as in ex vivo ATL patient samples. Transient transfection assays indicated that decreased Rb protein levels were Tax dependent. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Tax directly associates with Rb. This interaction was localized within the B pocket of Rb and the C-terminus of Tax (aa 245-353). Within the C-terminus of Tax, we have identified an LXCXE-like motif, that when mutated resulted in the loss of Tax/Rb interaction.

We found that CXCR5 was selectively frequently expressed on T-cell-lineage acute (chronic) lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) CD8(+)CD34(+) T cells, but not on T-ALL CD4(+)CD34(+), CD4(+)CD34(-), and CD8(+)CD34(-) T cells.

Since HOXB4-expanded HSCs retain normal differentiation potential and there is no leukaemia development from transduced HSCs, HOXB4 represents a promising tool for human HSC therapy. However, the increased proliferation capacity of HOXB4 overexpressing fibroblasts resulting from upregulation of JunB, Fra-1 and cyclin D1 protein levels may indicate a potential risk associated with the HOXB4 overexpression approach. This prompted us to investigate the proliferation rate, differentiation and expression of cell cycle regulators directly in bone marrow cultures overexpressing HOXB4. Here we show that in comparison to neo-transduced control bone marrow cultures, HOXB4-overexpressing cultures had a more homogenous morphology and increased numbers of haematopoietic progenitor cells capable to generate primitive colonies in vitro. In contrast, neo-transduced bone marrow cells in long-term cultures showed hallmarks of myeloid differentiation and a reduced secondary colony forming activity. We further show that multilineage repopulating activity in vivo, which was present only in HOXB4 long-term cultures, declined over time. HOXB4 overexpression in vitro did not result in an increase but in a stabilization of the proliferation rate (1.4-1.8 cell divisions per day), while the proliferation rate of control neo-transduced bone marrow cultures gradually declined. Correspondingly, increased HOXB4 expression was paralleled by decreased expression levels of cyclins, CDKs and AP-1 family members. These results suggest that the growth rate of HOXB4- compared to neo-transduced bone marrow cells remains constant in long-term cultures along with a suppression of myeloid differentiation. In contrast to HOXB4 overexpression in fibroblasts, bone marrow cells engineered to overexpress HOXB4 do not upregulate AP-1 complex members or cyclins indicating that HOXB4 acts in a cell type-specific way.",,"['Institut fur Medizinische Strahlenkunde und Zellforschung, University of Wurzburg, D-97078 Wurzburg, Germany.']","['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the molecular mechanism mediating IFN-induced apoptosis, we analysed programmed cell death in response to type I (IFNalpha) or type II (IFNgamma) treatment in relation to p53 status. In two cell lines (MCF-7, SKNSH), IFNalpha, but not IFNgamma, enhanced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, only IFNalpha upregulated p53 as well as p53 target genes (Noxa, Mdm2 and CD95). The apoptotic response to IFNalpha decreased in the presence of ZB4, an anti-CD95 antibody, suggesting that CD95 is involved in this process. When p53 was inactivated by the E6 viral protein or the expression of a p53 mutant, IFNalpha-induced apoptosis and p53 target genes upregulation were abrogated. Altogether these results demonstrate that p53 plays a pivotal role in the IFNalpha-induced apoptotic response. IFNalpha-induced PML was unable to recruit p53 into nuclear bodies and its downregulation by siRNA did not alter CD95 expression. In contrast, IFNgamma-induced apoptosis is p53-independent. CD95 and IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) are directly upregulated by this cytokine. Apoptotic response to IFNgamma is decreased in the presence of ZB4 and strongly diminished by IRF1 siRNA, implicating both CD95 and IRF1 in IFNgamma-induced apoptotic response.

Cells cultured in the presence of EPO exhibited an elevated apoptotic response to cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin (Dauno) and vinblastine (VBL). Chemosensitization by EPO did not involve an increase in p53 activation, yet correlated with enhanced Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial membrane perturbation and caspase maturation. In vitro monotherapy with Dauno or VBL induced the degradation of IkappaBalpha, provoked the translocation of NF-kappaB p65/50 to the nucleus and stimulated the expression of an NF-kappaB-activatable reporter gene. All these signs of NF-kappaB activation were perturbed in the presence of EPO. Inhibition of JAK2, one of the receptor-proximal elements of EPO-mediated signal transduction, greatly diminished the EPO-mediated chemosensitization and NF-kappaB inhibition. EPO lost its death-facilitating effects in the presence of an NF-kappaB inhibitor, underscoring the cause-effect relationship between EPO-mediated chemosensitization and NF-kappaB inhibition.

The AKXD recombinant inbred mice are predisposed to a variety of leukemias and lymphomas as a result of viral integration. One common insertion site, the ecotropic viral insertion site 3 (Evi3), has been implicated in most B-cell tumors in the AKXD-27 strain. The Evi3 gene encodes a zinc-finger protein with sequence similarity to the Early B-cell Factor-Associated Zinc-finger gene (EBFAZ). We show that the Evi3 gene is overexpressed in several tumors with viral insertions at Evi3, which results in the upregulation of Early B-cell Factor (EBF)-target gene expression, suggesting that Evi3 modulates EBF activity. Reconstitution of primary leukemia cells showed that these tumors express high densities of the B-cell surface proteins CD19 and CD38, which are EBF targets. Using a transactivation assay, we show that the terminal six zinc-fingers of Evi3 are required for modification of EBF activity. This is the first evidence that Evi3 expression in tumors alters the level of EBF target genes, and the first characterization of the Evi3 protein domains required for modulation of EBF activity.

All 40 patients underwent clinical evaluation, and periodontal tissue radiographic evaluation and assessment of ANCA through an enzyme-linked immunoasorbent assay (ELISA); this was done using an IMMCO Diagnostic commercial kit. RESULTS: No Significant differences in the gingivitis average index, plaque and bone loss between the experimental and the control group were evidenced. A significant correlation between gingivitis and ANCA was not evidenced either. Nevertheless, 7 out of 20 patients of the experimental group turned out to be ANCA positive. In contrast, no positive cases were reported in the control group. (p < 0.05 Fisher Test). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the presence of ANCA is probably related to ongoing immune alterations in patients suffering from leukemia but not related to gingivitis.",,"['Instituto de Investigaciones, Division de Posgrado, Facultad de Odontologia, Universidad del Zulia. nviera@net-uno.net']","['0 (Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with imatinib mesylate results in a high frequency of complete cytogenetic response, which can be further stratified using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We have serially monitored peripheral blood and bone marrow BCR-ABL transcripts using qRT-PCR in CML patients commencing imatinib therapy, and compared the results with bone marrow cytogenetics. Seventeen patients (aged 25-74 yr) with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in first chronic phase were treated with imatinib targeting a dose of 400 mg/d. The median follow up is 30 mo (range 9-33 mo). Every third month the product of the BCR-ABL fusion gene was evaluated in both blood and bone marrow specimens by real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan probe system. In 113 simultaneously obtained blood and bone marrow samples, the BCR-ABL transcript values agreed well with cytogenetic data. Blood and bone marrow specimens gave comparable values for BCR-ABL transcripts. Before start of imatinib therapy there was a considerable variation in BCR-ABL transcripts among the patients, ranging approximately one log (base 10). Similarly, patients with a complete cytogenetic response following imatinib therapy had variable BCR-ABL transcript levels, ranging at least three logs (base 10). The major decline in BCR-ABL transcripts occurred within 6 mo after start of imatinib therapy. The decline in BCR-ABL transcripts, following imatinib therapy, appears to level off at 12-15 mo. Two late responders were identified with a still decreasing level in BCR-ABL transcripts after 24 mo of treatment. It is concluded that BCR-ABL mRNA quantification in peripheral blood is suitable for routine monitoring of the response to treatment and long-term disease status in CML, especially in patients who have achieved a complete cytogenetic response. A plateau in BCR-ABL transcripts seems to have been reached after 12-15 mo of imatinib treatment; however, some ""late responders"" are seen.",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Haematology section, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, SE-413 45 Goteborg, Sweden. mats.hardling@medic.gu.se']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was observed that fibrosis mostly occurs focally or patchy, and collagen deposits were found very rarely (only four patients). The histopathology of bone marrow biopsies revealed several differences between fibrotic and non-fibrotic MDS: cellularity is significantly higher, dysmegakaryopoiesis is more pronounced, plasmocytes and mast cells are more often increased, and disturbance of marrow topography (particularly of the MK- and G-line) can be found more frequently in MDS with myelofibrosis. Reticulin fibrosis occurred in all subtypes of MDS; however, there was a higher incidence in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The frequency of abnormal growth of GM-progenitors was significantly higher in the MDS cases with myelofibrosis, compared to the cases without fibrosis. Clinical data showed significantly higher WBC, more frequent presence of immature granulocytes, and higher percentage of myeloblasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow in MDS with myelofibrosis compared to cases without myelofibrosis. Life expectancy was reduced to 13 mo, compared with 35 mo in MDS without fibrosis (p=0.00055). Time to leukemic transformation was 32 mo in MDS with fibrosis, compared with >56 mo in MDS without fibrosis (p=0.015).

These agents are effective at producing remissions but are not curative.Thus, new drugs are still needed to improve the outcome of patients with CLL. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and alemtuzumab, provides a novel therapeutic modality.Rituximab is an active agent in CLL. Standard doses of rituximab result in higher response rates in previously untreated than in relapsed patients but low complete response (CR) rates. Rituximab is most effective in combination with chemotherapy, especially fludarabine-based regimens in the first-line and salvage setting. Rituximab is also useful in the treatment of complications of CLL, such as pure red cell aplasia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Alemtuzumab has impressive activity in patients with refractory CLL and may play an important role in the consolidation treatment of CLL. Alemtuzumab is most efficacious at clearing disease in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Bulky lymphadenopathy is less sensitive to therapy.
