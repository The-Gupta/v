MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 216 patients with Ph-negative MPN included in the study. Prevalence of thrombosis and presence of CRF were determined by processing the medical documentation. RESULTS: The age older than 60 years (RR=1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-2.98; p=0.043 and RR=2.04, 95% CI =1.12-3.68; p=0.02) and CRF (RR=2.25, 95% Ccapital I, Ukrainian =1.21-4.16; p=0.005 and RR=2.31, 95% Ccapital I, Ukrainian =1.20-4.41; p=0.008) are predictors of thrombosis in all patients with PV and with spontaneous PV, respectively. Age over 60 years and CRF in all patients with ET associates with an increase of the relative risk of thrombosis (RR=2.5, 95% Ccapital I, Ukrainian =1.05-5.92; p=0.047 and RR=2.74, 95% Ccapital I, Ukrainian =1.18-6.23; p=0.026). Frequency of recurrent thrombotic complications in patients with ET and thrombosis in anamnesis is significantly higher than in patient's without history of thrombotic complication (RR=2.75, 95% Ccapital I, Ukrainian =1.15-6.51; p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm previous results of other studies reporting that the age over 60 years, history of thrombosis, CRF influences on thrombosis development in Ph-negative MPN patients.","['Mishhenjuk O.

AIMS: To explore differences in oocyte stimulation for fertility preservation (FP) patients based on cancer diagnosis. SETTINGS AND DEIGN: Between 2005 and 2011, 109 patients elected to pursue FP at a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome variables between four cancer diagnostic groups (breast, gynecologic, lymphoma/leukemia and other) and age-matched male factor or tubal factor infertility IVF control group were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ANOVA and Chi-square analyses were employed to compare variables between the groups that were normally distributed. Kruskal-Wallis with subsequent Mann-Whitney U-test were used for data that were not normally distributed. RESULTS: Women with gynecologic malignancies were significantly older than the women in the other three groups, but tended to have a better ovarian response. Women with hematologic malignancies were most likely to have been exposed to chemotherapy and had the longest stimulations with a similar number of oocytes retrieved. The age-matched IVF controls had higher peak estradiol levels, number of oocytes obtained, and fertilization rates when compared to cancer patients with or without a history of prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Factors including age, type of cancer and chemotherapy exposure, can influence response to ovarian stimulation.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) serves as first line of pathological investigations, but there are pros and cons involved. AIM: The main objective of the present study was to establish adequacy of the procedure and to find out diagnostic pitfalls. An attempt was made to analyze inconclusive and inadequate aspirations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 400 consecutive fine-needle aspirates of liver, belonging to 328 cases over a period of 2 years, were analyzed. Hematoxylin and eosin and May-Gromicronnwald-Giemsa stains were used. Chi-square test was carried out to compare significant degree of difference in different kind of diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 400 aspirations, 289 (72.2%) were adequate, 75 (18.7%), inconclusive and 36 (9%), inadequate. Among positive aspirations the most common was metastatic adenocarcinoma, 128 (44.2%). The positive diagnosis and adequate aspirations were significantly high (P < 0.0001). Major differential diagnostic problems were: Distinguishing the poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma from the metastatic adenocarcinoma; and leukemia/lymphoma from other malignant round cell tumors. Common diagnostic pitfalls were repeated aspirations from the necrotic area and aspiration of atypical, disorganized and reactive hepatocytes, adjacent to a metastasis. No complications were observed. CONCLUSION: FNAC can be used successfully for the diagnosis of liver and gallbladder lesions, thus avoiding open biopsy.

X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type-2 (XLP-2) is associated with deficiency in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), with poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Here we showed that XIAP deficiency selectively impaired B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mediated innate responses to dectin-1 ligands but did not affect responses to various Toll-like receptor agonists. Consequently, Xiap(-/-) mice became highly vulnerable on Candida albicans infection. The compromised early innate responses led to the persistent presence of C albicans and inflammatory cytokines in Xiap(-/-) mice. Furthermore, priming of Xiap(-/-) mice with the dectin-1 ligand curdlan alone resulted in XLP-2-like syndromes. Restoration of dectin-1-induced Rac1 activation and phagocytosis by resolvin D1, but not up-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB, rescued Xiap(-/-) mice from C albicans lethal infection. Therefore, development of XLP-2 in XIAP-deficient patients could be partly due to sustained inflammation as a consequence of defective BCL10-dependent innate immunity toward specific pathogens. Importantly, our results suggest the potential therapeutic value of resolvin D1 in the treatment of XLP-2 and innate immunodeficiency syndromes.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Hsieh, Wan-Chen', 'Chuang, Ya-Ting', 'Chiang, I-Hsuan', 'Hsu, Shu-Ching', 'Miaw, Shi-Chuen', 'Lai, Ming-Zong']","['Hsieh WC', 'Chuang YT', 'Chiang IH', 'Hsu SC', 'Miaw SC', 'Lai MZ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Birc4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pam(3)CSK(4) peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '0 (dectin 1)', '6930DL209R (curdlan)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)', 'PG6M3969SG (lysophosphatidic acid)', 'V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)', 'Lymphoproliferative Syndrome, X-Linked, 2']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Candida albicans/drug effects/physiology', 'Candidiasis/*immunology/microbiology/*pathology', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', '*Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/agonists/metabolism', 'Lipopeptides/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'beta-Glucans']",,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/02/28 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39688-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-564609 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Oct 30;124(18):2847-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-564609.

RESULTS: PROVIVO is comprised of a total of 49 items capturing the experience of physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms. To improve the instrument's utility for clinical decision-making, questions soliciting limitations in activities of daily living, frequent infections, and overall well-being were added. Cognitive debriefings demonstrated that items were well understood and relevant to the SCT survivor experience. Scale Content Validity Index (CVI) (0.94) and item CVI (median = 1; range 0.75-1) were very high. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative and quantitative data provide preliminary evidence supporting the content validity of PROVIVO and identify a PRO-CTCAE item bundle for use in SCT survivors. A study to evaluate the measurement properties of PROVIVO and to examine its capacity to improve survivorship care planning is underway.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite these improvements, the majority of patients still relapse and become refractory to rituximab. Further efforts to improve anti-CD20 mAb efficacy have recently focused on obinutuzumab /GA101, a novel anti-CD20 mAb glycoengineered to display enhanced Fc-mediated effector mechanisms and induce direct cell death. AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview of the current insights into the mechanisms of action of obinutuzumab focusing on how structural modifications and differences to rituximab led to designation of obinutuzumab as a type II antibody. We summarize data from preclinical studies and recent clinical trials including the Phase III trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which led to FDA approval in November 2013. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical data are now emerging confirming the promise of the initial preclinical data that demonstrated superior efficacy of obinutuzumab over rituximab at similar dosing. The emerging randomized Phase III data from older comorbid patients with previously untreated CLL demonstrated significant improvements in molecular remission rates and median progression-free survival of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil versus rituximab plus chlorambucil. This emerging data provide reasons to be optimistic that outcomes for patients with B-cell malignancies can be further improved with obinutuzumab.",,"['Illidge, Tim', 'Cheadle, Eleanor J', 'Donaghy, Claire', 'Honeychurch, Jamie']","['Illidge T', 'Cheadle EJ', 'Donaghy C', 'Honeychurch J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD20', 'antibody', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'glycoengineering', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'obinutuzumab']",2014/09/06 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.948414 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Oct;14(10):1507-17. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.948414.

In this study, we examined whether the widely expressed serine threonine tyrosine kinase 1 (STYK1)/novel oncogene with kinase domain (NOK) acts as a drug resistance factor in acute leukemia. The transfection of leukemic HL-60 cells with an STYK1 expression vector resulted in the resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide and decreased drug-induced caspase-3/7 activity and sub-G1 population. To investigate the mechanism of STYK1-induced drug resistance, microarray analysis was performed using HL-60 cells transfected with control or STYK1 expression vectors. Three tyrosine kinases (EphA4, FLT4 and STK31), two NF-kappaB inducers (MAPK4 and TNF-RSF11A), and two genes essential for stem cell replication (SALL4 and NOV) were identified as novel STYK1-induced genes. In addition to the data using cell line, a comparison of the leukemic patients who did and did not respond to therapy revealed that STYK1 expression before therapy was significantly higher in the non-responder group compared with the group that responded completely. These results suggest that STYK1 is a novel drug resistance factor and could be a predictor of the therapeutic response in acute leukemia.",,"['Nirasawa, Shinya', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Kondoh, Takashi', 'Kuribayashi, Kageaki', 'Tanaka, Maki', 'Yanagihara, Nozomi', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Nirasawa S', 'Kobayashi D', 'Kondoh T', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Tanaka M', 'Yanagihara N', 'Watanabe N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (STYK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transfection']",,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2633 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Nov;45(5):1867-74. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2633.

We found that, similar to the other retroviruses, gag gene expression of MuLV and XMRV depends on post-transcriptional regulation mediated via an RNA sequence overlapping the pro-pol open reading frame, termed the Post-Transcriptional Element (PTE). PTE function can be replaced by heterologous RNA export elements, e.g. CTE of simian type D retroviruses. Alternatively, Gag particle production is achieved using an RNA/codon optimized gag gene. PTE function is transferable and can replace HIV Rev-RRE-regulated expression of HIV gag. Analysis of PTE by SHAPE revealed a highly structured RNA comprising seven stem-loop structures, with the 5' and 3' stem-loops forming an essential bipartite signal. MuLV and XMRV PTE share 98% identity and have highly similar RNA structures, with changes mostly located to single-stranded regions. PTE identification strongly suggests that all retroviruses and retroelements share common strategies of post-transcriptional gene regulation to produce Gag. Expression depends on complex RNA structures embedded within retroviral mRNA, in coding regions or the 3' untranslated region. These specific structures serve as recognition signals for either cellular or viral proteins.","['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2014.', 'This work is written by (a) US Government employee(s) and is in the public domain', 'in the US.']","['Pilkington, Guy R', 'Purzycka, Katarzyna J', 'Bear, Jenifer', 'Le Grice, Stuart F J', 'Felber, Barbara K']","['Pilkington GR', 'Purzycka KJ', 'Bear J', 'Le Grice SF', 'Felber BK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry', '*Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['gku798 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku798 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014;42(17):11092-106. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku798.

METHOD: Totally 285 children ALL patients who were diagnosed and systematically treated according to CCLG-2008 in Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, from April 2008 to August 2011 were prospectively selected. Among these cases, 62.8% (n = 179) were boys and 37.2% (n = 106) were girls and the median age was 5.3(0.5-14.0). The patients who were at high-risk group initially were excluded. The grouping of cases: the patients were divided into two groups according to the dates of initial diagnosis. Group I had 126 patients who were initially diagnosed between April 2008 and December 2009 in whom therapeutic regimen was not adjusted by reassignment of risk group by MRD. Group II had 159 patients who were initially diagnosed between January 2010 and August 2011 whose therapeutic regimen was adjusted by reassignment of risk group by MRD at specific time (33rd day of induction chemotherapy and 12 weeks after the beginning of chemotherapy). MP-FCM Coulter FC-500 was used in the detection of MRD. RESULT: Among these 285 patients, 94.0% (n = 268) were diagnosed as B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 6.0% (n = 17) were T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In group I, 61.9% (n = 78) patients belonged to low-risk group, 38.1% (n = 48) median-risk; in group II, before the adjustment, the rates of the low-risk group and median-risk group were 68.6% (n = 109) and 31.4% (n = 50) , respectively, while after the adjustment they were altered to 53.5% (n = 85) and 39.6% (n = 63) , furthermore 6.9% (n = 11) patients went into the high-risk group. Both groups were followed up for 2.5 years after their diagnoses, the disease of 7.4% (n = 21) patients relapsed, and the rates of two groups were 12.7% (n = 16) and 3.1% (n = 5) respectively, P = 0.009. The rate of serious infection (such as sepsis, pulmonary infection) of all these patients was 32.3% (92/285) , there was no significant difference between the two groups [28.6% (36/126) vs.35.2% (56/159) , P = 0.392]. The mortality of all these patients was 6.7% (19/285) , and that of group I was higher than that of group II [10.3% (13/126) vs. 3.8% (6/159) , P = 0.044]. The 2.5 years overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of group I were all lower than those of group II in Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis (all P < 0.05). The two groups were followed up for 2.5 years after their diagnoses, after elimination of the confounding influence of sex, age, FAB subtype, WBC count, ratio of blast cells in bone marrow at diagnosed, chromosome karyotype and fusion gene, reassignment of risk group by MRD was used to calculate the OS, EFS and DFS of ALL patients (all P < 0.05). After the adjustment the risk group was more significant in the assessment of prognosis.

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 63-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was treated with fludarabine; rituximab and fludarabine; fludarabine, cyclophsphamide and rituximab; and lenalidomide. While he underwent chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed with PML. After stabilization of PML, the patient underwent non-myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and ability to induce apoptosis of the anti-neoplastic agents cyclophosphamide (CYC), chlorambucil (CBL), cytosine arabinoside (ARA), dexamethasone (DEX), doxorubicin (DOX), etoposide (ETO), lomustine (LOM), prednisone (PRED) and vincristine (VINK) against GL-1, CL-1, CLBL-1 and Jurkat cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine cell viability and level of apoptosis, three different tests were performed: Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT), annexin V/propidium iodide (An/PI) staining and flow cytometric DNA fragmentation. RESULTS: All tested substances exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of the examined cell lines with a different level of apoptosis induction. VINK and DOX strongly decreased the viability of canine cell lines, whereas CYC induced the highest level of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Canine lymphoma (CL-1, CLBL-1) and leukemia (GL-1) cell lines are a useful tool for developing new and more effective treatment regimes for canine neoplasia.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Pawlak, Aleksandra', 'Rapak, Andrzej', 'Zbyryt, Iwona', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz, Bozena']","['Pawlak A', 'Rapak A', 'Zbyryt I', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', '*Leukemia/metabolism', '*Lymphoma/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Canine lymphoma', 'apoptosis', 'canine leukemia', 'cytotoxicity']",2014/09/06 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['28/5/843 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2014 Sep-Oct;28(5):843-50.,28,,"['Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland aleksandra.pawlak@up.wroc.pl.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Immunobiology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there have been recent advances regarding its treatment, mortality remains high. Consequently, therapeutic alternatives continue to be explored. In the present report, we present evidence that sodium caseinate (CasNa), a salt of the principal protein in milk, may possess important anti-leukaemic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: J774 leukaemia macrophage-like cells were cultured with CasNa and proliferation, viability and differentiation were evaluated. These cells were also inoculated into BALB/c mice as a model of leukemia. RESULTS: We demonstrated that CasNa inhibits the in vitro proliferation and reduces viability of J774 cells, and leads to increased survival in vivo in a leukaemic mouse model.

Studies of WT1-knockout mice confirmed the important role of WT1 in the pathogenesis of Wilms' tumour, a tumour which accounts for 95% of all childhood renal tumours. In such cases, the WT1 gene acts as a tumour-suppressor gene. Subsequent research has shown that the WT1 gene in many other cases acts as an oncogene, most prominently in leukaemia and lung cancer (even though these cancer forms can emerge as a result of many other aetiological factors). Since WT1 acts as an oncogene in many different organs, it is of great importance to evaluate how and when the WT1 gene and protein act. This information can then be used to develop immunotherapy to stabilize and treat different malignant diseases. Both phase I and phase II studies have been carried out on candidate vaccines with varying but overall promising results. The immune response does not always correlate with the clinical response, however, and the efficacy of the treatment is often limited. Further development is, therefore, needed to understand how vaccines can be improved, so that they, can hopefully fulfil a clinical role in the future.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Lindstedt, Ingrid', 'Lindgren, Michelle Alexius', 'Andersson, Erika', 'Engstrom, Wilhelm']","['Lindstedt I', 'Lindgren MA', 'Andersson E', 'Engstrom W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['WT1', ""Wilms' tumour"", 'review', 'tumourigenesis', 'vaccine']",2014/09/06 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['28/5/675 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2014 Sep-Oct;28(5):675-81.,28,,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden wilhelm.engstrom@slu.se.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicated that SNS and EGCG caused a dose-dependent decline in the activity, transcription and translation of MMP-2 after treatment with SNS and EGCG, while AA was only able to inhibit the activity at maximum doses tested and to some extent, the protein expression levels of MMP-2, without affecting their transcriptional levels.

Reflecting upon what we have learnt from the chronic myeloid leukaemia field and for MF regarding disease complexity as well as individual patient factors including resistance we discuss why it is likely we will need several different agents with JAK inhibitory activity.

Primary human T cells can be modified using viral and non-viral vectors to promote the specific targeting of cancer cells via the introduction of exogenous T-cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). This gene transfer displays the potential to increase the specificity and potency of the anticancer response while decreasing the systemic adverse effects that arise from conventional treatments that target both cancerous and healthy cells. This review highlights the generation of clinical-grade T cells expressing CARs for immunotherapy, the use of these cells to target B-cell malignancies and, particularly, the first clinical trials deploying the Sleeping Beauty gene transfer system, which engineers T cells to target CD19+ leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",,"['Guerrero, Alan D', 'Moyes, Judy S', 'Cooper, Laurence J N']","['Guerrero AD', 'Moyes JS', 'Cooper LJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Chin J Cancer,Chinese journal of cancer,101498232,"['0 (CCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Neoplasms', 'Receptors, Antigen', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Receptors, CCR1', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', '*T-Lymphocytes']",,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cjc.014.10100 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.014.10100 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer. 2014 Sep;33(9):421-33. doi: 10.5732/cjc.014.10100.,33,10.5732/cjc.014.10100 [doi],"['Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ljncooper@mdanderson.org.']",PMC4190432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor effects of virosecurinine by inducing the apoptosis of leukemic K562 cells and to examine the underlying mechanisms. K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of virosecurinine (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 micromol/l) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The cell counting kit (CCK)8 method was used to detect the antitumor effect of K562 cells in vitro. Flow cytometry was used to observe the apoptotic ratio and analyze the cell cycle following treatment with virosecurinine in K562 cells. Light and electron microscopy was used to identify morphological alterations in the virosecurininetreated K562 cells. The mRNA levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), SH2 domaincontaining inositol5'phosphatase 2 (SHIP2), phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/Abelson (ABL) were detected pre and postvirosecurinine treatment using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). The generation depression effects of K562 cells cultured in vitro were detected using CCK8 technology, which revealed a dose and timedependent association. The IC50 was 32.984 micromol/l at 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that treatment with virosecurinine at concentrations of 6.25, 25 and 50 micromol/l increased the apoptotic rate of the K562 cells and caused G1/S phase arrest. RTqPCR indicated that virosecurinine upregulated the gene expression of PTEN and downregulated the expression of mTOR, SHIP2 and BCR/ABL in K562 cells.

However, after completion of Human Genome Project many scientists realized that sequence information alone was not sufficient to solve the biochemical mechanism of the organism through classical approaches. Non-coding parts of the genome produce small conserved ribonucleic acids, miRNAs to control cellular and physiological processes [1, 2]. This breakthrough discovery directed researches to examine role of miRNA in cancer since miRNAs are involved in the development, cell differentiation, and regulation of cell cycle [3]. The first paper of the special issue provides general information of miRNA in cancer research. This thematic issue presents two computational approaches for miRNA identification and their role in cancer. The first one comes from Dr. Wang and his presented work predicts cancer-related miRNAs by using expression profiles in tumor tissues. The work relies on R-squared method to investigate miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs from different tissues and predicts miRNAs associated with colon, prostate, pancreatic, lung, breast, bladder, and kidney cancer. The second paper by Allmer et al. examines miRNA-gene regulatory networks and their implications in cancer. Their work provides complex network of expression regulation and miRNAs' role in personalized medicine. miRNAs regulate tumor progression and metastasis by interacting with target genes in the cells. Exosomal shuttle small RNAs mediate cell to cell communication and regulate cancer metastasis. The regulation via heterotypic signals in the microenvironment was explained by Dr. Liang and Dr. Yu groups. The rest of the issue highlights the roles of miRNAs on multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer, urological malignancies, myeloid leukemia, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Proliferation of bone marrow of malignant plasma cells leads multiple myeloma and this accounts for ten percent of the hematological tumors. miRNAs biology in multiple myeloma and miRNA study methods was discussed by Dr. Cho's group along with translational therapeutics. Dr. Papavassiliou highlights recent literature on miRNA-colerectal cancer. miRNA in colorectal cancer regulates tumor specific markers and these markers have oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions as other types of cancer. The paper overviews miRNA biomarkers extracted from plasma and fecal samples and also explain novel therapeutic applications by miRNA delivery and inhibition. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non-small cell lung cancer shows poor prognosis and recurrence. Drug resistance limits current treatments and miRNA based gene therapy provides an alternative and attractive method for cancer inhibition since dysregulation of specific miRNAs involved in cancer cell resistance. Therefore, Dr. Giovannetti group explains current efforts in developing miRNA mimickers or antagomiRs for drug resistance mechanism. Dr. Ellinger and Dr. Muller present a comprehensive review on urological malignancies. The relationship between miRNAs and urological malignancies including prostate, renal cell carcinoma, testicular cancer, and bladder cancer and current literature were provided. The paper stimulates discussion on various bodily fluids and detectable miRNAs in patients' circulation. Thus, specific emphasis was given on circulating miRNAs and diagnostic-prognostic information. Last two papers of the issue provide roles of specific miRNAs in myeloid leukemia and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Dr. Vasconcelos showed that overexpression of miR-128 decreased acute myeloid leukemia cells and increased the DNA damage. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is the largest subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck. And Dr. Guo investigated regulation and expression of three miRNAs; miR-21, miR-106b and miR-375. The paper reported these miRNAs as potential biomarkers for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis. miRNAs involved in several metabolic pathways and their roles are yet to be elucidated. This thematic issue presents current efforts in determination of miRNAs at different cancer types. Each day determined miRNAs are deposited to the databases and scientists give a lot of effort to understand the biogenesis of these small molecules. These scientific studies and approaches are expected to improve current technologies for therapy and biomarker detection.",,"['Tutar, Yusuf']",['Tutar Y'],['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Introductory Journal Article']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CPB-62061 [pii]', '10.2174/138920101505140828161335 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2014;15(5):429. doi: 10.2174/138920101505140828161335.,15,,"['Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Pharmacy Division of Biochemistry 58140 Sivas, Turkey. ytutar@cumhuriyet.edu.tr.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a median of 202 (range: 139-251) potentially somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV) and 14 small indels (range: 7-22) with potentially protein-changing features per PCNSL. Mutations affected the B-cell receptor, toll-like receptor, and NF-kappaB and genes involved in chromatin structure and modifications, cell-cycle regulation, and immune recognition. A median of 22.2% (range: 20.0-24.7%) of somatic SNVs in 9 PCNSL overlaps with the RGYW motif targeted by somatic hypermutation (SHM); a median of 7.9% (range: 6.2-12.6%) affects its hotspot position suggesting a major impact of SHM on PCNSL pathogenesis. In addition to the well-known targets of aberrant SHM (aSHM) (PIM1), our data suggest new targets of aSHM (KLHL14, OSBPL10, and SUSD2).

APL is notorious for causing early death during induction therapy, resulting in induction failure. The aim of our study was to report the clinical characteristics, outcome and early induction deaths with regard to patients with APL seen at our hospital. METHODS: This was a retrospective study carried out at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. Patients aged > 15 years diagnosed with APL within the period September 2007-September 2012 were included in the study. RESULTS: Within the study period, 26 patients were diagnosed with APL based on morphology and the detection of t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1) and promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA). The male to female ratio was 1:1. The median age of the patients was 41 (range 16-72) years. In all, there were 13 (50.0%) high-risk patients, and early induction death rate was 61.5%. Causes of early induction deaths (n = 16) included haemorrhage in 7 (43.8%) patients, differentiation (ATRA) syndrome in 7 (43.8%) and infection in 2 (12.5%). The survival rate among patients who survived the early period was 70% at 42 months. The relapse rate was 30%. CONCLUSION: Early induction death rate was very high in patients with APL. The most common cause of early induction death in our study was haemorrhage. Outcome among patients with APL was found to be better among those who survived the initial period.",,"['Karim, Farheen', 'Shaikh, Usman', 'Adil, Salman Naseem', 'Khurshid, Mohammad']","['Karim F', 'Shaikh U', 'Adil SN', 'Khurshid M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/06 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/09/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11622/smedj.2014105 [doi]'],ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2014 Aug;55(8):443-7. doi: 10.11622/smedj.2014105.,55,,"['Section of Hematology, Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Stadium Road, Karachi 74800, Pakistan. farheen.mahar@aku.edu.']",PMC4294096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To study whether nystatin decreases morbidity and mortality when given prophylactically or therapeutically to patients with severe immunodeficiency. SEARCH METHODS: We searched PubMed from 1966 to 7 July 2014 and the reference lists of identified articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials comparing nystatin with placebo, an untreated control group, fluconazole or amphotericin B. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection and colonisation were independently extracted by both authors. A random-effects model was used unless the P value was greater than 0.10 for the test of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 trials (1569 patients). The drugs were given prophylactically in 12 trials and as treatment in two. Eleven trials were in acute leukaemia, solid cancer, or bone marrow recipients; one in liver transplant patients; one in critically ill surgical and trauma patients; and one in AIDS patients. Nystatin was compared with placebo in three trials, with fluconazole in 10, and amphotericin B in one; the dose varied from 0.8 MIE to 72 MIE daily and was 2 mg/kg/d in a liposomal formulation. The effect of nystatin was similar to that of placebo on fungal colonisation (relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.13). There was no statistically significant difference between fluconazole and nystatin on mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.03) whereas fluconazole was more effective in preventing invasive fungal infection (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93) and colonisation (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.68). There were no proven fungal infections in a small trial that compared amphotericin B with liposomal nystatin. The results were very similar if the three studies that were not performed in cancer patients were excluded. For the 2011 and 2014 updates no additional trials were identified for inclusion.

Here, we assess the role of these GSTs in relation to imatinib treatment outcome in 193 CML patients. Deletion of GSTT1 alone, or in combination with deletion of the GSTM1 gene, significantly increased the likelihood of imatinib failure (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001, respectively). The GSTP1*B SNP was not associated with time to imatinib failure. Losses of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes are therefore important determinants of imatinib failure in CML.

A well-informed decision on the use of anthracyclines in the treatment of childhood cancers should be based on evidence regarding both antitumour efficacy and cardiotoxicity. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To compare antitumour efficacy (survival and tumour response) and cardiotoxicity of treatment including or not including anthracyclines in children with childhood cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2013) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2013). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings, the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2002 to 2012) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (from 2002 to 2013). We have searched for ongoing trials in the ISRCTN register and the National Institute of Health register (both screened August 2013) (http://www.controlled-trials.com). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment of any type of childhood cancer with and without anthracyclines and reporting outcomes concerning antitumour efficacy or cardiotoxicity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MAIN RESULTS: We identified RCTs for seven types of tumour, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (three trials; 912 children), Wilms' tumour (one trial; 316 children), rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma (one trial; 413 children), Ewing's sarcoma (one trial; 94 children), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (one trial; 284 children), hepatoblastoma (one trial; 255 children) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (one trial; 394 children). All studies had methodological limitations. For ALL no evidence of a significant difference in antitumour efficacy was identified in the meta-analyses, but in most individual studies there was a suggestion of better antitumour efficacy in patients treated with anthracyclines. For both Wilms' tumour and Ewing's sarcoma a significant difference in event-free and overall survival in favour of treatment with anthracyclines was identified, although for Wilms' tumour the significant difference in overall survival disappeared with long-term follow-up. For rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and hepatoblastoma no difference in antitumour efficacy between the treatment groups was identified. The same was true for AML, with the exception of overall survival in a post hoc analysis in a subgroup of patients with relapsed core binding factor (CBF)-AML in which patients treated with anthracyclines did better. Clinical cardiotoxicity was evaluated in four RCTs; no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified, but in all individual studies there was a suggestion of a lower rate of clinical cardiotoxicity in patients who did not receive anthracyclines. None of the studies evaluated asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. No RCTs were identified for other childhood cancers. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At the moment no evidence from RCTs is available which underscores the use of anthracyclines in ALL. However, 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. For Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatoblastoma and AML only one RCT was available for each type and, therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours. For other childhood cancers no RCTs were identified and therefore no conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours.",,"['van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Raphael, Martine F', 'Caron, Huib N', 'Kremer, Leontien C M']","['van Dalen EC', 'Raphael MF', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hepatoblastoma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2015/10/03 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub4 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Sep 4;(9):CD006647. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub4.,,10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub4 [doi],"[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660 (room TKsO-247), Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1100 DD.""]",,,20140904,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(1):CD006647.

Despite results from randomized trials, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is not routinely included for GVHD prophylaxis in UD BMT by many centers. One of ways to demonstrate the usefulness of rabbit ATG in UD BMT is to evaluate how its results approximate to those observed in matched related (MRD) BMT. Therefore, we compared the outcomes between UD BMT with rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin) for GVHD prophylaxis (n = 25) and MRD BMT (n = 91) for leukemia and myelodysplasia. All but one patient received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Grades II-IV acute GVHD were similar (39.5% vs. 36%, p = 0.83); however, MRD BMT recipients developed more moderate-severe chronic GVHD (36.5% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.01) and GVHD-related deaths (32.5% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.04). UD BMT independently protected against chronic GVHD (hazard ratio 0.23, p = 0.04). The 6-month transplant-related mortality, 1-year relapse incidence, and 5-year survival rates were similar between patients with non-advanced disease in the MRD and UD BMT groups, 13.8% vs. 16.6% (p = 0.50), 20.8% vs. 16.6% (p = 0.37), and 57% vs. 50% (p = 0.67), respectively.

METHODS: We analyzed CCN1 protein expression in leukemia cell lines and in AML bone marrow samples. We also evaluated the effects of antibody- or siRNA-mediated inhibition of CCN1 on the growth of two AML cell lines (U937 and Kasumi-1 cells) and on the MEK/ERK pathway, beta-catenin and other related genes. RESULTS: U937 and Kasumi-1 cells had markedly higher CCN1 expression than the 5 other leukemia cell lines, and CCN1 protein expression was higher in the AML bone marrow samples than in the normal bone marrow samples. Blocking CCN1 with an antibody in U937 and Kasumi-1 cells suppressed proliferation, increased apoptosis, down-regulated Bcl-xL and c-Myc expression, up-regulated Bax expression, and had no effect on Survivin. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of CCN1 inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of U937 and Kasumi-1 cells and increased cytarabine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, CCN1 siRNA reduced MEK and ERK phosphorylation without affecting beta-catenin; the CCN1 antibody similarly affected MEK and ERK phosphorylation. These changes in phosphorylation could influence the expression of Bcl-xL, c-Myc and Bax in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggested that CCN1 is a tumor promoter in AML that acts through the MEK/ERK pathway to up-regulate c-Myc and Bcl-xL and to down-regulate Bax.",,"['Niu, Chang-Chun', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Yang, Zhong', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li', 'Pan, Jing', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Si, Wei-Ke']","['Niu CC', 'Zhao C', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang XL', 'Pan J', 'Zhao C', 'Si WK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CCN1', 'ERK']",2014/09/05 06:00,2014/09/05 06:01,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-014-0074-z [doi]', 's12935-014-0074-z [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2014 Aug 16;14:74. doi: 10.1186/s12935-014-0074-z. eCollection 2014.,14,10.1186/s12935-014-0074-z [doi],"[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China ; Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Third People's Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400042, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.']",PMC4153307,,20140816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focused on microRNAs (miRNAs), with the aim of finding a molecular biomarker to discriminate which patients can safely and successfully discontinue IM use. METHODS: To identify miRNAs that showed altered expression in patients who had discontinued IM (STOP-IM group), we first screened miRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by using a TaqMan miRNA array on samples from five unselected patients from the STOP-IM group, seven CML patients receiving IM (IM group), and five healthy volunteers. We then performed miRNA quantification in 49 CML patients with deep molecular response. Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests were used to determine statistical significance for comparisons between the control (healthy volunteers) and test groups (STOP-IM and IM groups). Multiple groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Downregulation of miR-148b was noted in patients in the STOP-IM group and in a subset of the IM group. We then subdivided the IM patients into two groups: one with downregulated miR-148b expression (IM-1; less than the cut-off value) and the other without downregulated miR-148b expression (IM-2; greater than the cut-off value). The number of patients who had a sustained stable molecular response was significantly lower in IM-2 group. This group also had a significantly lower percentage of natural killer cells.

However, the contribution of the latter unique nucleolar character to pluripotency has not been well understood. Here, we show that fibrillarin (FBL), a critical methyltransferase for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing in nucleoli, is one of the proteins highly expressed in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. Stable expression of FBL in ES cells prolonged the pluripotent state of mouse ES cells cultured in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Analyses using deletion mutants and a point mutant revealed that the methyltransferase activity of FBL regulates stem cell pluripotency. Knockdown of this gene led to significant delays in rRNA processing, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in mouse ES cells. Interestingly, both partial knockdown of FBL and treatment with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of rRNA synthesis, induced the expression of differentiation markers in the presence of LIF and promoted stem cell differentiation into neuronal lineages. Moreover, we identified p53 signaling as the regulatory pathway for pluripotency and differentiation of ES cells.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. Here, we report that honokiol effectively decreased enzyme activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and reduced the protein expression of class I HDACs in leukemic cells. Moreover, treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented honokiol-induced degradation of class I HDACs. Importantly, honokiol increased the levels of p21/waf1 and Bax via triggering acetylation of histone in the regions of p21/waf1 and Bax promoter. Honokiol induced apoptosis, decreased activity of HDACs, and significantly inhibited the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with AML. However, honokiol did not decrease the activity of HDACs and induce apoptosis in normal hematopoietic progenitors from unbilicial cord blood. Finally, honokiol dramatically reduced tumorigenicity in a xenograft leukemia model. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that honokiol has anti-leukemia activity through inhibiting HDACs. Thus, being a relative non-toxic agent, honokiol may serve as a novel natural agent for cancer prevention and therapy in leukemia.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Hai-Ying', 'Ye, Hai-Ge', 'Chen, Chi-Qi', 'Yin, Li-Hui', 'Wu, Jian-Bo', 'He, Li-Cai', 'Gao, Shen-Meng']","['Li HY', 'Ye HG', 'Chen CQ', 'Yin LH', 'Wu JB', 'He LC', 'Gao SM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biocatalysis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['BAX', 'HISTONE DEACETYLASES', 'HONOKIOL', 'P21/WAF1']",2014/09/05 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24967 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2015 Feb;116(2):287-98. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24967.,116,10.1002/jcb.24967 [doi],"['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 2 FuXue Road, Wenzhou, 325000, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of fucoxanthin against human bladder cancer T24 cell line. MTT analysis results showed that 5 and 10 muM fucoxanthin inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner accompanied by the growth arrest at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, which is mediated by the up-regulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitory protein and the down-regulation of CDK-2, CDK-4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E. In addition, 20 and 40 muM fucoxanthin induced apoptosis of T24 cells by the abrogation of mortalin-p53 complex and the reactivation of nuclear mutant-type p53, which also had tumor suppressor function as wild-type p53. All these results demonstrated that the anti-cancer activity of fucoxanthin on T24 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by up-regulation of p21 at low doses and apoptosis via decrease in the expression level of mortalin, which is a stress regulator and a member of heat shock protein 70, followed by up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 at high doses.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Direct targeting of RAS has proven to be challenging, although targeting of downstream RAS mediators, such as MEK, is currently being tested clinically. Given the complexity of RAS signaling, it is likely that combinations of targeted agents will be more effective than single agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A chemical screen using RAS-dependent leukemia cells was developed to identify compounds with unanticipated activity in the presence of an MEK inhibitor and led to identification of inhibitors of IGF1R. Results were validated using cell-based proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle, and gene knockdown assays; immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting; and a noninvasive in vivo bioluminescence model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Mechanistically, IGF1R protein expression/activity was substantially increased in mutant RAS-expressing cells, and suppression of RAS led to decreases in IGF1R. Synergy between MEK and IGF1R inhibitors correlated with induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell-cycle progression, and decreased phospho-S6 and phospho-4E-BP1. In vivo, NSG mice tail veins injected with OCI-AML3-luc+ cells showed significantly lower tumor burden following 1 week of daily oral administration of 50 mg/kg NVP-AEW541 (IGF1R inhibitor) combined with 25 mg/kg AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor), as compared with mice treated with either agent alone. Drug combination effects observed in cell-based assays were generalized to additional mutant RAS-positive neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that downstream inhibitors of RAS signaling and IGF1R inhibitors have synergistic activity warrants further clinical investigation of IGF1R and RAS signaling inhibition as a potential treatment strategy for RAS-driven malignancies.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Nonami, Atsushi', 'Chen, Zhao', 'Nelson, Erik', 'Chen, Yongfei', 'Liu, Feiyang', 'Cho, HaeYeon', 'Zhang, Jianming', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Mitsiades, Constantine', 'Wong, Kwok-Kin', 'Liu, Qingsong', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Nonami A', 'Chen Z', 'Nelson E', 'Chen Y', 'Liu F', 'Cho H', 'Zhang J', 'Sattler M', 'Mitsiades C', 'Wong KK', 'Liu Q', 'Gray NS', 'Griffin JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (NVP-AEW541)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2015/07/02 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-0902 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0902 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Nov 1;20(21):5483-95. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0902.

The effects of Sox2 and Klf4 on somatic cell reprogramming can be reproduced using the small molecule compounds, transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFbetaR) inhibitor and Kempaullone, respectively. Here we examined the effects of TGFbetaR inhibitor and Kempaullone on EGC derivation from PGCs. Treatment of PGCs with TGFbetaR inhibitor and/or Kempaullone generated pluripotent stem cells under standard embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture conditions without bFGF and SCF, which we termed induced EGCs (iEGCs). The derivation efficiency of iEGCs was dependent on the differentiation stage and sex. DNA methylation levels of imprinted genes in iEGCs were reduced, with the exception of the H19 gene. The promoters of genes involved in germline development were generally hypomethylated in PGCs, but three germline genes showed comparable DNA methylation levels among iEGs, ESCs, and iPSCs.

Recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy has entered clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 19-28z CAR T cells express a fusion protein comprised of an anti-CD19 mAb fused with CD28 costimulatory and CD3-zeta-chain signaling domains. The current paper demonstrates that administration of 19-28z CAR T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL in a Phase I clinical trial has led to 88% of patients undergoing complete remission. Despite the benefits, CAR T-cell therapy is associated with cytokine release syndrome toxicities. The authors demonstrated criteria to diagnose severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) and treated sCRS with either high-dose steroids or with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor-specific mAb. Although both alleviated sCRS, steroid treatment negated the beneficial effects of CAR T-cell therapy, whereas tocilizumab did not.

The structure reveals important differences compared with related RhoGEF proteins such as leukaemia-associated RhoGEF. Nucleotide-exchange assays comparing the activity of the DH-PH domain to the DH domain alone showed no role for the PH domain in nucleotide exchange, which is explained by the RhoA-AKAP-Lbc structure. Comparison with a structure of the isolated AKAP-Lbc DH domain revealed a change in conformation of the N-terminal 'GEF switch' region upon binding to RhoA.

In this study we compared the cytotoxicity, metabolism and the epigenetic changes induced by both drugs in leukemia cells. METHODS: Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Real-time PCR was used for gene expression analysis. DNA methylation was analyzed by DNA pyrosequencing. The metabolic stability was determined using human pooled liver microsomes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was used to quantify histone methylation. RESULTS: Clinically relevant concentration of curcumin and DMC were not cytotoxic to leukemia cells and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. DMC was more metabolically stable than curcumin. Curcumin and DMC were devoid of DNA hypomethylating activity. DMC induced the expression of promoter methylated genes without reversing DNA methylation and increased H3K36me3 mark near the promoter region of hypermethylated genes.

METHODS: Brain data sets came from a multicenter study (eight sites; three MR vendors). Data acquisition protocol required b=0, 700 s/mm2, fov=256x256 mm2, acquisition matrix size 128x128, reconstruction matrix size 256x256; 30 gradient encoding directions and voxel size 2x2x2 mm3. Regions-of-interest (ROI) were placed manually on the b=0 image volume on transverse slices, and signal was recorded as the mean value of the ROI. The noise level from the ROI was evaluated using Fourier Transform based Butterworth high-pass filtering. Patients were divided into two groups, one for filter parameter optimization (N=17) and one for validation (N=10). Six white matter areas (the genu and splenium of corpus callosum, right and left centrum semiovale, right and left anterior corona radiata) were analyzed. The Bland-Altman method was used to compare the resulting SNR with that from the difference image method. The filter parameters were optimized for each brain area, and a set of ""global"" parameters was also obtained, which represent an average of all regions. RESULTS: The Bland-Altman analysis on the validation group using ""global"" filter parameters revealed that the 95% limits of agreement of percent bias between the SNR obtained with the new and the reference methods were -15.5% (median of the lower limit, range [-24.1%, -8.9%]) and 14.5% (median of the higher limits, range [12.7%, 18.0%]) for the 6 brain areas. CONCLUSIONS: An FT-based high-pass filtering method can be used for local area SNR assessment using only one DTI data set. This method could be used to evaluate SNR for patient studies in a multicenter setting.",,"['Wang, Zhiyue J', 'Chia, Jonathan M', 'Ahmed, Shaheen', 'Rollins, Nancy K']","['Wang ZJ', 'Chia JM', 'Ahmed S', 'Rollins NK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Artifacts', 'Brain/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging/*methods', 'Female', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', '*Signal-To-Noise Ratio', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1118/1.4893195 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2014 Sep;41(9):092302. doi: 10.1118/1.4893195.,41,10.1118/1.4893195 [doi],"[""Department of Radiology, Children's Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235 and Department of Radiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390."", 'Clinical Science, Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, Ohio 44143.', ""Department of Radiology, Children's Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75235 and Department of Radiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390."", ""Department of Radiology, Children's Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75235 and Department of Radiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390.""]",PMC4141914,,,,,,,['AALL06N1/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Various military herbicides, including AO, were sprayed by the US military and allied forces for military purposes during the Vietnam War. This study was performed to identify the associations between the AO exposure and mortality in Korean Vietnam veterans. METHODS: From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2005, 180 639 Korean Vietnam veterans were followed up for vital status and cause of death. The AO exposure index was based on the proximity of the veteran's unit to AO-sprayed areas, using a geographical information system-based model. The adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by Cox's proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The mortality from all causes of death was elevated with AO exposure. The deaths due to all sites of cancers combined and some specific cancers, including cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, larynx, lung, bladder and thyroid gland, as well as chronic myeloid leukaemia, were positively associated with AO exposure. The deaths from angina pectoris, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver disease including liver cirrhosis were also increased with an increasing AO exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that AO/TCDD exposure may account for mortality from various diseases even several decades after exposure. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of AO/TCDD exposure on human health.","['(c) The Author 2014; all rights reserved.

IM resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, in many instances, there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance mechanisms, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen and identified IM-sensitizing genes (IMSGs) whose knockdown renders BCR-ABL(+) cells IM-resistant. In these IMSG knockdown cells, RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is sustained after IM treatment because of up-regulation of PRKCH, which encodes the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCeta, an activator of CRAF. PRKCH is also up-regulated in samples from CML patients with BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MEK inhibitor, synergistically kills BCR-ABL(+) IMSG knockdown cells and prolongs survival in mouse models of BCR-ABL-independent IM-resistant CML. Finally, we showed that CML stem cells contain high levels of PRKCH, and this contributes to their intrinsic IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib synergistically kills CML stem cells with negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our results identify a therapeutically targetable mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance in CML and CML stem cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Ma, Leyuan', 'Shan, Yi', 'Bai, Robert', 'Xue, Liting', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Ou, Jianhong', 'Zhu, Lihua J', 'Hutchinson, Lloyd', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Khoury, Hanna Jean', 'Sheng, Zhi', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Green, Michael R']","['Ma L', 'Shan Y', 'Bai R', 'Xue L', 'Eide CA', 'Ou J', 'Zhu LJ', 'Hutchinson L', 'Cerny J', 'Khoury HJ', 'Sheng Z', 'Druker BJ', 'Li S', 'Green MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (protein kinase C eta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'raf Kinases/metabolism']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['6/252/252ra121 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3009073 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2014 Sep 3;6(252):252ra121. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3009073.,6,10.1126/scitranslmed.3009073 [doi],"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Programs in Gene Function and Expression and Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Programs in Gene Function and Expression and Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Programs in Gene Function and Expression and Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Knight Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Programs in Gene Function and Expression and Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Programs in Gene Function and Expression and Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.

All three Runx isoforms are expressed at the earliest stages of hematopoiesis; however, their function in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is not fully elucidated. Here, we show that Runx factors are essential in HSCs by driving the expression of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. Mechanistically, by using a knockin mouse model in which all three Runx binding sites in the -14kb enhancer of PU.1 are disrupted, we observed failure to form chromosomal interactions between the PU.1 enhancer and its proximal promoter. Consequently, decreased PU.1 levels resulted in diminished long-term HSC function through HSC exhaustion, which could be rescued by reintroducing a PU.1 transgene. Similarly, in a mouse model of AML/ETO9a leukemia, disrupting the Runx binding sites resulted in decreased PU.1 levels. Leukemia onset was delayed, and limiting dilution transplantation experiments demonstrated functional loss of leukemia-initiating cells. This is surprising, because low PU.1 levels have been considered a hallmark of AML/ETO leukemia, as indicated in mouse models and as shown here in samples from leukemic patients.

HOXA9 plays a relevant role in leukemogenesis and hematopoiesis. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is downregulated upon differentiation. Hoxa9-deficient mice display impaired hematopoietic development, and deregulation of HOXA9 expression is frequently associated with acute leukemia. Analysis of the genes differentially expressed in cord blood HSPCs vs hESC-derived HSPCs identified HOXA9 as the most downregulated gene in hESC-derived HSPCs, suggesting that expression levels of HOXA9 may be crucial for hematopoietic differentiation of hESC. Here we show that during hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs, HOXA9 expression parallels hematopoietic development, but is restricted to the hemogenic precursors (HEP) (CD31(+)CD34(+)CD45(-)), and diminishes as HEPs differentiate into blood cells (CD45(+)). Different gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies reveal that HOXA9 enhances hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs by specifically promoting the commitment of HEPs into primitive and total CD45(+) blood cells. Gene expression analysis suggests that nuclear factor-kappaB signaling could be collaborating with HOXA9 to increase hematopoietic commitment. However, HOXA9 on its own is not sufficient to confer in vivo long-term engraftment potential to hESC-hematopoietic derivatives, reinforcing the idea that additional molecular regulators are needed for the generation of definitive in vivo functional HSPCs from hESC.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ramos-Mejia, Veronica', 'Navarro-Montero, Oscar', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Romero, Tamara', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Ramos-Mejia V', 'Navarro-Montero O', 'Ayllon V', 'Bueno C', 'Romero T', 'Real PJ', 'Menendez P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Silencing', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39655-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-558825 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 13;124(20):3065-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-558825.

The long latency preceding the development of the disease and the low incidence suggests that the virus itself is not sufficient for transformation and that genetic defects are required to create a permissive environment for leukemia. In fact, ATL cells are characterized by profound genetic modifications including structural and numerical chromosome alterations. RESULTS: In this study we used molecular combing techniques to study the effect of the oncoprotein Tax on DNA replication. We found that replication forks have difficulties replicating complex DNA, fork progression is slower, and they pause or stall more frequently in the presence of Tax expression. Our results also show that Tax-associated replication defects are partially compensated by an increase in the firing of back-up origins. Consistent with these effects of Tax on DNA replication, an increase in double strand DNA breaks (DDSB) was seen in Tax expressing cells. Tax-mediated increases in DDSBs were associated with the ability of Tax to activate NF-kB and to stimulate intracellular nitric oxide production. We also demonstrated a reduced expression of human translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases Pol-H and Pol-K in HTLV-I-transformed T cells and ATL cells. This was associated with an increase in DNA breaks induced by Tax at specific genome regions, such as the c-Myc and the Bcl-2 major breakpoints. Consistent with the notion that the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is hyperactive in HTLV-I-transformed cells, we found that inhibition of the NHEJ pathway induces significant killing of HTLV-I transformed cells and patient-derived leukemic ATL cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, replication problems increase genetic instability in HTLV-I-transformed cells. As a result, abuse of NHEJ and a defective homologous repair (HR) DNA repair pathway can be targeted as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia.",,"['Chaib-Mezrag, Hassiba', 'Lemacon, Delphine', 'Fontaine, Helene', 'Bellon, Marcia', 'Bai, Xue Tao', 'Drac, Marjorie', 'Coquelle, Arnaud', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Chaib-Mezrag H', 'Lemacon D', 'Fontaine H', 'Bellon M', 'Bai XT', 'Drac M', 'Coquelle A', 'Nicot C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*DNA Replication', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genome, Human', 'Genomic Instability', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2016/05/07 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-205 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-205 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Sep 4;13:205. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-205.,13,10.1186/1476-4598-13-205 [doi],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA. cnicot@kumc.edu.']",PMC4168069,,20140904,,,,,"['P30 GM103326/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Method:We undertook a review of the case records of the three patients and an electronic MEDLINE as well as a manual library search of existing pertinent literature. RESULT: Three male adults aged 55, 50 and 65 years old developed Diabetes Mellitus following the oral steroid administration. In the first case, oral Prednisolone (60mg/day) was used in combination to a cytotoxic agent Melphalan in the management of a plasma cell dyscrasia (Multiple Myeloma), the second case followed a one week course of same dose of prednisolone for Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia while the third case also had oral prednisolone administered alone for an Autoimmune Haemolytic anaemia. Aging, high body mass index and cumulative doses of steroids may be risk factors for the development of steroid-induced hyperglycaemia. The prevalence of this condition, possible pathogenesis and options for treatment are discussed. CONCLUSION: Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus is an important clinical finding that, if recognized early, can be effectively treated. We propose Fasting blood sugar and Oral glucose tolerance test as part of the pretreatment investigation during the evaluation as well as in the course of management of middle aged and elderly patients on steroids.",,"['Babadoko, A A', 'Ijei, I P', 'Bello-Manga, H', 'Hassan, A', 'Manu, M']","['Babadoko AA', 'Ijei IP', 'Bello-Manga H', 'Hassan A', 'Manu M']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Nigeria,Niger J Med,Nigerian journal of medicine : journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria,100888321,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*chemically induced', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",,,2014/09/05 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/09/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Niger J Med. 2014 Jul-Sep;23(3):267-70.,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Polycomb group (PcG) protein BMI1 is essential for the activity of both HSCs and progenitor cells. Although BMI1 operates by suppressing the Ink4a/Arf locus in progenitors and ST-HSCs, the mechanisms through which this gene regulates the activity of LT-HSCs remain poorly understood. Toward this goal, we isolated BMI1-containing protein complexes and identified UBAP2L as a novel BMI1-interacting protein. We also showed that UBAP2L is preferentially expressed in mouse and human HSC-enriched populations when compared with more mature cell types, and that this gene is essential for the activity of LT-HSCs. In contrast to what is observed for Bmi1 knockdown, we found that UBAP2L depletion does not affect the Ink4a/Arf locus. Given that we demonstrated that BMI1 overexpression is able to rescue the deleterious effects of Ubap2l downregulation on LT-HSC activity and that UBAP2L is part of a PcG subcomplex comprising BMI1, we propose a model in which at least 2 different BMI1-containing PcG complexes regulate HSC activity, which are distinguishable by the presence of UBAP2L.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bordeleau, Marie-Eve', 'Aucagne, Romain', 'Chagraoui, Jalila', 'Girard, Simon', 'Mayotte, Nadine', 'Bonneil, Eric', 'Thibault, Pierre', 'Pabst, Caroline', 'Bergeron, Anne', 'Barabe, Frederic', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Martin', 'Boutonnet, Christel', 'Meloche, Sylvain', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Bordeleau ME', 'Aucagne R', 'Chagraoui J', 'Girard S', 'Mayotte N', 'Bonneil E', 'Thibault P', 'Pabst C', 'Bergeron A', 'Barabe F', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau M', 'Boutonnet C', 'Meloche S', 'Sauvageau G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ubap2L protein, human)', '0 (Ubap2L protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Rnf2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",,,2014/09/04 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39709-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-01-548651 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Oct 9;124(15):2362-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-01-548651.

NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance is particularly important in the body's defense against hematological malignancies such as leukemia. STAT3 inhibitors are currently being developed, although their potential effects on NK cells are not clear. We have investigated the function of STAT3 in NK cells with Stat3(Delta/Delta)Ncr1-iCreTg mice, whose NK cells lack STAT3. In the absence of STAT3, NK cells develop normally and in normal numbers, but display alterations in the kinetics of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. We report that STAT3 directly binds the IFN-gamma promoter. In various in vivo models of hematological diseases, loss of STAT3 in NK cells enhances tumor surveillance. The reduced tumor burden is paralleled by increased expression of the activating receptor DNAM-1 and the lytic enzymes perforin and granzyme B.

B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) is a member of the CBM signalosome, which links Ang II and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. We hypothesized that Bcl10 is pivotal in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced cardiac damage. Ang II infusion in mice lacking Bcl10 resulted in reduced cardiac fibrosis, less cellular infiltration, and improved arrhythmogenic electric remodeling, despite a similar degree of hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow (BM), whereby Bcl10 knockout or wildtype BM was transferred to their opposite genotype recipients, revealed the dual importance of Bcl10 within both cardiac and immune cells. Loss of Bcl10 in cardiac cells resulted in reduced expression of genes important for the adhesion and recruitment of immune cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that adhesion of monocytes to Ang II-treated endothelial cells also required Bcl10. Additionally, Bcl10 deficiency in macrophages reduced their intrinsic migratory ability. To address the role of BM-derived fibroblasts in the formation of cardiac fibrosis, we explored whether Bcl10 is also important for the infiltration of BM-derived (myo)fibroblasts into the heart. The transfer of green fluorescent protein positive wildtype BM into Bcl10 knockout recipient mice revealed a reduced number of noncardiac (myo)fibroblasts compared with those wildtype recipients. Our results demonstrate the significant role of Bcl10 in multiple cell types important for the generation of Ang II-induced cardiac damage and electric remodeling and may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.","['(c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.']","['Marko, Lajos', 'Henke, Norbert', 'Park, Joon-Keun', 'Spallek, Bastian', 'Qadri, Fatimunnisa', 'Balogh, Andras', 'Apel, Ingrid J', 'Oravecz-Wilson, Katherine I', 'Choi, Mira', 'Przybyl, Lukasz', 'Binger, Katrina J', 'Haase, Nadine', 'Wilck, Nicola', 'Heuser, Arnd', 'Fokuhl, Verena', 'Ruland, Jurgen', 'Lucas, Peter C', 'McAllister-Lucas, Linda M', 'Luft, Friedrich C', 'Dechend, Ralf', 'Muller, Dominik N']","['Marko L', 'Henke N', 'Park JK', 'Spallek B', 'Qadri F', 'Balogh A', 'Apel IJ', 'Oravecz-Wilson KI', 'Choi M', 'Przybyl L', 'Binger KJ', 'Haase N', 'Wilck N', 'Heuser A', 'Fokuhl V', 'Ruland J', 'Lucas PC', 'McAllister-Lucas LM', 'Luft FC', 'Dechend R', 'Muller DN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Angiotensin II/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Atrial Remodeling/*physiology', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Fibrosis', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl10', 'angiotensin II', 'cardiac arrhythmia', 'fibrosis', 'immune system']",2014/09/04 06:00,2015/01/17 06:00,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03900 [pii]', '10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03900 [doi]']",ppublish,Hypertension. 2014 Nov;64(5):1032-9. doi: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03900.

The ability to use DIMS as a filter for known analytes makes DIMS coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (DIMS-MS/MS) a promising technique for the detection of cancer antigens that can be predicted by computational algorithms. In experiments using DIMS-MS/MS that were performed without the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a predicted model antigen, GLR (FLSSANEHL), was detected at a concentration of 10 pM (20 amol) in a mixture containing 94 competing model peptide antigens, each at a concentration of 1 muM. Without DIMS filtering, the GLR peptide was undetectable in the mixture even at 100 nM. Again, without using HPLC, DIMS-MS/MS was used to detect 2 of 3 previously characterized antigens produced by the leukemia cell line U937.A2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SYMPTOMS: Dyspnea * fatigue. MEDICATION: Idarubicin followed by cytarabine. CLINICAL PROCEDURE: Chemotherapy. SPECIALTY: Hematology. OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course. BACKGROUND: Renal failure is a common presentation of acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemia. It is usually the result of a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction and is associated with a poor prognosis. No guidelines exist for treatment. CASE REPORT: We herein describe the case of a 78-year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute myeloid leukemia M5, leukostasis with a white count of 340 000/ml, and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7.7/dL. The patient was initially treated with leukapheresis and 3 days of idarubicin in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy that resulted in rapid reversal of his renal failure. He then received 7 days of continuous infusion cytarabine and went into a complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: Renal failure may complicate the presentation of AML but can be reversible with treatment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, as indicated in our case report. In addition, we emphasize that organ dysfunction, even in elderly patients, is not necessarily a contraindication to aggressive treatment if it is felt to be disease-related and reversible.",,"['Tapper, Elliot B', 'Luptakova, Katarina', 'Joyce, Robin M', 'Tzachanis, Dimitrios']","['Tapper EB', 'Luptakova K', 'Joyce RM', 'Tzachanis D']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Renal Dialysis/methods']",,,2014/09/04 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['890798 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.890798 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2014 Aug 30;15:364-7. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.890798.,15,10.12659/AJCR.890798 [doi],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, USA.']",PMC4159241,,20140830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CITED2 overexpression in normal CD34(+) cells resulted in enhanced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) output in vitro, as well as in better hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftability in NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice. This was because of an enhanced quiescence and maintenance of CD34(+)CD38(-) HSCs, due in part to an increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A. We demonstrated that PU.1 is a critical regulator of CITED2, as PU.1 repressed CITED2 expression in a DNA methyltransferase 3A/B (DNMT3A/B)-dependent manner in normal CD34(+) cells. CD34(+) cells from a subset of AML patients displayed higher expression levels of CITED2 as compared with normal CD34(+) HSPCs, and knockdown of CITED2 in AML CD34(+) cells led to a loss of long-term expansion, both in vitro and in vivo. The higher CITED2 expression resulted from reduced PU.1 activity and/or dysfunction of mutated DNMT3A/B. Collectively, our data demonstrate that increased CITED2 expression results in better HSC maintenance. In concert with low PU.1 levels, this could result in a perturbed myeloid differentiation program that contributes to leukemia maintenance.",,"['Korthuis, P M', 'Berger, G', 'Bakker, B', 'Rozenveld-Geugien, M', 'Jaques, J', 'de Haan, G', 'Schuringa, J J', 'Vellenga, E', 'Schepers, H']","['Korthuis PM', 'Berger G', 'Bakker B', 'Rozenveld-Geugien M', 'Jaques J', 'de Haan G', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Vellenga E', 'Schepers H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CITED2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2014/09/04 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014259 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.259 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):625-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.259.

The peptide was evaluated for generating cyclic peptide-capped selenium nanoparticles (CP-SeNPs) in situ. A physical mixing of the cyclic peptide with SeO3(-2) solution in water generated [W5R4C]-SeNPs via the combination of reducing and capping properties of amino acids in the peptide structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that [W5R4C]-SeNPs were in the size range of 110-150 nm. Flow cytometry data revealed that a fluorescence-labeled phosphopeptide (F'-PEpYLGLD, where F' = fluorescein) and an anticancer drug (F'-dasatinib) exhibited approximately 25- and 9-times higher cellular uptake in the presence of [W5R4C]-SeNPs than those of F'-PEpYLGLD and dasatinib alone in human leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cells after 2 h of incubation, respectively. Confocal microscopy also exhibited higher cellular delivery of F'-PEpYLGLD and F'-dasatinib in the presence of [W5R4C]-SeNPs compared to the parent fluorescence-labeled drug alone in human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3) cells after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees C.

Here, we modeled staphylococcal BSI in leukopenic CD-1 mice that had been treated with cyclophosphamide, a drug for leukemia and lymphoma patients. Cyclophosphamide-treated mice were highly sensitive to S. aureus BSI and developed infectious lesions lacking immune cell infiltrates. Virulence factors of S. aureus that are key for disease establishment in immunocompetent hosts-alpha-hemolysin (Hla), iron-regulated surface determinants (IsdA and IsdB), coagulase (Coa), and von Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp)-are dispensable for the pathogenesis of BSI in leukopenic mice.

Cobalt ions activate human toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which normally responds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in sepsis. Activation of TLR4 by LPS increases the expression of chemokines IL-8 and CXCL10, which recruit leukocytes and activated T-cells, respectively. This study was designed to determine whether cobalt induces a similar inflammatory response to LPS by promoting the expression of IL-8 and CXCL10. A human monocytic cell line, derived from acute monocytic leukaemia, was treated with cobalt ions and expression of IL-8 and CXCL10 measured at mRNA and protein levels. Cobalt-treated macrophages showed a 60-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA, and an eightfold increase in production of the mature chemokine (both p < 0.001); expression of the CXCL10 gene and protein was also significantly increased by cobalt (both p < 0.001). Experiments were also performed in the presence of CLI-095, a TLR4-specific antagonist which abrogated the cobalt-mediated increase in IL-8 and CXCL10 expression. These findings suggest that cobalt ions induce inflammation similar to that observed during sepsis by the simultaneous activation of two TLR4-mediated signalling pathways. These pathways result in increased production of IL-8 and CXCL10, and may be implicated in pseudotumour formation following metal-on-metal replacement.",['(c)2014 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.'],"['Lawrence, H', 'Deehan, D', 'Holland, J', 'Kirby, J', 'Tyson-Capper, A']","['Lawrence H', 'Deehan D', 'Holland J', 'Kirby J', 'Tyson-Capper A']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Joint J,The bone & joint journal,101599229,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL10 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL10/metabolism', 'Cobalt/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granuloma, Plasma Cell/*etiology/immunology', 'Hip Prosthesis/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Joint Diseases/*etiology/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses/*adverse effects', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL10', 'Cobalt', 'Hip replacement', 'IL-8', 'Metal-on-metal', 'TLR4']",2014/09/04 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['96-B/9/1172 [pii]', '10.1302/0301-620X.96B9.33476 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Joint J. 2014 Sep;96-B(9):1172-7. doi: 10.1302/0301-620X.96B9.33476.,96-B,10.1302/0301-620X.96B9.33476 [doi],"['Newcastle University, Institute of Cellular Medicine, 3rd Floor, William Leech Building, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Freeman Hospital, Department of Orthopaedics, Freeman Hospital, Freeman Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.', 'Freeman Hospital, Department of Orthopaedics, Freeman Hospital, Freeman Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, UK.', 'Newcastle University, Institute of Cellular Medicine, 3rd Floor, William Leech Building, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Newcastle University, Institute of Cellular Medicine, 3rd Floor, William Leech Building, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this aim, we first analyzed a selected cohort of 185 patients with (n = 138) or without (n = 47) FLT3-ITD by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis for 13q LOH. In 46 of 138 FLT3-ITD positive cases, a FLT3-ITD/FLT3wt ratio of >/= 1 was measured indicating LOH. Applying analysis with a combination of five different STR markers, a threshold of an STR allelic ratio of >65% allows the identification of LOH in 40/46 (87%) samples. Survival analysis revealed significantly inferior outcome in patients with LOH as detected by STR analysis (event free survival (EFS): no LOH: 13.3 months versus LOH: 4.5 months, p < 0.001; overall survival (OS): no LOH: 35.8 months versus LOH: 9.7 months, p = 0.001). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, 13q LOH was found to be an independent adverse parameter for EFS and OS (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively) besides age and white blood cell count. Thus, the prognostic impact of 13q LOH is nearly identical to the one of FLT3-ITD/FLT3wt load of >/= 1 and thus is a feasible alternative to identify respective patients with high risk AML. In a second approach, a cohort of 91 patients was subjected to a proof-of-principle study of applying single nucleotide polymorphism analysis by next generation amplicon sequencing for detection of LOH. 53/91 cases had LOH and 50 were identified with this new method resulting in a positive detection rate of 94.3%.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2014/09/04 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22210 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Dec;53(12):1008-17. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22210.

We report a case of 39-years-old male of primary splenic NK/T cell lymphoma with bone marrow involvement and CD30 positive expression. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient had high fever for 2 months, and CT scan revealed a diffuse splenomegaly without hepatomegaly. The diagnosis was established by splenectomy specimen and bone marrow biopsy. Normal spleen structure was destroyed by the diffusely infiltrated neoplastic cells, and one of the splenic hilar lymph nodes was involved. The lymphomatous cells were mainly medium-sized, mixed with small and large cells with pleomorphic nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli. Angiocentric growth pattern was present, with mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies easily being found. These neoplastic cells demonstrated a typical immunophenotype of CD2, CD3epsilon, CD7, CD4, CD56, TIA-1, Granzyme B, CD30 positive, and CD5, CD8, CD20, CD79a negative. The Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNAs (EBERs) genomes were also found in tumor cells by in situ hybridization, while no clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor-gamma genes (TCRG) was found. Biopsy of bone marrow revealed scattered atypical cells presented with a predominantly intrasinusoidal distribution. A diagnosis as primary spleen NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) with CD30 expression and bone marrow involvement was finally made. The patient received chemotherapy and was still alive 6 months after splenectomy. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Primary spleen ENKTL is very rare, it should be made with the combination of clinical feature, PET-CT image, and pathological characteristics, and should be distinguished from other lymphomas or leukemia involved in spleen.

METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial activities of ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate (EtAc), n-hexane and water extracts of Thermopsis turcica herb against periodontopathogenic bacteria, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29523 and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 were tested by agar well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Antioxidant properties of the extracts were evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical scavenging activity and beta-carotene bleaching methods. Amounts of phenolic contents of the extracts were also analysed by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Additionally, cytotoxic activity of the extracts on androgen-insensitive prostate cancer, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer, chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia human cancer cell lines were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Human gingival fibroblast cells were used as a control. RESULTS: Our data showed that EtAc extract had the highest antimicrobial effect on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (MIC: 1.562 mg/mL, MBC: 3.124 mg/mL) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (MIC: 0.781 mg/mL, MBC: 1.562 mg/mL). In antioxidant assays, EtAc extract exhibited also the highest radical scavenging activity [IC50=(30.0+/-0.3) microg/mL] and the highest inhibition [(74.35+/-0.30)%] against lineloic acide oxidation. The amount of phenolic content of it was also the highest [(162.5+/-1.2) microg/mg gallic acid]. In cytotoxic assay, only ethanol [IC50=(80.00+/-1.21) microg/mL] and EtAc extract [IC50=(70.0+/-0.9) microg/mL] were toxic on acute promyelocytic leukemia cells at 20-100 microg/mL (P<0.05).

OBJECTIVE: this study aimed to verify the frequency of rhinosinusitis after HSCT, and the association between rhinosinusitis and chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and type of transplantation, clinical treatment, surgical treatment, and survival. METHODS: this was a retrospective study in a tertiary university hospital. A total of 95 patients with hematological diseases undergoing HSCT between 1996 and 2011 were selected. RESULTS: chronic myeloid leukemia was the most prevalent disease. The type of transplant most often performed was the allogenic type (85.26%). The frequency of rhinosinusitis was 36%, with no difference between the autologous and the allogenic types. Chronic GVHD occurred in 30% of patients. Patients with GVHD had a higher frequency and recurrence of rhinosinusitis, in addition to more frequent need for endoscopic sinusectomy and decreased overall survival. CONCLUSION: there was a higher frequency of rhinosinusitis in HSCT and GVHD. The type of transplant does not appear to predispose to the occurrence of rhinosinusitis. GVHD seems to be an aggravating factor and requires a more stringent treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia', 'Cervico-Facial.

The expression patterns of chemokines and chemokine receptors are specific to certain organs and cells. Therefore, chemokines are important to elucidate the mechanism of organ-specific human diseases. CCL17 expressed by Langerhans cells, blood endothelial cells, and fibroblasts plays a key role in attracting Th2 cells and tumor cells of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome into the skin, developing various Th2-type inflammatory skin diseases as well as cutaneous lymphoma. CCL11 and CCL26 expressed by skin-resident cells, such as fibroblasts, blood endothelial cells, and keratinocytes, induce infiltration of CCR3-expressing cells such as Th2 cells and eosinophils. CCL11 may also serve as an autocrine as well as a paracrine in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. CX3CL1 expressed on blood endothelial cells leads to infiltration of CX3CR1(+) immune cells, such as mast cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, playing important roles in wound healing, tumor immunity, and vasculitis.

We investigated the impact of hypoalbuminemia (<35 g/liter) on voriconazole pharmacokinetics in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated with voriconazole (20 samples in 13 patients) as well as in plasma samples from ICU patients that had been spiked with voriconazole at concentrations of 1.5 mg/liter, 2.9 mg/liter, and 9.0 mg/liter (66 samples from 22 patients). Plasma albumin concentrations ranged from 13.8 to 38.7 g/liter. Total voriconazole concentrations in adult ICU patients treated with voriconazole ranged from 0.5 to 8.7 mg/liter. Unbound and bound voriconazole concentrations were separated using high-throughput equilibrium dialysis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS). Multivariate analysis revealed a positive relationship between voriconazole plasma protein binding and plasma albumin concentrations (P < 0.001), indicating higher unbound voriconazole concentrations with decreasing albumin concentrations. The correlation is more pronounced in the presence of elevated bilirubin concentrations (P = 0.05). We therefore propose to adjust the measured total voriconazole concentrations in patients with abnormal plasma albumin and total serum bilirubin plasma concentrations who show adverse events potentially related to voriconazole via a formula that we developed. Assuming 50% protein binding on average and an upper limit of 5.5 mg/liter for total voriconazole concentrations, the upper limit for unbound voriconazole concentrations is 2.75 mg/liter. Alterations in voriconazole unbound concentrations caused by hypoalbuminemia and/or elevated bilirubin plasma concentrations cannot be countered immediately, due to the adult saturated hepatic metabolism. Consequently, increased unbound voriconazole concentrations can possibly cause adverse events, even when total voriconazole concentrations are within the reference range.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

G.E. Schatz & Lowry (Ebenaceae). METHODS: An ethno-botanical survey was conducted in the south of Madagascar from July to August 2010. Bio-guided fractionation assay was carried out on the root bark of Diospyros quercina, using cytotoxicity bioassay on murine P388 leukemia cell lines as model. The structures of the cytotoxic compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Biological experiments resulted in the isolation of three bioactive pure compounds (named TR-21, TR-22, and TR-23) which exhibited very good in vitro cytotoxic activities with the IC50 values of (0.017 5+/-0.0060) microg/mL, (0.089+/-0.005) microg/mL and (1.027+/-0.070) microg/mL respectively. Thus, they support the claims of traditional healers and suggest the possible correlation between the chemical composition of this plant and its wide use in Malagasy folk medicine to treat cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of isolated compounds in this study to inhibit cell growth may represent a rational explanation for the use of Diospyros quercina root bark in treating cancer by Malagasy traditional healers. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to evaluate the in vivo anti-neoplastic activity of these cytotoxic compounds as effective anticancer drugs.",,"['Ruphin, Fatiany Pierre', 'Baholy, Robijaona', 'Emmanuel, Randrianarivo', 'Amelie, Raharisololalao', 'Martin, Marie-Therese', 'Koto-Te-Nyiwa, Ngbolua']","['Ruphin FP', 'Baholy R', 'Emmanuel R', 'Amelie R', 'Martin MT', 'Koto-Te-Nyiwa N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Asian Pac J Trop Biomed,Asian Pacific journal of tropical biomedicine,101557706,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['(E)-5,6-Dimethyl-2-(2-methyl-3-(prop-1-enyl) phenyl)-2H-Chromene', ""3'-dihydroxy-4"", ""6-dimethyl-1,2'-binaphthyl-2,5',8,8'tetraones"", ""6'-Ethoxy-1'"", 'Cytotoxic activities', 'Diospyros quercinia', 'Isodiospyrin', 'Madagascar']",2014/09/04 06:00,2014/09/04 06:01,['2014/09/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60227-6 [doi]', 'apjtb-04-03-169 [pii]']",ppublish,Asian Pac J Trop Biomed. 2014 Mar;4(3):169-75. doi: 10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60227-6.,4,10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60227-6 [doi],"['Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, P.O.

Nearly 100 experts and researchers in retroviruses other than HIV1, the classical AIDS agent, convened for a oneday meeting devoted to updating knowledge on the epidemiology of HIV2 and HTLV-1 infections and discussing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, with special attention to nonendemic regions such as Spain. The Group was funded 25 years ago and since then has been responsible for the national registry of cases, recording all relevant information for each subject and inviting them to enroll in a prospective cohort and biobank. Up to the end of 2013, a total of 297 individuals with HIV2 infection were reported in Spain. All but 10 carry HIV2 subtype A, with the rest being infected with subtype B. Overall, 71% came from subSaharan Africa. During the last decade, the incidence of new HIV2 infections in Spain has remained fairly stable with around 20 cases per year. At the time of diagnosis, plasma HIV2 RNA was undetectable in 61% of individuals and values in viremic subjects tended to be low (2.8 logs on average). To date, only 26% of HIV2 individuals have been treated with antiretrovirals. The CD4 counts, however, only increased above 200 cells/mm(3) in 42% of them. On the other hand, 74% of nontreated HIV2 individuals have > 500 CD4+ Tcells/mm(3). As in HIV1 infection, X4 tropism in HIV2 is associated with lower CD4 counts. A total of 253 individuals with HTLV-1 infection were reported in Spain by the end of 2013. Overall, 58% came from Latin America. HTLV-1associated myelopathy was diagnosed in 29 patients and adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma in 18. The highest incidence occurred in 2013, with 34 new HTLV-1 diagnoses, largely as result of expanding HTLV screening in blood banks.

E2F1-3 and MYC are important transcription factors that form positive feedback loops by reciprocal regulation in their own transcription processes. Since genes regulated by E2F1-3 or MYC are related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, we wonder if there exists difference in the coexpression patterns of genes regulated concurrently by E2F1-3 and MYC between the normal and the CML states. RESULTS: We proposed a method to explore the difference in the coexpression patterns of those candidate target genes between the normal and the CML groups. A disease-specific cutoff point for coexpression levels that classified the coexpressed gene pairs into strong and weak coexpression classes was identified. Our developed method effectively identified the coexpression pattern differences from the overall structure. Moreover, we found that genes related to the cell adhesion and angiogenesis properties were more likely to be coexpressed in the normal group when compared to the CML group. CONCLUSION: Our findings may be helpful in exploring the underlying mechanisms of CML and provide useful information in cancer treatment.",,"['Wang, Fengfeng', 'Chan, Lawrence W C', 'Cho, William C S', 'Tang, Petrus', 'Yu, Jun', 'Shyu, Chi-Ren', 'Tsui, Nancy B Y', 'Wong, S C Cesar', 'Siu, Parco M', 'Yip, S P', 'Yung, Benjamin Y M']","['Wang F', 'Chan LW', 'Cho WC', 'Tang P', 'Yu J', 'Shyu CR', 'Tsui NB', 'Wong SC', 'Siu PM', 'Yip SP', 'Yung BY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (E2F3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F3 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'E2F3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism']",,,2014/09/03 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/09/03 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/439840 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:439840. doi: 10.1155/2014/439840.

However, treatment-related morbidity limits the patient generalizability of HSCT use, and the survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) within protective areas of the bone marrow (BM) continues to lead to high relapse rates. Despite growing appreciation for the significance of the LSC microenvironment, it has remained unresolved whether LSCs preferentially situate within normal HSC niches or whether their niche requirements are more promiscuous. Here, we provide functional evidence that the spatial localization of phenotypically primitive human AML cells is restricted to niche elements shared with their normal counterparts, and that their intrinsic ability to initiate and retain occupancy of these niches can be rivaled by healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). When challenged in competitive BM repopulation assays, primary human leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs) can be consistently outperformed by HSPCs for BM niche occupancy in a cell dose-dependent manner that ultimately compromises long-term L-IC renewal and subsequent leukemia-initiating capacity.

However, the great majority of existing cancer classification methods are clinical-based and have relatively weak diagnostic ability. With the rapid development of gene expression technology, it is able to classify different kinds of cancers using DNA microarray. Our main idea is to confront the problem of cancer classification using gene expression data from a graph-based view. Based on a new node influence model we proposed, this paper presents a novel high accuracy method for cancer classification, which is composed of four parts: the first is to calculate the similarity matrix of all samples, the second is to compute the node influence of training samples, the third is to obtain the similarity between every test sample and each class using weighted sum of node influence and similarity matrix, and the last is to classify each test sample based on its similarity between every class. The data sets used in our experiments are breast cancer, central nervous system, colon tumor, prostate cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and lung cancer. experimental results showed that our node influence based method (NIM) is more efficient and robust than the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, C4.5, naive Bayes, and CART.",,"['Wang, Yiwen', 'Yao, Min', 'Yang, Jianhua']","['Wang Y', 'Yao M', 'Yang J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Comput Math Methods Med,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,101277751,,IM,"['Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,2014/09/03 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/09/03 06:00'],"['2014/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/826373 [doi]'],ppublish,Comput Math Methods Med. 2014;2014:826373. doi: 10.1155/2014/826373.

Recent advances have renewed the interest in exploiting the antileukemic activity of interferon (IFN)alpha for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we identify a novel synergistic interaction of the Smac mimetic BV6 and IFNalpha to trigger cell death in AML cells. Calculation of combination index (CI) confirms the synergism of BV6 and IFNalpha. In contrast to AML cells, no synergistic toxicity of BV6 and IFNalpha at equimolar concentrations is found against normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. BV6 and IFNalpha act in concert to stimulate expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and its secretion into the supernatant, thereby initiating an autocrine/paracrine TNFalpha/TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) loop that drives cell death by BV6 and IFNalpha. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of TNFalpha by the TNFalpha-blocking antibody Enbrel or genetic silencing of TNFR1 significantly reduces BV6/IFNalpha-induced cell death. In addition, BV6/IFNalpha-induced cell death depends on interferon regulatory factor (IRF)1, since RNA interference-imposed knockdown of IRF1 significantly rescues cell death. In conclusion, the identification of a novel synergistic antileukemic combination of Smac mimetic and IFNalpha has important implications for the development of innovative treatment strategies in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We examined immunohistochemical expression of Bcl-2 in 492 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using tissue microarrays and investigated its correlation with clinicopathologic features and clinical outcome. A total of 47 (9.5 %) TNBCs showed Bcl-2 expression. Bcl-2 expression was not associated with any of the clinicopathologic parameters and did not affect patient survival in TNBCs (Bcl-2-positive vs Bcl-2-negative TNBCs; overall survival (OS), P = 0.258; disease-free survival (DFS), P = 0.436). When TNBCs were divided into basal (cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6)+ and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)+) and non-basal (CK5/6- and EGFR-) subgroups, Bcl-2 expression showed a significant association with worse OS (P = 0.002) and DFS (P = 0.002) in the non-basal subgroup. Among patients treated with an anthracycline, Bcl-2 expression also showed an association with decreased survival (OS, P = 0.004; DFS, P = 0.003) in the non-basal subgroup. In multivariate analyses, Bcl-2 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS (P = 0.003) and DFS (P = 0.002) in this subgroup of TNBCs. Our results suggest that positive expression of Bcl-2 predicts no benefit from adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in non-basal TNBC patients. In conclusion, Bcl-2 status showed both prognostic and predictive values in non-basal TNBCs; therefore, assessment of Bcl-2 status and basal phenotype can provide information on prognostic and therapeutic classifications of TNBCs.",,"['Choi, Jung Eun', 'Kang, Su Hwan', 'Lee, Soo Jung', 'Bae, Young Kyung']","['Choi JE', 'Kang SH', 'Lee SJ', 'Bae YK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Tumor Burden']",,,2014/09/03 06:00,2015/03/11 06:00,['2014/09/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2534-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Dec;35(12):12255-63. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2534-4.

We have shown that endothelial cells (ECs) provide a fertile niche that allows for the propagation of primitive and aggressive leukemic clones. Activation of the ECs by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A provides cues that enable leukemic cells to proliferate at higher rates and also increases the adhesion of leukemia to ECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor A-activated ECs decrease the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents to target leukemic cells. Inhibiting VEGF-dependent activation of ECs by blocking their signaling through VEGF receptor 2 increases the susceptibility of leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, the development of drugs that target the activation state of the vascular niche could prove to be an effective adjuvant therapy in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To identify potential drug resistance mechanisms in MM we used iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) mass spectrometry to compare protein expression profiles of drug-resistant (RPMI 8226-R5) and sensitive (RPMI 8226-S) isogenic cell lines. We identified selective overexpression of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) in drug-resistant R5 cells. MARCKS overexpression was also observed in several drug-resistant human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and in drug-resistant primary MM samples. Functionally, inhibition of MARCKS phosphorylation by enzastaurin or knockdown of the gene by RNAi significantly enhanced the sensitivity of resistant HMCLs and primary MM samples to bortezomib and to other anti-myeloma drugs, providing evidence that MARCKS can modulate drug response. Mechanistically, pMARCKS (phosphorylated form of MARCKS) was found to function as an E2F-1 cofactor to regulate SKP2 transcription. pMARCKS promoted cell-cycle progression by facilitating SKP2 expression, suppressing p27(Kip1) and potentially counteracting drug-induced cell-cycle arrest by promoting Cyclin E/CDK2 activity.

Here, we identify FHL2 as a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that is essential for maintaining HSC self-renewal under regenerative stress. We find that Fhl2 loss has limited effects on hematopoiesis under homeostatic conditions. In contrast, Fhl2-null chimeric mice reconstituted with Fhl2-null bone marrow cells developed abnormal hematopoiesis with significantly reduced numbers of HSCs, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), red blood cells and platelets as well as hemoglobin levels. In addition, HSCs displayed a significantly reduced self-renewal capacity and were skewed toward myeloid lineage differentiation. We find that Fhl2 loss reduces both HSC quiescence and survival in response to regenerative stress, probably as a consequence of Fhl2-loss-mediated downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitors, including p21(Cip) and p27(Kip1). Interestingly, FHL2 is regulated under the control of a tissue-specific promoter in hematopoietic cells and it is downregulated by DNA hypermethylation in the leukemia cell line and primary leukemia cells. Furthermore, we find that downregulation of FHL2 frequently occurs in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia patients, raising a possibility that FHL2 downregulation has a role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.",,"['Hou, Y', 'Wang, X', 'Li, L', 'Fan, R', 'Chen, J', 'Zhu, T', 'Li, W', 'Jiang, Y', 'Mittal, N', 'Wu, W', 'Peace, D', 'Qian, Z']","['Hou Y', 'Wang X', 'Li L', 'Fan R', 'Chen J', 'Zhu T', 'Li W', 'Jiang Y', 'Mittal N', 'Wu W', 'Peace D', 'Qian Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (FHL2 protein, human)', '0 (Fhl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Muscle Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,2014/09/03 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/09/03 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014254 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.254 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):615-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.254.

Studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NPM1-mutated AML have benefited greatly from several mouse models of this leukemia developed over the past few years. Immunocompromised mice xenografted with NPM1-mutated AML served as the first valuable tool for defining the biology of the disease in vivo. Subsequently, genetically engineered mouse models of the NPM1 mutation, including transgenic and knock-in alleles, allowed the generation of mice with a constant genotype and a reproducible phenotype. These models have been critical for investigating the nature of the molecular effects of these mutations, defining the function of leukemic stem cells in NPM1-mutated AML, identifying chemoresistant preleukemic hemopoietic stem cells and unraveling the key molecular events that cooperate with NPM1 mutations to induce AML in vivo.

As AID causes a substantial amount of off-target mutations, its activity has been associated with lymphomagenesis and clonal evolution of B-cell malignancies. Although it has been shown that AID is expressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a clear analysis of in vivo AID activity in this B-cell malignancy remained elusive. In this study performed on primary human CLL samples, we report that, despite the presence of a dominant VDJ heavy chain region, a substantial intraclonal diversity was observed at VDJ as well as at IgM switch regions (Smu), showing ongoing AID activity in vivo during disease progression. This AID-mediated heterogeneity was higher in CLL subclones expressing CD86, which we identified as the proliferative CLL fraction. Finally, CD86 expression correlated with shortened time to first treatment and increased gamma-H2AX focus formation. Our data demonstrate that AID is active in CLL in vivo and thus, AID likely contributes to clonal evolution of CLL.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

We retrospectively analyzed 4 cases of metachronous/concomitant B-cell neoplasms with discordant light-chain/heavy-chain restrictions. The primary diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 2), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n = 1), and pediatric follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 1). The respective secondary diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 2), plasmablastic myeloma, and pediatric FL. The secondary B-cell neoplasm occurred after the primary diagnosis in 3 cases, with the median interval of 120 months (range, 21-216), whereas the remaining 1 case had the 2 neoplasms (CLL/DLBCL) diagnosed concurrently. Histology suggested aggressive transformation in 3 cases and recurrence in 1 case (FL). Nonetheless, 3 cases showed discordant light-chain restrictions between the 2 B-cell neoplasms, whereas in the remaining case (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/plasmablastic myeloma), the 2 neoplasms shared kappa light-chain restriction but expressed different heavy-chain isotypes (IgM versus IgA). The 2 CLL/DLBCL cases had polymerase chain reaction-based IGH/K gene rearrangement study and amplicon sequence analysis performed, which demonstrated distinct clonal amplicons between the 2 B-cell neoplasms in each case.

An unambiguous picture has emerged where tumours are depleted of 5hmC compared to corresponding normal tissue, but it is not known whether lack of 5hmC is a cause or a consequence of tumourigenesis. Experimental data reveals a dual tumour-suppressive and oncogenic role for TET proteins. Tet2 mutations are drivers in haematological malignancies but Tet1 had an oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged leukaemia, where Tet1 is overexpressed. Overexpression of Tet2 in melanoma cells re-established the 5hmC landscape and suppressed cancer progression but inhibiting Tet1 in non-transformed cells did not initiate cellular transformation.

In the present work, we developed NanoLuc as a novel quantitative protein fusion tag for efficient overexpression in Escherichia coli and ultrasensitive bioluminescent assays using human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a model protein. LIF is an interleukin 6 family cytokine that elicits pleiotropic effects on a diverse range of cells by activating a heterodimeric LIFR/gp130 receptor. Recombinant preparation of the biologically active LIF protein is quite difficult due to its hydrophobic nature and three disulfide bonds. Using the novel NanoLuc-fusion approach, soluble 6xHis-NanoLuc-LIF fusion protein was efficiently overexpressed in E. coli and enzymatically converted to monomeric mature LIF. Both the mature LIF and the NanoLuc-fused LIF had high biological activities in a leukemia M1 cell proliferation inhibition assay and in a STAT3 signaling activation assay. The NanoLuc-fused LIF retained high binding affinities with the overexpressed LIFR (Kd = 1.4 +/- 0.4 nM, n = 3), the overexpressed LIFR/gp130 (Kd = 115 +/- 8 pM, n = 3), and the endogenously expressed LIFR/gp130 (Kd = 33.1 +/- 3.2 pM, n = 3), with a detection limit of less than 10 receptors per cell. Thus, the novel NanoLuc-fusion strategy not only provided an efficient approach for preparation of recombinant LIF protein but also provided a novel ultrasensitive bioluminescent tracer for ligand-receptor interaction studies. The novel NanoLuc-fusion approach could be extended to other proteins for both efficient sample preparation and various bioluminescent quantitative assays in future studies.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and Societe francaise de biochimie et biologie', 'Moleculaire (SFBBM).

Curcumin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, is suggested to possess anti-leukemic activity; however, the underlying mechanism has not been well elucidated. In this study, we found that curcumin inhibited cell survival accompanied by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HL60, Kasumi, NB4, and KG1 cells. This was associated with concomitant attenuation of FoxM1 and its downstream genes, such as cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, Cdc25B, survivin, Bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as the reduction of the angiogenic effect of AML cells. We also found that specific downregulation of FoxM1 by siRNA prior to curcumin treatment resulted in enhanced cell survival inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Accordingly, FoxM1 siRNA increased the susceptibility of AML cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. More importantly, curcumin suppressed FoxM1 expression, selectively inhibited cell survival as well as the combination of curcumin and doxorubicin exhibited a more inhibitory effect in primary CD34(+) AML cells, while showing limited lethality in normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. These results identify a novel role for FoxM1 in mediating the biological effects of curcumin in human AML cells. Our data provide the first evidence that curcumin together with chemotherapy or FoxM1 targeting agents may be effective strategies for the treatment of AML. KEY MESSAGE: Curcumin inhibited AML cell survival and angiogenesis and induced chemosensitivity. Aberrant expression of FoxM1 induces AML cell survival and chemoresistance. Inactivation of FoxM1 contributes to curcumin-induced anti-leukemic effects.

It manifests with paradoxical hemodynamic deterioration and/or pulmonary edema, commonly associated with ventricular dysfunction. We sought to elucidate factors associated with mortality in PDS. METHODS: MEDLINE was systematically searched for PDS case reports and case series published between 1983 and 2013. For this analysis, clinical variables, echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables, details of drainage procedure and clinical outcomes were collected for each case. RESULTS: A total of 35 cases (12 male, 23 female) were identified. PDS developed after pericardiocentesis, pericardiostomy, or both, in 18, 16, and one patients, respectively. Cardiac tamponade was the indication in 33 cases (94%). The mean age was 47 +/- 17 years. The mean amount of effusion drained was 888 mL. The minimum amount of effusion drained was 450 mL. The onset of PDS after the procedure varied widely, ranging from 'immediate' to 48 hours. Presentations included 10 (29%) with cardiogenic pulmonary edema without shock, 14 (40%) with left ventricular failure, three (9%) with right ventricular failure, seven (20%) with biventricular failure, and one (3%) with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Ten patients (29%) died of PDS. Mortality was associated only with surgical drainage (p<0.001). Severe LV dysfunction normalized in PDS survivors.

However, there is growing evidence that IL-32 also plays a mediatory role intracellularly. In this study, we present evidence that IL-32alpha modifies and inhibits promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator that regulates the expression of a subset of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). We screened IL-32alpha-interacting proteins in a human spleen cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid assay, and investigated the functional relevance of the interaction between IL-32alpha and PLZF. We demonstrated that IL-32alpha interacts with protein kinase C (PKC)delta and PKCvarepsilon in a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) dependent way, and that PKCvarepsilon regulates the interaction of IL-32alpha with PLZF. We verified the involvement of PKCvarepsilon in the interaction between these proteins by using various PKC inhibitors. PLZF is known to be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1, but it is unclear whether SUMO-2 conjugation of PLZF occurs. We showed that IL-32alpha inhibited SUMO-2-conjugation of PLZF. Further, we demonstrated that sumoylated PLZF decreased when IL-32alpha was co-expressed. PKCvarepsilon affected the sumoylation of PLZF only in the presence of IL-32alpha because PKC inhibitor treatment did not reduce PLZF sumoylation in the absence of IL-32alpha. We finally investigated whether IL-32alpha-mediated inhibition of PLZF sumoylation affected the transcriptional activity of PLZF, and demonstrated that the inhibition of sumoylation of PLZF by IL-32alpha down-regulated ISGs induced by PLZF.

The PCYC-1102-CA study was a five-arm phase Ib/II open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study in CLL/SLL. The arms and accruals were 420 and 840 mg/day treatment-naive elderly CLL/SLL (N = 27 and N = 4, respectively), 420 and 840 mg/day relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (N = 27 and N = 34, respectively), and 420 mg/day high-risk CLL/SLL (N = 24). The results were generated through statistical modeling using data from a clinical trial (PCYC-1102) in five cohorts of treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory CLL patients treated at 420 and 840 mg daily of ibrutinib. In cases in which the initial increase in ALC doubles by day 28, it takes patients longer to reach their maximum ALC when compared with those with a lower rate of increase.

Next-generation sequencing has been used to characterize DNA methylation status at the genome scale, but suffers from high sequencing cost in the case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or from reduced resolution (inability to precisely define which of the CpGs are methylated) with capture-based techniques. RESULTS: Here we present a computational method that computes nucleotide-resolution methylation values from capture-based data by incorporating fragment length profiles into a model of methylation analysis. We demonstrate that it compares favorably with nucleotide-resolution bisulfite sequencing and has better predictive power with respect to a reference than window-based methods, often used for enrichment data. The described method was used to produce the methylation data used in tandem with gene expression to produce a novel and clinically significant gene signature in acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, we introduce a complementary statistical method that uses this nucleotide-resolution methylation data for detection of differentially methylated features.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Such treatment is potentially curative for selected patients who have a relatively short predicted survival with other treatment modalities. This article summarises the experience and results from ASCT at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included all of the 734 adult patients who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the Department of Haematology, Rikshospitalet, later Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, from November 1985 to October 2012. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, altogether 384 patients were alive, and the five and ten-year survival rates were 54% and 48% respectively. The median follow-up time was six years. A total of 339 patients (46%) had developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and 250 (73%) of these had GvHD >/= grade II. Altogether 280 out of 602 patients who lived >/= 100 days after the transplantation (46.5%) developed chronic GvHD.

Recent studies suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can produce proapoptotic signals, amplifying the apoptotic signaling cascade. The crosstalk between mitochondria and ER plays a decisive role in many cellular events but especially in cell death. Bcl-2 family proteins located in the ER and mitochondria can influence not only the function of the two organelles but also the interaction between them. Therefore, the Bcl-2 family of proteins may also be involved in the mechanism of tumor chemotherapy resistance by influencing crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria.

L-ASP's anticancer activity is believed to be associated primarily with depletion of asparagine, but secondary glutaminase activity has also been implicated in its anticancer mechanism of action. To investigate the effects of L-ASP on amino acid metabolism, we have developed an LC-MS/MS metabolomics platform for high-throughput quantitation of 29 metabolites, including all 20 proteinogenic amino acids, 6 metabolically related amino acid derivatives (ornithine, citrulline, sarcosine, taurine, hypotaurine, and cystine), and 3 polyamines (putrescince, spermidine, and spermine) in adherent cultured cells. When we examined the response of OVCAR-8 ovarian cancer cells in culture to L-ASP, asparagine was depleted from the medium within seconds. Interestingly, intracellular asparagine was also depleted rapidly, and the mechanism was suggested to involve rapid export of intracellular asparagine followed by rapid conversion to aspartic acid by L-ASP. We also found that L-ASP-induced cell death was more closely associated with glutamine concentration than with asparagine concentration. Time-course analysis revealed the dynamics of amino acid metabolism after feeding cells with fresh medium. Overall, this study provides new insight into L-ASP's mechanism of action, and the optimized analytical method can be extended, with only slight modification, to other metabolically active amino acids, related compounds, and a range of cultured cell types.",,"['Purwaha, Preeti', 'Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Silva, Leslie P', 'Hawke, David H', 'Weinstein, John N']","['Purwaha P', 'Lorenzi PL', 'Silva LP', 'Hawke DH', 'Weinstein JN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Metabolomics,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,101274889,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Amino acid', 'L-Asparaginase', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Metabolism', 'Metabolomics', 'Ovarian cancer']",2014/09/02 06:00,2014/09/02 06:01,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11306-014-0634-1 [doi]', '634 [pii]']",ppublish,Metabolomics. 2014;10(5):909-919. doi: 10.1007/s11306-014-0634-1.

Mutations of JAK2(V617F) or MPL(W515K/L) were absent in pediatric patients with PMF according to previous studies. Recently, mutations in calreticulin (CALR) were described in adult patients with JAK2/MPL-unmutated PMF. Our study aimed to analyze the clinical and genetic features of Chinese pediatric patients with PMF. PROCEDURES: We retrospectively investigated 14 pediatric patients diagnosed as PMF according to WHO 2008 criteria. Direct sequencing was performed for the existence of genetic alterations in JAK2, MPL, TET2, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, SRSF2, EZH2, DNMT3A and CALR. RESULTS: In our cohort, all patients had anemia, three patients (21%) had splenomegaly, six patients (43%) had micromegakaryocytes at time of diagnosis. No patient had spontaneous remission and six patients (43%) transformed to acute myelocytic leukemia. In nine patients with evaluable cytogenetic information, three subjects (33%) had abnormal karyotypes. The median survival from time of diagnosis was 28 months. Seven patients (50%) had type 2 mutations of CALR. No patient had mutations in the other candidate genes. There was no statistical differences in age, gender, hemoglobin, WBC, neutrophil and platelet counts, percentage of circulating blast, overall survival and leukemia transformation between patients with and without CALR mutation. CONCLUSION: Our study documented that Chinese pediatric patients with PMF in our cohort had its own clinical characteristics and poor outcome. CALR mutations were detected in 50% of our pediatric patients with PMF. Based on our study, CALR mutations screening could be used as molecular marker for diagnosis of pediatric patients with PMF.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['An, Wenbin', 'Wan, Yang', 'Guo, Ye', 'Chen, Xiaojuan', 'Ren, Yuanyuan', 'Zhang, Jingliao', 'Chang, Lixian', 'Wei, Wei', 'Zhang, Peihong', 'Zhu, Xiaofan']","['An W', 'Wan Y', 'Guo Y', 'Chen X', 'Ren Y', 'Zhang J', 'Chang L', 'Wei W', 'Zhang P', 'Zhu X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['CALR', 'mutation', 'pediatric', 'primary myelofibrosis']",2014/09/02 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25211 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2256-62. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25211.

Reduced activity of SHIP1 has been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SHIP1 is a target of microRNA-155 (miR-155). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-155/SHIP1 in the pathogenesis of AML. We examined the levels of SHIP1 protein and miR-155 in tissue samples of patients with AML and in AML cell lines. In addition, we investigated cell proliferation, apoptosis and expression of SHIP1/PI3K/AKT pathway molecules in the THP-1 and U937 cell lines after miR-155 inhibitor or mimics were transfected. We showed that the levels of SHIP1 protein were significantly decreased in tissue samples of patients with some subtypes of AML (M4 or M5) and in AML cell lines with concomitant overexpression of miR-155. In addition, we demonstrated that decreased expression of SHIP1 in the AML cell lines was a consequence of increased levels of miR-155 and can therefore be reversed in vitro through inhibition of miR-155, with subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of cell apoptosis. In conclusion, expression of the SHIP1 protein is targeted by miR-155 in AML. miR-155 acts as an onco-miR, and the miR-155/SHIP1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway could play an important role in the pathogenesis of AML.",,"['Xue, Hua', 'Hua, Luo-Ming', 'Guo, Ming', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Xue H', 'Hua LM', 'Guo M', 'Luo JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPP5D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",,,2014/09/02 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2014.3435 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2014 Nov;32(5):2253-9. doi: 10.3892/or.2014.3435.

Expression of the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax transforms the growth of the mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 from being IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent. Withdrawal of IL-2 from normal activated T cells induces apoptosis, which is mediated through the inducible expression of several proapoptotic proteins, including Bim. In this study, we found that Tax protects IL-2-depleted T cells against Bim-induced apoptosis. Withdrawal of IL-2 from CTLL-2 cells induced a prominent increase in the level of Bim protein in CTLL-2 cells, but not in Tax-transformed CTLL-2 cells. This inhibition of Bim in Tax-transformed CTLL-2 cells was mediated by two mechanisms: downregulation of Bim mRNA and posttranscriptional reduction of Bim protein. Transient expression of Tax in CTLL-2 cells also inhibited IL-2 depletion-induced expression of Bim, however, this decrease in Bim protein expression was not due to downregulation of Bim mRNA, thus indicating that Bim mRNA downregulation in Tax-transformed CTLL-2 occurs only after long-term expression of Tax. Transient expression of Tax in CTLL-2 cells also induced Erk activation, however, this was not involved in the reduction of Bim protein. Knockdown of Bim expression in CTLL-2 cells augmented Tax-induced IL-2-independent transformation. HTLV-1 infection of human T cells also reduced their levels of Bim protein, and restoring Bim expression in HTLV-1-infected cells reduced their proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that Tax-induced downregulation of Bim in HTLV-1-infected T cells promotes their IL-2-independent growth, thereby supporting the persistence of HTLV-1 infection in vivo.",['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Inappropriate administration of chemotherapy drugs can have adverse effects in cancer patients. Our objective was to assess the rate and type of medication errors in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving oral chemotherapy in outpatient setting. PROCEDURE: Prescription and administration of oral chemotherapy drugs in children with ALL were evaluated prospectively to determine rate and type of medication errors. Errors were defined as prescription (physician) level or administration (patient) level errors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-nine drugs were prescribed to 121 patients. Medication errors occurred in 36 (12.5%) prescriptions; 21(7.3%) were administration errors, 13 (4.5%) were prescribing errors, and two errors occurred at both levels. Mercaptopurine (6-MP) was significantly associated with higher rates of errors (Odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, 95% CI [confidence interval] 1-4.1) whereas lapses were less with dexamethasone (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.67). As a result of medication errors 28 (23.1%) patients received inappropriate doses. Twenty five (21%) patients received sub-optimal doses whereas three got higher doses of chemotherapy. On univariate analysis, socioeconomic status, education status of the caregiver, 6-MP and methotrexate were significantly associated with errors (P </= 0.05). On multivariate analysis, </= primary school education of the caregiver and prescription of methotrexate were independent predictors of errors. CONCLUSIONS: Medication errors affected nearly one fourth of the children receiving oral chemotherapy. Future studies are needed to look at effective interventions to avoid chemotherapy associated errors especially amongst the lower strata of society.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Oberoi, Sapna', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Marwaha, Ram Kumar']","['Oberoi S', 'Trehan A', 'Marwaha RK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Developing Countries', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Drug Prescriptions/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medication Errors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'medication errors']",2014/09/02 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25203 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2218-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25203.

Therefore, inhibition of Pim activity by low molecular weight compounds is under investigation as a part of anticancer therapeutic strategies. We have synthesized a series of pyrrolo[2,3-a]carbazole derivatives that significantly inhibited Pim protein kinases at submicromolar concentrations. Particularly, benzodiazocine derivative 1 potently inhibited Pim-1 and -3 isoforms in in vitro kinase assays (IC50 8 nM and 13 nM, respectively), whereas Pim-2 activity was less affected (IC50 350 nM). We show here that no inhibitory effect of 1 was detectable at 1 microM against other 22 serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. In addition, 1, possessing a planar pyrrolocarbazole scaffold, demonstrated no significant binding to DNA, nor was it a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, suggesting that 1 is likely to be highly selective for Pim-1 and -3. Importantly, whereas 1 exerted a negligible cytotoxicity for human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line at concentrations >10 microM within 72 h of cell exposure, it synergized at nontoxic concentrations with the antitumor drug doxorubicin (Dox) in killing HCT116 cells: IC50 of Dox alone and Dox+1 were ~200 nM and ~25 nM, respectively. These data strongly suggest that 1 emerges as a prospective antitumor drug candidate due to its selectivity to individual Pim protein kinases and the ability to potentiate the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics.",,"['Moreau, Pascale', 'Dezhenkova, Lyubov G', 'Anizon, Fabrice', 'Nauton, Lionel', 'Thery, Vincent', 'Liang, Shuguang', 'Kaluzhny, Dmitry N', 'Shtil, Alexander A']","['Moreau P', 'Dezhenkova LG', 'Anizon F', 'Nauton L', 'Thery V', 'Liang S', 'Kaluzhny DN', 'Shtil AA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,,2014/09/02 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-61916 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520614666140825124456 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2014;14(9):1228-36. doi: 10.2174/1871520614666140825124456.,14,,"['Clermont Universite, Universite Blaise Pascal, Institut de Chimie de Clermont Ferrand (ICCF) - UMR CNRS 6296, 24 Avenue des Landais, BP 10448 63000 Clermont- Ferrand, France.

Limited experience is available on the safety and efficacy of HDT-ASCT in elderly patients. This is a single-center, retrospective study examining outcomes of HDT-ASCT for 202 NHL patients, ages 60 years and older, between January 2001 and December 2012. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed according to age at HDT-ASCT, hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI), NHL histology, and remission status at the time of HDT-ASCT. The median age was 65 years (range, 60 to 74) and the majority had either diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 73, 37%) or mantle cell lymphoma (n = 69, 34%). One hundred and fifteen patients (57%) had high HCT-CI scores at the time of HDT-ASCT. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 to 11.9 years) for survivors, PFS and OS at 3 years were 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53% to 68%) and 73% (95% CI, 67% to 80%), respectively. Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was 4% both at 100 days and at 1 year after HDT-ASCT. Age and HCT-CI score were not associated with OS or PFS, and high HCT-CI did not correlate with TRM. Seven patients (4%) developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia at a median of 35 months (range, 6 to 48) after HDT-ASCT. In this single-center cohort of elderly patients with NHL undergoing HDT-ASCT, this intervention was proven tolerable and effective, with results similar to those of historic controls in younger patients.

METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) samples obtained from 72 patients with leukemia, and 18 normal healthy subjects were assayed for their OCT-4 expression using both flow cytometry and RT-PCR. RESULTS: OCT-4 expression in BM nucleated cells of acute leukemia patients (n=33) was significantly higher than that of complete remission and chronic phase leukemia patients (n=39, p<0.001) and healthy donors (n=18, p<0.001). OCT-4 expression had a significant positive relation with CD34 expression (n=43, r=0.721, p<0.001) and the proportion of naive cells (n=60, r=0.687, p<0.001). In addition, the results of QRT-PCR detection showed that the OCT-4A had increased expression in BM nucleated cells in the patients with acute leukemia (n=33, median 16.585, range 0.38-169.62) compared to that in leukemia patients with chronic phase and in complete remission (n=39, median 3.34, range 0.04-44.49, p<0.001) and that of normal controls (n=18, median 2.89, range 0.18-16.23, p<0.001).

Leukemia is a common neoplastic disease of the blood or bone marrow characterized by the presence of immature leukocytes and is one of the leading causes of death due to cancer. Forkhead transcription factors, FOXM1 and FOXO family members (FOXOs), are important mediators in leukemia development. Aberrant expression of FOXM1 and FOXOs results in leukemogenesis. Usually the expression of FOXM1 is upregulated, whereas the expression of FOXOs is downregulated due to phosphorylation, nuclear exclusion and degradation in leukemia. On the one hand, FOXOs are bona fide tumor suppressors, on the other hand, active FOXOs maintain leukemia stem cells and stimulate drug resistance genes, contributing to leukemogenesis. FOXM1 and FOXOs have been proven to be potential targets for the development of leukemia therapeutics. They are also valuable diagnostic and prognostic markers in leukemia for clinical applications. This review summarizes the present knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms by which FOXM1 and FOXOs modulate leukemogenesis and leukemia development, the clinical relevance of these FOX proteins in leukemia and related areas that warrant further investigation.",,"['Zhu, Hong']",['Zhu H'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO4 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO6 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,,2014/09/02 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2014.3357 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2014 Oct;32(4):1327-34. doi: 10.3892/or.2014.3357.

Such age-related changes in the activity of the HPA axis has overexposed the brain and peripheral organs to the effects of the glucocorticoids, increasing the morbidity and mortality rates of the elderly. Debate among scientists regarding the contributions of HPA axis age-related changes of impaired feedback regulation vs. direct overactivation persists. Supporters of impaired feedback regulation assumed that this effect might be the consequence of the hippocampal age-related neuronal loss and the reduction of the number of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. On the other hand, healthy elderly individuals are characterized by an increase of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and the development of a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, known as inflammaging. Cytokines central to inflammaging send signals to the brain, activate HPA axis, and, by increased cortisol secretion, down-regulate inflammaging in a process known as anti-inflammaging. Even as these cytokines act at the level of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, they are hampered by the intact blood-brain barrier. Further, the corticotropes in the anterior pituitary do not express cytokine receptors, and the density of folliculo-stellate cells generally increases with age. Therefore, we assumed that folliculo-stellate cells were the target structures through which the elevated levels of cytokines, as a part of the inflammaging phenomenon, would cause the overactivation of the HPA axis in healthy elderly individuals. Folliculo-stellate cells are non-endocrine cells that were originally considered to act as supporting cells for the endocrine cells. Despite the fact that FS cells do not produce any of the established hormones of the anterior pituitary, they secrete paracrine agents that act locally to modulate pituitary responses to hypothalamic and peripheral signals. There is evidence of cytokines characteristically involved in inflammaging. For example, IL-1 and TNF-alpha are thought to stimulate folliculo-stellate cells to release various paracrine agents, including IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Through different mechanisms, these agents induce ACTH release by corticotropes. Therefore, it can be concluded that folliculo-stellate cells may act as potent mediators of the age-related HPA axis hyperactivity induced by cytokines characteristic of the inflammaging phenomenon in healthy elderly individuals.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to (i) measure incidence of divorce, reduced career opportunities, changes to work hours, home relocation, and changes to family planning at one year after ALL diagnosis; and (ii) Identify family and patient factors associated with these events. PROCEDURE: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 159 children with average risk-ALL enrolled and treated on COG protocol AALL0331 at 31 selected sites. Eligibility criteria included age >/=2 years and English or Spanish comprehension. Parents completed surveys at three time points during the first 12 months of therapy. RESULTS: Parents were at significantly increased risk of loss of employment (46% vs. 9.1%, P </= 0.001) than peers nationally. 13% divorced/separated, 27% relocated homes, 22% decided not to have more children, 51% declined occupational opportunities, and 68% decreased work hours. In adjusted analyses, relocation correlated with less maternal education (OR: 4.27 [95% CI: 1.43-12.82]). Declining parental opportunities associated with family income <$50,000 (OR: 4.25 [95% CI: 1.50-12.02]) and child <5 years old (OR: 4.21 [95% CI: 1.73-10.25]). Deciding not to have more children correlated with smaller family size 2-3 versus 4-5 (OR: 3.62 [95% CI: 1.10-11.96]). CONCLUSION: Families experience a high incidence of major life changes in the first year of ALL treatment.

METHODS: Nationwide population-based 1:4 age- and gender-matched retrospective cohort study was designed using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. A cohort of 2,892 children <16 years old with JIA was formed as well as a non-JIA cohort of 11,568 in year 2003 to 2005. They were followed up till a diagnosis of malignancy or up to 8 years until 2010. Relative risk (RR), incidence rate ratio (IRR), and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of developing malignancy were calculated. RESULTS: The female to male ratio was 0.79:1. There were 3 cases of incident cancer in the ""MTX use, biologics-naive"" group, only 1 in the anti-TNF biologics-containing group and 29 in the ""both MTX- and biologics-naive"" group, in comparison, there were 50 cases of cancer in the non-JIA comparator group.

As a critical regulator, the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can block the apoptosis by inhibiting the activities of caspases. Scientists find that IAPs are over-expressed in many cancer cells, such as leukemia and B-cell lymphoma, which elucidate that high levels of IAPs are closely related to tumorigenesis and cancer development. Thus, targeting IAPs may be an attractive strategy for anti-tumor treatment. As an endogenous antagonist of IAPs, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) can suppress their activities through directly binding to IAPs. Based on structural biology study, Smac interacts with IAPs through the Ala-Val-Pro-Ile (AVPI) tetra-peptide of Smac.

A defining characteristic of ALPS is the expansion of double negative T cells (DNTC). Relatively little is known about how defective FAS-driven cell death and the Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway intersect in ALPS patients. OBJECTIVE: We studied changes in Bcl-2 family member expression in ALPS to determine whether the Bcl-2 pathway might provide a therapeutic target. METHODS: We used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in T cells from 12 ALPS patients and determined the in vitro sensitivity of ALPS DNTC to the pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. RESULTS: The pro-apoptotic molecule, Bim, was significantly elevated in DNTC. Although no general pattern of individual anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members emerged, increased expression of Bim was always accompanied by increased expression of at least 1 anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Strikingly, Bim levels in DNTC correlated significantly with serum IL-10 in ALPS patients, and IL-10 was sufficient to mildly induce Bim in normal and ALPS T cells via a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent mechanism. Finally, ABT-737 preferentially killed ALPS DNTC in vitro. CONCLUSION: Combined, these data show that an IL-10/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway drives Bim expression in ALPS DNTC, which renders them sensitive to BH3 mimetics, uncovering a potentially novel therapeutic approach to ALPS.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The feasibility of novel biomarkers to indicate renal injury due to HD-MTX infusion was studied in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Markers for glomerular and tubular injury were evaluated prospectively after HD-MTX infusion in 20 children with ALL. Plasma creatinine, cystatin C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured 24-48 hr before MTX-infusion and 24, 36, 48, and 72 hr after starting the HD-MTX treatment, and thereafter daily until the MTX concentration was below 0.1 micromol/L. Urine NGAL, beta2 -microglobulin, and creatinine concentrations as well as dipstick and urinalysis were performed at the same time points. RESULTS: In children with ALL, HD-MTX treatment at 5 g/m(2) over 24 hr was well tolerated and none of the patients developed significant glomerular or tubular dysfunction. The mean plasma cystatin C level increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 0.83 mg/L at baseline to 0.94 mg/L at 36 hr after starting the HD-MTX treatment. The cystatin C concentration remained within reference range in all but two patients (10%). There was no significant change in plasma creatinine level during or after HD-MTX treatment, the values being normal in all patients. Plasma and urea NGAL did not increase during or after the HD-MTX treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that plasma cystatin C concentration alone is a sensitive marker to monitor renal function during and after HD-MTX infusion in pediatric ALL patients. Plasma or urine NGAL do not provide any further advantage in the follow-up of these patients.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ylinen, Elisa', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Jahnukainen, Timo']","['Ylinen E', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Jahnukainen T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cystatin C)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/urine', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Cystatin C/*blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/urine', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/urine', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/urine']",['NOTNLM'],"['NGAL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'cystatin C', 'high-dose methotrexate', 'renal function']",2014/09/02 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25137 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2199-202. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25137.

Alternative splicing from a single PML gene generates several PML isoforms (PMLI to PMLVIIb), each harboring a specific carboxy-terminal region. This variability allows each isoform to recruit different partners and thus confers them specific functions. PML gene is directly induced by interferon and certain PML isoforms are implicated in its antiviral properties, as they display intrinsic antiviral activities against RNA or DNA viruses. One isoform, PMLIV, is also implicated in innate immunity by enhancing IFN-beta production during a viral infection.

We analyzed the hierarchy of changes in chromosome number and chromosomal instability, as well as clonal heterogeneity and evolution, in the untreated bone marrow cell samples from 214 B-pALL patients. PROCEDURE: Applying relocation, 2 x 4 color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect copy number alterations (CNAs) of the most commonly involved chromosomes, 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18, 21, and X. This approach allowed us to acquire a dataset correlated for all eight parameters. RESULTS: Based on chromosome number, an average of 6.9 and 10.2, whereas according to unique constellation 15.3 and 26.7 subclones could be identified in the HeL and HeH subgroups, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed the order of CNAs to chromosomes was highly conserved, and network analysis indicated changes in chromosome number were sequential for 80-90% of all numerical aberrations. Significant chromosome instability was revealed in both subgroups of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated using this new approach indicate that chromosomal instability, which causes heterogeneity in the subclonal landscape, and the sequential changes to chromosome numbers, are both determining factors in the pathomechanism of the hyperdiploid B-pALL. These new observations could prompt research into the mitotic machinery of leukemic cells to identify new therapeutic targets for treating this disease.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Alpar, Donat', 'Pajor, Gabor', 'Varga, Peter', 'Kajtar, Bela', 'Poto, Laszlo', 'Matics, Robert', 'Vojcek, Agnes', 'Ottoffy, Gabor', 'Szuhai, Karoly', 'Pajor, Laszlo']","['Alpar D', 'Pajor G', 'Varga P', 'Kajtar B', 'Poto L', 'Matics R', 'Vojcek A', 'Ottoffy G', 'Szuhai K', 'Pajor L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', '*Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['clonal architecture', 'hyperdiploidy', 'iFISH', 'lymphoblastic leukemia']",2014/09/02 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2013/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25217 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2208-14. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25217.

Our aim was to investigate if LQB-118 is able to target FoxO3a and FoxM1 signaling pathways while sensitizing AML cell lines. LQB-118 induced apoptosis in both AML cell lines HL60 (M3 FAB subtype) and U937 (M4/M5 FAB subtype). Cell death occurred independently of alterations in cell cycle distribution. In vivo administration revealed that LQB-118 was not cytotoxic to normal bone marrow-derived cells isolated from mice. LQB-118 induced FoxO3a nuclear translocation and upregulation of its direct transcriptional target Bim, in HL60 cells. However, LQB-118 induced FoxO3a nuclear exclusion, followed by Bim downregulation, in U937 cells. Concomitantly, LQB-118 exposure reduced FoxM1 and Survivin expression in U937 cells, but this effect was more subtle in HL60 cells.

In the present study, we found that jacaric acid (8Z,10E,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid), a CLNA isomer which is present in jacaranda seed oil, inhibited the in vitro growth of human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies showed that jacaric acid triggered cell cycle arrest of EoL-1 cells at the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis of the EoL-1 cells, as measured by the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit, Annexin V assay and JC-1 dye staining. Notably, the jacaric acid-treated EoL-1 cells also underwent differentiation as revealed by morphological and phenotypic analysis.

The up-dated 2008 International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) guidelines recommend using the B-cell count as a basis for the diagnosis of CLL and indicate a B-cell threshold of 5.0 x 10(9)/l. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of these changes on the pattern of presentation and clinical outcome of early CLL. METHODS: For this purpose we analysed 414 patients with previously untreated, Binet stage A CLL diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2010 and registered prospectively at a national database. RESULTS: After patients were reclassified according to updated 2008 IWCLL guidelines, 130 Rai stage 0 CLL patients were reclassifed as clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, resulting in a 31.4% decrease (from 414 to 284) in the diagnosis of early stage CLL. Moreover, a shift towards a more advanced Rai clinical stage under 2008 IWCLL criteria was observed. Finally, the estimated 3-year time to first treatment decreased from 77.2 to 69.9% according to whether 1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria or 2008 IWCLL criteria were used. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the 2008 IWCLL guidelines modify the distribution of Rai stage at diagnosis and shorten the time to first treatment in early CLL patients. We expect that these changes might be considered in the interpretation of epidemiologic studies in CLL and in designing clinical trials of early therapeutic intervention in patients with asymptomatic CLL.",,"['Molica, Stefano', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Lentini, Mirella', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Molica S', 'Giannarelli D', 'Mirabelli R', 'Levato L', 'Gentile M', 'Lentini M', 'Morabito F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['2008 IWCLL guidelines', 'CLL', 'natural history', 'pattern of presentation']",2014/09/02 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.954542 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Oct;7(5):691-5. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.954542.

In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemic activity of emodin alone or emodin in the presence all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and the potential signaling pathway involved. We demonstrated that emodin could significantly enhance the sensitivity to ATRA and present additive differentiation-inducing effects in AML cell line NB4 cells and, especially, in NB4-derived ATRA-resistant MR2 cells. Further study showed that increasing dose of emodin could effectively induce growth inhibition and apoptotic effects in both cell lines as well as in primary leukemic cells from AML patients. Moreover, the apoptotic induction in AML cells was associated with the activation of caspase cascades involving caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. In addition, leukemic cell response to emodin stimuli in vitro was observed through the decreased expression levels of Bcl-2 and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha). Importantly, emodin was demonstrated as a new inhibitor of PI3K/Akt in AML cells, even in primary AML cells. It inhibited Akt phosphoration (p-Akt) at Ser473 as efficiently as mTOR at Ser2448. Consistently, it exerted suppression effects on the phosphoration of mTOR downstream targets, 4E-BP1 and p70S6K. Taken together, these findings indicate that emodin might be developed as a promising anti-leukemic agent to improve the patient outcome in AML.",,"['Chen, Yingyu', 'Li, Jing', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Zheng, Jing', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Liu, Tingbo', 'Lin, Zhenxing', 'Lin, Minhui']","['Chen Y', 'Li J', 'Hu J', 'Zheng J', 'Zheng Z', 'Liu T', 'Lin Z', 'Lin M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Emodin/*administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/09/02 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2610 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Nov;45(5):2076-84. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2610.

Here, we report function and mechanisms of miR-181 family in myeloid differentiation and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aberrant overexpression of all the miR-181 family members (miR-181a/b/c/d) was detected in French-American-British M1, M2 and M3 subtypes of adult AML patients. By conducting gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-181a inhibits granulocytic and macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) by directly targeting and downregulating the expression of PRKCD (which then affected the PRKCD-P38-C/EBPalpha pathway), CTDSPL (which then affected the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein) and CAMKK1. The three genes were also demonstrated to be the targets of miR-181b, miR-181c and miR-181d, respectively. Significantly decreases in the expression levels of the target proteins were detected in AML patients. Inhibition of the expression of miR-181 family members owing to Lenti-miRZip-181a infection in bone marrow blasts of AML patients increased target protein expression levels and partially reversed myeloid differentiation blockage. In the mice implanted with AML CD34+ HSPCs, expression inhibition of the miR-181 family by Lenti-miRZip-181a injection improved myeloid differentiation, inhibited engraftment and infiltration of the leukemic CD34+ cells into the bone marrow and spleen, and released leukemic symptoms.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Nonetheless preliminary data have suggested potential activity of ATO in solid tumors including lung cancer. This study aimed to examine the underlying mechanisms of ATO in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. Using a panel of 7 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, the effects of ATO treatment on cell viability, expression of E2F1 and its downstream targets, phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and alteration of apoptotic/anti-apoptotic factors were studied. Tumor growth inhibition in vivo was investigated using a nude mouse xenograft model. ATO decreased cell viability with clinically achievable concentrations (8 microM) in all cell lines investigated. This was accompanied by reduced expression of E2F1, cyclin A2, skp2, c-myc, thymidine kinase and ribonucleotide reductase M1, while p-c-Jun was upregulated. Cell viability was significantly decreased with E2F1 knockdown. Treatment with ATO resulted in phosphatidylserine externalization in H23 cells and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in all cell lines, associated with truncation of Bid, downregulation of Bcl-2, upregulation of Bax and Bak, caspase-9 and -3 activation and PARP cleavage. Using the H358 xenograft model, the tumor growth was suppressed in the ATO treatment group during 8 days of treatment, associated with downregulation of E2F1 and upregulation of truncated Bid and cleaved caspase-3. In conclusion, ATO has potent in vitro and in vivo activity in lung adenocarcinoma, partially mediated through E2F1 downregulation and apoptosis.",,"['Lam, Sze-Kwan', 'Li, Yuan-Yuan', 'Zheng, Chun-Yan', 'Leung, Leanne Lee', 'Ho, James Chung-Man']","['Lam SK', 'Li YY', 'Zheng CY', 'Leung LL', 'Ho JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Adenocarcinoma of Lung', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/09/02 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/09/02 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2609 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Nov;45(5):2033-43. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2609.

Previously, study size has limited the ability to compare and contrast the risk factor profiles among these heterogeneous subtypes. METHODS: We pooled individual-level data from 17 471 NHL cases and 23 096 controls in 20 case-control studies from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph). We estimated the associations, measured as odds ratios, between each of 11 NHL subtypes and self-reported medical history, family history of hematologic malignancy, lifestyle factors, and occupation. We then assessed the heterogeneity of associations by evaluating the variability (Q value) of the estimated odds ratios for a given exposure among subtypes. Finally, we organized the subtypes into a hierarchical tree to identify groups that had similar risk factor profiles. Statistical significance of tree partitions was estimated by permutation-based P values (P NODE). RESULTS: Risks differed statistically significantly among NHL subtypes for medical history factors (autoimmune diseases, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, eczema, and blood transfusion), family history of leukemia and multiple myeloma, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and certain occupations, whereas generally homogeneous risks among subtypes were observed for family history of NHL, recreational sun exposure, hay fever, allergy, and socioeconomic status. Overall, the greatest difference in risk factors occurred between T-cell and B-cell lymphomas (P NODE < 1.0x10(-4)), with increased risks generally restricted to T-cell lymphomas for eczema, T-cell-activating autoimmune diseases, family history of multiple myeloma, and occupation as a painter. We further observed substantial heterogeneity among B-cell lymphomas (P NODE < 1.0x10(-4)). Increased risks for B-cell-activating autoimmune disease and hepatitis C virus seropositivity and decreased risks for alcohol consumption and occupation as a teacher generally were restricted to marginal zone lymphoma, Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma/leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and/or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel approach to investigate etiologic heterogeneity among NHL subtypes, we identified risk factors that were common among subtypes as well as risk factors that appeared to be distinct among individual or a few subtypes, suggesting both subtype-specific and shared underlying mechanisms. Further research is needed to test putative mechanisms, investigate other risk factors (eg, other infections, environmental exposures, and diet), and evaluate potential joint effects with genetic susceptibility.",['Published by Oxford University Press 2014.'],"['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Vajdic, Claire M', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Chiu, Brian C H', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Turner, Jennifer J', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Chang, Ellen T', 'Glimelius, Bengt', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Crosignani, Paolo', 'di Lollo, Simonetta', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Nanni, Oriana', 'Ramazzotti, Valerio', 'Rodella, Stefania', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Stagnaro, Emanuele', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Vindigni, Carla', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Foretova, Lenka', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Davis, Scott', 'de Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Hartge, Patricia', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Holly, Elizabeth A', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Feldman, Andrew L', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Liebow, Mark', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Cantor, Kenneth P', 'Kane, Eleanor V', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Roman, Eve', 'Smith, Alex', 'Brooks-Wilson, Angela', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Kricker, Anne', 'Holford, Theodore R', 'Lan, Qing', 'Zheng, Tongzhang', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Dal Maso, Luigino', 'Franceschi, Silvia', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Negri, Eva', 'Serraino, Diego', 'Bernstein, Leslie', 'Levine, Alexandra', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Kelly, Jennifer L', 'Berndt, Sonja I', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Clarke, Christina A', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Foran, James M', 'Kadin, Marshall E', 'Paltiel, Ora', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Sampson, Joshua N']","['Morton LM', 'Slager SL', 'Cerhan JR', 'Wang SS', 'Vajdic CM', 'Skibola CF', 'Bracci PM', 'de Sanjose S', 'Smedby KE', 'Chiu BC', 'Zhang Y', 'Mbulaiteye SM', 'Monnereau A', 'Turner JJ', 'Clavel J', 'Adami HO', 'Chang ET', 'Glimelius B', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Melbye M', 'Crosignani P', 'di Lollo S', 'Miligi L', 'Nanni O', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Costantini AS', 'Stagnaro E', 'Tumino R', 'Vindigni C', 'Vineis P', 'Becker N', 'Benavente Y', 'Boffetta P', 'Brennan P', 'Cocco P', 'Foretova L', 'Maynadie M', 'Nieters A', 'Staines A', 'Colt JS', 'Cozen W', 'Davis S', 'de Roos AJ', 'Hartge P', 'Rothman N', 'Severson RK', 'Holly EA', 'Call TG', 'Feldman AL', 'Habermann TM', 'Liebow M', 'Blair A', 'Cantor KP', 'Kane EV', 'Lightfoot T', 'Roman E', 'Smith A', 'Brooks-Wilson A', 'Connors JM', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Armstrong BK', 'Kricker A', 'Holford TR', 'Lan Q', 'Zheng T', 'Orsi L', 'Dal Maso L', 'Franceschi S', 'La Vecchia C', 'Negri E', 'Serraino D', 'Bernstein L', 'Levine A', 'Friedberg JW', 'Kelly JL', 'Berndt SI', 'Birmann BM', 'Clarke CA', 'Flowers CR', 'Foran JM', 'Kadin ME', 'Paltiel O', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Linet MS', 'Sampson JN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

METHODS: We performed an exploratory pooled study of 152 ALL cases and 23096 controls from 16 case-control studies to investigate the role of medical history, lifestyle, family history, and occupational risk factors and risk of ALL. Age- race/ethnicity-, sex-, and study-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: An increased risk of ALL was found in those with a family history of a hematological malignancy (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.22 to 5.54) and in leather (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 1.35 to 11.35) and sewing/embroidery workers (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.00 to 8.49). Consumers of alcohol had an increased risk of B-cell ALL (OR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.18 to 6.95). CONCLUSIONS: The small number of statistically significant risk factors identified out of the 112 variables examined could be chance findings and will require further replication to assess their role in the etiology of adult ALL.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Age-, race and/or ethnicity-, sex-, and study-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The usual patterns for age and sex in HCL were observed, with a median age of 55 years and sex ratio of 3.7 males to females. Cigarette smoking was inversely associated with HCL (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.71) with dose-response relationships observed for duration, frequency, and lifetime cigarette smoking (P(trend) < .001). In contrast, occupation as a farmer was positively associated with HCL (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.36 to 4.01), with a dose-response relationship observed for duration (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 0.85 to 3.88 for </= 10 years vs never; and OR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.50 to 5.93 for >10 years vs never; P(trend) = .025). Adult height was also positively associated with HCL (OR = 2.69, 95% CI = 1.39 to 5.29 for upper vs lower quartile of height). The observed associations remained consistent in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations of an increased risk of HCL from farming exposures and decreased risk from smoking exposures, independent of one another, support a multifactorial origin and an etiological specificity of HCL compared with other non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. The positive association with height is a novel finding that needs replication.",['Published by Oxford University Press 2014.'],"['Monnereau, Alain', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Hughes, Ann Maree', 'Smith, Alex', 'Glimelius, Bengt', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Berndt, Sonja I', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Norman, Aaron D', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Sampson, Joshua N', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Monnereau A', 'Slager SL', 'Hughes AM', 'Smith A', 'Glimelius B', 'Habermann TM', 'Berndt SI', 'Staines A', 'Norman AD', 'Cerhan JR', 'Sampson JN', 'Morton LM', 'Clavel J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

METHODS: We investigated risk factors for sporadic BL in 295 cases compared with 21818 controls in a pooled analysis of 18 case-control studies in the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph). Cases were defined to include typical BL or Burkitt-like lymphoma. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations were calculated separately for younger (<50 years) and older (>/= 50 years) BL using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Cases included 133 younger BL and 159 older BL (age was missing for three cases) and they were evenly split between typical BL (n = 147) and Burkitt-like lymphoma (n = 148). BL in younger participants was inversely associated with a history of allergy (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.05), and positively associated with a history of eczema among individuals without other atopic conditions (OR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.20 to 5.40), taller height (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.08 to 4.36), and employment as a cleaner (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.13 to 10.7). BL in older participants was associated with a history of hepatitis C virus seropositivity (OR = 4.19; 95% CI = 1.05 to 16.6) based on three exposed cases. Regardless of age, BL was inversely associated with alcohol consumption and positively associated with height. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that BL in younger and older adults may be etiologically distinct.",['Published by Oxford University Press 2014.'],"['Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Sampson, Joshua N', 'Chang, Ellen T', 'Costas, Laura', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Kelly, Jennifer', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D']","['Mbulaiteye SM', 'Morton LM', 'Sampson JN', 'Chang ET', 'Costas L', 'de Sanjose S', 'Lightfoot T', 'Kelly J', 'Friedberg JW', 'Cozen W', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Slager SL', 'Birmann BM', 'Weisenburger DD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

A number of studies have evaluated associations between risk factors and CLL/SLL risk. However, these associations remain inconsistent or lacked confirmation. This may be due, in part, to the inadequate sample size of CLL/SLL cases. METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of 2440 CLL/SLL cases and 15186 controls from 13 case-control studies from Europe, North America, and Australia. We evaluated associations of medical history, family history, lifestyle, and occupational risk factors with CLL/SLL risk. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We confirmed prior inverse associations with any atopic condition and recreational sun exposure. We also confirmed prior elevated associations with usual adult height, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, living or working on a farm, and family history of any hematological malignancy. Novel associations were identified with hairdresser occupation (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.98) and blood transfusion history (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.94). We also found smoking to have modest protective effect (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.99). All exposures showed evidence of independent effects. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified or confirmed several independent risk factors for CLL/SLL supporting a role for genetics (through family history), immune function (through allergy and sun), infection (through hepatitis C virus), and height, and other pathways of immune response. Given that CLL/SLL has more than 30 susceptibility loci identified to date, studies evaluating the interaction among genetic and nongenetic factors are warranted.",['Published by Oxford University Press 2014.'],"['Slager, Susan L', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Lan, Qing', 'Clarke, Christina A', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Norman, Aaron D', 'Sampson, Joshua N', 'Casabonne, Delphine', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Slager SL', 'Benavente Y', 'Blair A', 'Vermeulen R', 'Cerhan JR', 'Costantini AS', 'Monnereau A', 'Nieters A', 'Clavel J', 'Call TG', 'Maynadie M', 'Lan Q', 'Clarke CA', 'Lightfoot T', 'Norman AD', 'Sampson JN', 'Casabonne D', 'Cocco P', 'de Sanjose S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

25174022,NLM,MEDLINE,20150522,20211021,1745-6614 (Electronic) 1052-6773 (Linking),48,2014 Aug,Rationale and Design of the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes Project.,1-14,"BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the most common hematologic malignancy, consists of numerous subtypes. The etiology of NHL is incompletely understood, and increasing evidence suggests that risk factors may vary by NHL subtype. However, small numbers of cases have made investigation of subtype-specific risks challenging. The International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium therefore undertook the NHL Subtypes Project, an international collaborative effort to investigate the etiologies of NHL subtypes. This article describes in detail the project rationale and design. METHODS: We pooled individual-level data from 20 case-control studies (17471 NHL cases, 23096 controls) from North America, Europe, and Australia. Centralized data harmonization and analysis ensured standardized definitions and approaches, with rigorous quality control. RESULTS: The pooled study population included 11 specified NHL subtypes with more than 100 cases: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (N = 4667), follicular lymphoma (N = 3530), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (N = 2440), marginal zone lymphoma (N = 1052), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (N = 584), mantle cell lymphoma (N = 557), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (N = 374), mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (N = 324), Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma/leukemia (N = 295), hairy cell leukemia (N = 154), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (N = 152). Associations with medical history, family history, lifestyle factors, and occupation for each of these 11 subtypes are presented in separate articles in this issue, with a final article quantitatively comparing risk factor patterns among subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium NHL Subtypes Project provides the largest and most comprehensive investigation of potential risk factors for a broad range of common and rare NHL subtypes to date. The analyses contribute to our understanding of the multifactorial nature of NHL subtype etiologies, motivate hypothesis-driven prospective investigations, provide clues for prevention, and exemplify the benefits of international consortial collaboration in cancer epidemiology.",['Published by Oxford University Press 2014.'],"['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Sampson, Joshua N', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Turner, Jennifer J', 'Vajdic, Claire M', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'Chiu, Brian C H', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Spriggs, Michael', 'Robinson, Dennis', 'Norman, Aaron D', 'Kane, Eleanor V', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Kelly, Jennifer L', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Dal Maso, Luigino', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Kadin, Marshall E', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Clarke, Christina A', 'Roman, Eve', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Berndt, Sonja I', 'Mannetje, Andrea', 'de Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Kricker, Anne', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Franceschi, Silvia', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Morton LM', 'Sampson JN', 'Cerhan JR', 'Turner JJ', 'Vajdic CM', 'Wang SS', 'Smedby KE', 'de Sanjose S', 'Monnereau A', 'Benavente Y', 'Bracci PM', 'Chiu BC', 'Skibola CF', 'Zhang Y', 'Mbulaiteye SM', 'Spriggs M', 'Robinson D', 'Norman AD', 'Kane EV', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Kelly JL', 'La Vecchia C', 'Dal Maso L', 'Maynadie M', 'Kadin ME', 'Cocco P', 'Costantini AS', 'Clarke CA', 'Roman E', 'Miligi L', 'Colt JS', 'Berndt SI', 'Mannetje A', 'de Roos AJ', 'Kricker A', 'Nieters A', 'Franceschi S', 'Melbye M', 'Boffetta P', 'Clavel J', 'Linet MS', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Slager SL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Restriction factors are proteins that have the ability to hamper retroviruses' replication and are part of the conserved mechanisms of anti-viral immunity of mammals. The APOBEC3 protein family is the most studied class of restriction factors; they are cytidine deaminases that generate hypermutations in provirus DNA during reverse transcription, thus causing hypermutations in the viral genome, hindering virus replication. One of the feline APOBEC3 genes, named APOBEC3H, encodes two proteins (APOBEC3H and APOBEC3CH). In other mammals, APOBEC3H single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can alter the stability and cellular localization of the encoded protein, thus influencing its subcellular localization and reducing its anti-viral effect. In cats, the association of APOBEC3H SNPs with susceptibility to retroviral infections was not yet demonstrated. Therefore, this study aimed the investigation on the variability of APOBEC3H and the possible association with FIV/FeLV infections. DNA obtained from whole blood of fifty FIV- and/or FeLV-infected cats and fifty-nine FIV- and/or FeLV-uninfected cats were used as templates to amplify two different regions of the APOBEC3H, with subsequent sequencing and analysis. The first region was highly conserved among all samples, while in the second, six single-nucleotide variation points were identified. One of the SNPs, A65S (A65I), was significantly correlated with the susceptibility to FIV and/or FeLV infections. On the other hand, the haplotype analysis showed that the combination ""GGGGCC"" was positively correlated with the lack of FIV and/or FeLV infections. Our results indicate that, as previously shown in other mammals, variability of restriction factors may contribute to susceptibility of domestic cats to retroviral infections; however, these results should be confirmed by more extensive analysis and in vitro experiments.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we characterize the effect of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibition by FK866 in primary CLL cells from patients with various clinical prognostic markers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CLL cells were treated with FK866 to assess viability by Annexin V/PI staining. Functional analysis of FK866 included time- and concentration-dependent evaluation of cellular NAD, ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptotic signaling. Chemosensitization potential by FK866 to fludarabine was also assessed. Prognostic markers were correlated with drug response. RESULTS: FK866 induced CLL cell death by depleting cellular NAD content by day 1, followed by a drop in ATP on day 2. We observed loss of MMP, ROS increase, and induction of apoptotic signaling at day 3. On-target activity of FK866 was confirmed by NAD-mediated rescue of NAD and ATP loss, apoptotic signaling, and viability. The response to FK866 was independent of most prognostic markers. Higher doses were required with short lymphocyte doubling time and positive CD38 status, whereas CLL cells resistant to fludarabine in vitro and from patients with del17p13.1 were equally sensitive to FK866. FK866 did not upregulate the p53-target p21, nor did the p53 activator Nutlin improve FK866-mediated cell death. Furthermore, fludarabine and FK866 were synergistic at clinically relevant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: NAMPT inhibition by FK866 may be a potential treatment for CLL, including patients with del17p13.1 or other high-risk features. FK866 may complement standard agents to enhance their efficacy and/or allow dose reduction for improved tolerability.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Gehrke, Iris', 'Bouchard, Eric D J', 'Beiggi, Sara', 'Poeppl, Armando G', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B', 'Banerji, Versha']","['Gehrke I', 'Bouchard ED', 'Beiggi S', 'Poeppl AG', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB', 'Banerji V']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Piperidines)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology']",,,2014/08/31 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/08/31 06:00'],"['2014/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-0624 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0624 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Sep 15;20(18):4861-72. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0624.

However, limited information is available regarding whether cord blood transplantation (CBT) induces a curative graft-versus-ATLL effect against aggressive ATLL. To evaluate the effect of CBT against ATLL, we retrospectively analyzed data from 175 patients with ATLL who initially underwent single-unit CBT. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 20.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.8% to 27.4%). A multivariate analysis revealed that the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was a favorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, .10; 95% CI, .01 to .94; P = .044). Furthermore, the 2-year OS (42.7%; 95% CI, 28.1% to 56.6%) of patients with grade 1 to 2 acute GVHD was higher than that of patients without acute GVHD (24.2%; 95% CI, 11.2% to 39.8%; P = .048). However, the cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was high (46.1%; 95% CI, 38.2% to 53.7%), and early death was particularly problematic. In conclusion, CBT cures patients with ATLL partly through a graft-versus-ATLL effect. However, novel interventions will be required, particularly in the early phase, to reduce TRM and optimize GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Several molecular markers have been described that help to classify AML patients into risk groups. Mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) gene were recently demonstrated in AML. Approximately 20% patients with AML carry DNMT3A gene mutations and were associated with a poor clinical outcome but its clinical implications in Egyptian AML patients are largely unknown. The aim of the study was to study the incidence and prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 120 patients with de novo AML were examined for mutations in DNMT3A by sequencing. DNMT3A mutations were identified in 34/120 (28%) of AML patients. 15 patients with M4, 14 patients with M5, 3 patient with M2 and 2 patient with M6. DNMT3A mutations were more frequently associated with older age, higher platelet counts and intermediate risk. DNMT3A-mutated patients did not differ regarding complete remission (CR) and disease-free survival (DFS), but had shorter overall survival (OS; P=0.048) than DNMT3A-wild-type patients. Mutations in DNMT3A independently predicted a shorter OS (P=0.049) by multivariate analysis. We concluded that DNMT3A mutations are highly frequent in Egyptian patients with AML and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A complex network of mechanisms involving induction of lineage instructive transcription factors, installation or removal of histone modifications and changes in the DNA methylation pattern locally orchestrate the three-dimensional chromatin structure and determine cell fate. Maturation of myeloid lineages from hematopoietic stem cells has emerged as a powerful model to study those principles of chromatin mechanisms in cellular differentiation and lineage fate selection.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of FLI-1 was performed in specimens from 198 untreated NPC patients. Ninety-nine patients were randomly assigned to the training set to analyze the prognostic value of FLI-1 and other clinicopathological characteristics, while the others were assigned to the testing set for validation. Clinicopathological data were compared using the Pearson chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to test independent prognostic factors and calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Cytoplasmic FLI-1 expression positively correlated with N stage, distant metastasis and death (P<0.05) and also predicted poorer overall survival (OS) (P=0.014), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (P=0.010), progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.031). In multivariate analysis, FLI-1 expression and clinical stage were both independent prognostic factors of poor OS and DMFS. Prognoses of patients in the training set, the testing set, and the entire set were clearly divided into four risk subgroups by supplementing FLI-1 with clinical stage. These results indicate that FLI-1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for NPC patients and suggest that supplementing FLI-1 with clinical stage could be helpful for more accurate risk definition.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

However, an effective combination with other drugs and a feasible dosage has not been identified. A retrospective study of 46 patients with relapsed or refractory ALL was conducted to determine the efficacy of mitoxantrone and Ara-C treatment with (MEC) and or without etoposide (MC). Twenty-seven and 19 patients received MC and MEC chemotherapy, respectively. Twenty-two (48%) patients showed overall response [complete response (CR), 33%; CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), 15%], and 10 of 22 responders received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Median overall survival (OS) was 6.2 months (95% confidence interval, 3.41-9.0). Thirteen (48%) patients in the MC group and 9 (47%) in the MEC group achieved CR/CRp (p = 0.96). Treatment-related mortalities in the MC and MEC groups were 3 (11%) and 4 (21%), respectively (p = 0.36). However, the MEC group frequently presented with grade 3 or higher bacteremia/candidemia (p = 0.013). No difference in OS was observed between the two groups (p = 0.769). In conclusion, salvage therapy consisting of mitoxantrone and Ara-C without etoposide appeared to be an effective bridge therapy to allogeneic SCT for patients with refractory or relapsed ALL.","['(c) 2014 S.

To test the ability to expand HSCs in vitro prior to transplantation, two growth factor cocktails containing stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (STF) or stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, insulin-like growth factor-2, fibroblast growth factor-1 (STIF) either with or without the addition of angiopoietin-like protein-3 (Angptl3) were used. Culturing HSCs in STF and STIF media for 7 days expanded long-term repopulating stem cells content in vivo by approximately 6-fold and approximately 10-fold compared to freshly isolated stem cells. Addition of Angptl3 resulted in increased expansion of these populations by approximately 17-fold and approximately 32-fold, respectively, and was further supported by enforced expression of Angptl3 in HSCs through lentiviral transduction that also promoted HSC expansion. As expansion of highly purified lineage-negative, Sca-1+, c-Kit+ HSCs was less efficient than less pure lineage-negative HSCs, Angptl3 may have a direct effect on HCS but also an indirect effect on accessory cells that support HSC expansion. No evidence for leukemia or toxicity was found during long-term follow up of mice transplanted with ex vivo expanded HSCs or manipulated HSC populations that expressed Angptl3. We conclude that the cytokine combinations used in this study to expand HSCs ex vivo enhances the engraftment in vivo.

DS is a life-threatening complication, characterized by respiratory distress, unexplained fever, weight gain, interstitial lung infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, hypotension and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of DS is made on clinical grounds and has proven to be difficult, because none of the symptoms is pathognomonic for the syndrome without any definitive diagnostic criteria. As DS can have subtle signs and symptoms at presentation but progress rapidly, end-stage DS clinical picture resembles the acute respiratory distress syndrome with extremely poor prognosis; so it is of absolute importance to be conscious of these complications and initiate therapy as soon as it was suspected.

However, cellular consequences of signaling are incompletely defined. Here we explored possible links between BCR signaling and the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress response pathway that can promote survival of normal and malignant cells. Compared with normal B cells, circulating CLL cells expressed increased, but variable, levels of UPR components. Higher expression of CHOP and XBP1 RNAs was associated with more aggressive disease. UPR activation appeared due to prior tissue-based antigenic stimulation because elevated expression of UPR components was detected within lymph node proliferation centers. Basal UPR activation also correlated closely with surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) signaling capacity in vitro in both IGHV unmutated CLL and within mutated CLL. sIgM signaling increased UPR activation in vitro with responders showing increased expression of CHOP and XBP1 RNAs, and PERK and BIP proteins, but not XBP1 splicing. Inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases effectively prevented sIgM-induced UPR activation. Overall, this study demonstrates that sIgM signaling results in activation of some components the UPR in CLL cells. Modulation of the UPR may contribute to variable clinical behavior, and its inhibition may contribute to clinical responses to BCR-associated kinase inhibitors.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Krysov, Sergey', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Coelho, Vania', 'Linley, Adam', 'Sanchez Hidalgo, Marina', 'Carter, Matthew', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Kennedy, Benjamin', 'Duncombe, Andrew S', 'Ashton-Key, Margaret', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Packham, Graham']","['Krysov S', 'Steele AJ', 'Coelho V', 'Linley A', 'Sanchez Hidalgo M', 'Carter M', 'Potter KN', 'Kennedy B', 'Duncombe AS', 'Ashton-Key M', 'Forconi F', 'Stevenson FK', 'Packham G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', '*Unfolded Protein Response']",,,2014/08/30 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/08/30 06:00'],"['2014/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39659-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-567198 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Nov 13;124(20):3101-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-567198.

Powerful methods exist for CNV detection in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, but such data are costly to obtain. Many disease causal CNVs span or are found in genome coding regions (exons), which makes CNV detection using whole exome sequencing (WES) data attractive. If reliably validated against WGS-based CNVs, exome-derived CNVs have potential applications in a clinical setting. Several algorithms have been developed to exploit exome data for CNV detection and comparisons made to find the most suitable methods for particular data samples. The results are not consistent across studies. Here, we review some of the exome CNV detection methods based on depth of coverage profiles and examine their performance to identify problems contributing to discrepancies in published results. We also present a streamlined strategy that uses a single metric, the likelihood ratio, to compare exome methods, and we demonstrated its utility using the VarScan 2 and eXome Hidden Markov Model (XHMM) programs using paired normal and tumour exome data from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. We use array-based somatic CNV (SCNV) calls as a reference standard to compute prevalence-independent statistics, such as sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, for validation of the exome-derived SCNVs. We also account for factors known to influence the performance of exome read depth methods, such as CNV size and frequency, while comparing our findings with published results.","['(c) The Author 2014.

We conducted a search in PubMed, Embase and CNKI covering all published papers up to March, 2014. A total of 9 publications including 10 case-control studies met the inclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were applied to assess association.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human gastric cancer cell line MGC803 cells were treated with various concentration of silibinin. Cellular viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay and apoptosis and cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Protein expression and mRNA of STAT3, and cell cycle and apoptosis regulated genes were detected by Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: Silibinin inhibits growth of MGC803 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Silibinin effectively induces apoptosis of MGC803 cells and arrests MGC803 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, while decreasing the protein expression of p-STAT3, and of STAT3 downstream target genes including Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, survivin at both protein and mRNA levels. In addition, silibinin caused an increase in caspase 3 and caspase 9 protein as well as mRNA levels. Silibinin caused G2/M phage arrest accompanied by a decrease in CDK1 and Cyclin B1 at protein and mRNA levels.. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that silibinin inhibits the proliferation of MGC803 cells, and it induces apoptosis and causes cell cycle arrest by down-regulating CDK1, cyclinB1, survivin, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1 and activating caspase 3 and caspase 9, potentially via the STAT3 pathway.",,"['Wang, Yi-Xin', 'Cai, Hong', 'Jiang, Gang', 'Zhou, Tian-Bao', 'Wu, Hai']","['Wang YX', 'Cai H', 'Jiang G', 'Zhou TB', 'Wu H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 9/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin B1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/*pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Survivin', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2014/08/30 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/08/30 06:00'],"['2014/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.16.6791 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(16):6791-8. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.16.6791.,15,,"['Department of Pharmacy, Sichuan Cancer Hospital, Chengdu, China E-mail : watericedog2014@gmail.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For better understanding of the effect of MDM2 T309G polymorphism on leukemia risk, we performed a meta-analysis. All eligible studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) databases before May 2014. Assessment of associations between the MDM2 T309G polymorphism and leukemia risk was conducted by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Finally, a total of 11 publications covering 12 case-control studies with 2, 362 cases and 5, 562 controls concerning MDM2 T309G polymorphism with respect to leukemia were included in the meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between MDM2 T309G polymorphism and leukemia risk in four models in overall populations (G vs T: OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.11- 1.49, p=0.001; GG vs TT: OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.21-2.30, p=0.002; GG vs TG/TT: OR=1.56, 95% CI=1.21-2.00, p=0.001; GG/TG vs TT: OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.05-1.57, p=0.015).

Elevated tryptase levels are found in subgroups of patients with mastocytosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic eosinophilic leukemia. In these patients, the tryptase level is of diagnostic and/or prognostic significance. In mastocytosis, an elevated tryptase level is a minor criterion of systemic disease and in BCR-ABL1(+) chronic myeloid leukemia, elevated tryptase at diagnosis correlates with treatment responses and overall survival. In patients with elevated tryptase, the enzyme also serves as follow-up parameter and can be employed to measure treatment-responses.

Their role has previously been described in colorectal cancer, as well as in gastric, breast, thyroid, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, glioma, liver, leukemia and many other cancers. In a previous study, we have described protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, M, Z1 and Q genes (PTPRT, PTPRM, PTPRZ1 and PTPRQ) hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer. Thus, in this study, we examined the relation of unbalanced chromosomal alterations within regions covering these four protein tyrosine phosphatase genes with this cancer. One hundred and two cancer tissues were molecularly characterized, including analysis of the BRAF and K-ras mutations and methylator phenotype. The analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed using Comparative Genomic Hybridization. We observed amplification of three regions containing genes coding for PTPs, such as PTPRZ1 (7q31.3, amplified in 23.5% of cases), PTPRQ (12q21.2, amplified in 5.9% of cases), PTPRT (20q12, amplified in 29.4% of cases), along with deletions in the region of PTPRM (18p11.2, deleted in 21.6% of cases). These data may suggest that in sporadic colorectal cancer PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRQ probably act as oncogenes, while PTPRM acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Our study also revealed that gains on chromosome 20q12 and losses on chromosome 18p11.2 are connected with the absence of the BRAF mutation and the conventional adenocarcinoma pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Mashhad is one of the main endemic areas in the world for HTLV-I, and minimizing the risk of HTLV-I transmission through blood transfusion is one of the main duties of the Blood Transfusion Center in Mashhad. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HTLV-I in the blood donor population in Mashhad during 2011-2013. METHODS: All the blood donors in Mashhad from March 2011 to April 2013 who were diagnosed with HTLV-I on the ELISA screening test and the Western blot confirmatory test were included in this seroepidemiological study. RESULTS: From 174,662 blood donors, 327 donors were confirmed to be infected with HTLV-I according to Western blot assay. The seropositive donors ranged in age from 17 to 59, and their mean age was 39.88+/-10.49 years. The overall prevalence rates of HTLV-I infection were calculated as 0.18% and 0.19%, respectively.

NK kill target cells by the vesicular delivery of cytolytic molecules such as Granzyme-B and Granulysin activating different cell death pathways, which can be Caspase-3 dependent or Caspase-3 independent. Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable neoplastic plasma-cell disorder. However, we previously reported the encouraging observation that cord blood-derived NK (CB-NK), a new source of NK, showed anti-tumor activity in an in vivo murine model of MM and confirmed a correlation between high levels of NKG2D expression by MM cells and increased efficacy of CB-NK in reducing tumor burden. We aimed to characterize the mechanism of CB-NK-mediated cytotoxicity against MM cells. We show a Caspase-3- and Granzyme-B-independent cell death, and we reveal a mechanism of transmissible cell death between cells, which involves lipid-protein vesicle transfer from CB-NK to MM cells. These vesicles are secondarily transferred from recipient MM cells to neighboring MM cells amplifying the initial CB-NK cytotoxicity achieved. This indirect cytotoxicity involves the transfer of NKG2D and NKP30 and leads to lysosomal cell death and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species in MM cells. These findings suggest a novel and unique mechanism of CB-NK cytotoxicity against MM cells and highlight the importance of lipids and lipid transfer in this process.

A plasmon ruler is a noble metal nanoparticle pair, tethered in close proximity to one another via a biomolecule, that acts through dipole-dipole interactions and results in the light scattering to increase exponentially.

To align the mechanism of protease activity with building a sensor that can report a binary signal in the presence or absence of caspase-3, we present a caspase-3 selective plasmon ruler (C3SPR) composed of a pair of Zn0.4Fe2.6O4@SiO2@Au core-shell nanoparticles connected by a caspase-3 cleavage sequence. The dielectric core (Zn0.4Fe2.6O4@SiO2)-shell (Au) geometry provided a brighter scattering intensity versus solid Au nanoparticles, and the magnetic core additionally acted as a purification handle during the plasmon ruler assembly. By monitoring the decrease in light scattering intensity per plasmon ruler, we detected caspase-3 activity at single molecule resolution across a broad dynamic range. This was observed to be as low as 100 fM of recombinant material or 10 ng of total protein from cellular lysate. By thorough analyses of single molecule trajectories, we show caspase-3 activation in a drug-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (K562) cancer system as early as 4 and 8 h with greater sensitivity (2- and 4-fold, respectively) than conventional reagents. This study provides future implications for monitoring caspase-3 as a biomarker and efficacy of drugs.",,"['Tajon, Cheryl A', 'Seo, Daeha', 'Asmussen, Jennifer', 'Shah, Neil', 'Jun, Young-wook', 'Craik, Charles S']","['Tajon CA', 'Seo D', 'Asmussen J', 'Shah N', 'Jun YW', 'Craik CS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme Assays/*methods', 'Gold/chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', 'Proteomics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['caspase', 'gold nanoparticles', 'leukemia', 'plasmon coupling', 'single molecule']",2014/08/29 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nn502959q [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2014 Sep 23;8(9):9199-208. doi: 10.1021/nn502959q.

This antibody can be used to image tumors in vivo and target them for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Tumor-specific expression of memHsp70 therefore has the potential to be exploited for theranostic purposes. Given the advantages of peptides as imaging and targeting agents, this study assessed whether a 14-mer tumor penetrating peptide (TPP; TKDNNLLGRFELSG), the sequence of which is derived from the oligomerization domain of Hsp70 which is expressed on the cell surface of tumor cells, can also be used for targeting membrane Hsp70 positive (memHsp70+) tumor cells, in vitro. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The specificity of carboxy-fluorescein (CF-) labeled TPP (TPP) to Hsp70 was proven in an Hsp70 knockout mammary tumor cell system. TPP specifically binds to different memHsp70+ mouse and human tumor cell lines and is rapidly taken up via endosomes. Two to four-fold higher levels of CF-labeled TPP were detected in MCF7 (82% memHsp70+) and MDA-MB-231 (75% memHsp70+) cells compared to T47D cells (29% memHsp70+) that exhibit a lower Hsp70 membrane positivity. After 90 min incubation, TPP co-localized with mitochondrial membranes in memHsp70+ tumors. Although there was no evidence that any given vesicle population was specifically localized, fluorophore-labeled cmHsp70.1 antibody and TPP preferentially accumulated in the proximity of the adherent surface of cultured cells. These findings suggest a potential association between membrane Hsp70 expression and cytoskeletal elements that are involved in adherence, the establishment of intercellular synapses and/or membrane reorganization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the specific binding and rapid internalization of TPP by tumor cells with a memHsp70+ phenotype. TPP might therefore have potential for targeting and imaging the large proportion of tumors ( approximately 50%) that express memHsp70.",,"['Gehrmann, Mathias', 'Stangl, Stefan', 'Foulds, Gemma A', 'Oellinger, Rupert', 'Breuninger, Stephanie', 'Rad, Roland', 'Pockley, Alan G', 'Multhoff, Gabriele']","['Gehrmann M', 'Stangl S', 'Foulds GA', 'Oellinger R', 'Breuninger S', 'Rad R', 'Pockley AG', 'Multhoff G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding']",,,2014/08/29 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0105344 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-16172 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 28;9(8):e105344. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0105344. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0105344 [doi],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Department II, Translational Gastroenterological Oncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medical Department II, Translational Gastroenterological Oncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Radiation Oncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Group (CCG) ''Innate Immunity in Tumor Biology'', Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt, Munich, Germany.""]",PMC4148261,,20140828,,,,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '084399/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein O-fucosyltransferases, such as poFUT1 and poFUT2, catalyze the O-fucosylation of proteins and have important roles in embryonic development. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a critical cytokine in the regulation of embryonic development and implantation. However, the exact roles of poFUTs in embryo migration and invasion and the effects of LIF on the expression of poFUTs have not been studied in detail. In the current study, we showed that poFUT1 and LIF were highly expressed in human trophoblast cells and in the serum of women during the first trimester of a normal pregnancy. However, in patients with threatened abortion, poFUT1 and LIF levels were found to be reduced. There were no significant differences in the expression levels of poFUT2 between the two groups. The migration and invasion potential of trophoblasts in an explant culture and in an in vitro implantation model was decreased or increased upon altering poFUT1 expression levels by siRNA or cDNA transfection. Our results also revealed that LIF upregulated the expression of poFUT1. The upregulation of poFUT1 by LIF promoted trophoblast cell migration and invasion at the fetal-maternal interface by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Taken together, these study findings suggest that poFUT1 may be used as a marker of embryo implantation.",,"['Liu, S', 'Wang, J', 'Qin, H-M', 'Yan, X-M', 'Yang, X-S', 'Liu, C', 'Yan, Q']","['Liu S', 'Wang J', 'Qin HM', 'Yan XM', 'Yang XS', 'Liu C', 'Yan Q']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.221 (polypeptide fucosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Villi/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",,,2014/08/29 06:00,2015/09/09 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014335 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.335 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5:e1396. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.335.,5,10.1038/cddis.2014.335 [doi],"[""Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China."", ""Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathology, The Secondary Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Medical Laboratory, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China."", ""Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China."", ""Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China."", ""Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.""]",PMC4454310,,20140828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging antibacterial resistance in bacterial pathogens infecting febrile neutropenic patients complicates management, and choosing the type of empirical antimicrobial therapy has become a challenge. To further complicate the decision process, not all neutropenic patients are in same category of susceptibility to develop severe infection. While low-risk patients may be treated with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting, high-risk patients usually need to be admitted to hospital and receive parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics until the neutrophil levels recover.

This study determined the effects of CPI-613 on mitochondrial function and defined the MTD, pharmacokinetics, and safety in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human leukemia cell lines were exposed to CPI-613 and mitochondrial function was assayed. A phase I trial was conducted in which CPI-613 was given as a 2-hour infusion on days 1 and 4 for 3 weeks every 28 days. RESULTS: CPI-613 inhibited mitochondrial respiration of human leukemia cells consistent with the proposed mechanism of action. In the phase I trial, 26 patients were enrolled. CPI-613 was well tolerated with no marrow suppression observed. When the infusion time was shortened to 1 hour, renal failure occurred in 2 patients. At 3,780 mg/m(2), there were two dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). At a dose of 2,940 mg/m(2) over 2 hours, no DLTs were observed, establishing this as the MTD. Renal failure occurred in a total of 4 patients and resolved in all but 1, who chose hospice care. CPI-613 has a triphasic elimination with an alpha half-life of approximately 1.34 hours. Of the 21 evaluable, heavily pretreated patients, 4 achieved an objective response and 2 achieved prolonged stabilization of disease for a clinical benefit rate of 29%. Following drug exposure, gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from responders demonstrated immune activation.

The results showed that nobiletin suppressed cell proliferation in various types of AML cell lines. Moreover, nobiletin induced cell-cycle arrest of HL-60 AML cells at the G0/G1 phase by suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Furthermore, nobiletin effectively induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells through caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspases-3 activation concomitantly with a marked induction of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, but without affecting expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, or Bid.

Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Here we investigated the reversal effect of ibrutinib on MRP1-mediated MDR. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. The expression of protein was detected by Western blot. RT-PCR and Q-PCR were performed to detect the expression of MRP1 mRNA. The intracellular accumulation and efflux of substrates for MRP1 were measured by scintillation counter and flow cytometry. HEK293/MRP1 cell xenografts in nude mice were established to study the effects of ibrutinib in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Ibrutinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of MRP1 substrates in HEK293/MRP1 and HL60/Adr cells overexpressing MRP1. Furthermore, ibrutinib increased the accumulation of substrates in these MRP1-overexpressing cells by inhibiting the drug efflux function of MRP1. However, mRNA and protein expression of MRP1 remained unaltered after treatment with ibrutinib in MRP1-overexpressing cells. In vivo, ibrutinib enhanced the efficacy of vincristine to inhibit the growth of HEK293/MRP1 tumour xenografts in nude mice. Importantly, ibrutinib also enhances the cytotoxicity of vincristine in primary cultures of leukaemia blasts, derived from patients. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicated that ibrutinib significantly increased the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agents which were MRP1 substrates, in MRP1-overexpressing cells, in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. These findings will lead to further studies on the effects of a combination of ibrutinib with chemotherapeutic agents in cancer patients overexpressing MRP1.",['(c) 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Zhang, Hui', 'Patel, Atish', 'Ma, Shao-Lin', 'Li, Xiao Jie', 'Zhang, Yun-Kai', 'Yang, Pei-Qi', 'Kathawala, Rishil J', 'Wang, Yi-Jun', 'Anreddy, Nagaraju', 'Fu, Li-Wu', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng']","['Zhang H', 'Patel A', 'Ma SL', 'Li XJ', 'Zhang YK', 'Yang PQ', 'Kathawala RJ', 'Wang YJ', 'Anreddy N', 'Fu LW', 'Chen ZS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/08/29 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bph.12889 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2014 Dec;171(24):5845-57. doi: 10.1111/bph.12889.

RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included, most of whom were male (55%) with a mean age of 58 years (range: 20-83 yrs). The most common underlying malignancies were nine patients with lymphoma (41%), seven with leukemia (32%), and six with solid tumors (27%). Indications for FDX included recurrent CDI in 16 patients (72%) and failure of both metronidazole and oral vancomycin in 6 patients (28%). Nineteen patients (86%) were on concomitant antimicrobials during CDI treatment. Clinical response to FDX was 91%, and overall sustained clinical response was 82%. FDX was well tolerated with no major adverse events that were FDX related or discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events. CONCLUSION: In cancer patients, FDX is effective treatment for the first episode of CDI after failure of standard therapies and treatment of recurrent CDI. This was interesting given the large number of high-risk patients who continued to receive concomitant antimicrobial therapy, which is common in this immunocompromised patient population.","['(c) 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Esmaily-Fard, Amin', 'Tverdek, Frank P', 'Crowther, David M', 'Ghantoji, Shashank S', 'Adachi, Javier A', 'Chemaly, Roy F']","['Esmaily-Fard A', 'Tverdek FP', 'Crowther DM', 'Ghantoji SS', 'Adachi JA', 'Chemaly RF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'Z5N076G8YQ (Fidaxomicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Clostridioides difficile/*drug effects/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/complications/*drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Fidaxomicin', 'Formularies, Hospital as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Texas', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Clostridium difficile', 'cancer', 'fidaxomicin', 'infection', 'recurrence']",2014/08/29 06:00,2015/07/02 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1479 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2014 Nov;34(11):1220-5. doi: 10.1002/phar.1479.

The purpose of this study was to verify the role of the Lp(a) level on cancer among consecutive autopsy cases. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 1354 cases (775 men and 579 women). The average age at death was 79.9 years. Hypolipoproteinemia(a) was defined as an Lp(a) level of below 80 mg/L. Overall, 62.3% of the subjects had suffered from at least one to a maximum of five malignancies throughout their lives. The most frequent type of malignancy was gastric cancer, followed by leukemia, lung cancer, and colon cancer. RESULTS: The cancer-bearing status decreased linearly according to the Lp(a) level in both men and women (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). The median Lp(a) level was significantly lower among the cases with hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers or hematopoietic malignancy, but was higher among cases with lung cancer, especially lung adenocarcinoma. Hypolipoproteinemia(a) was a significant risk factor for any origins of cancer, with an odds ratio of 1.94 (95% CI, 1.45-2.60; P<0.001). It was also a risk factor for hepato-biliary cancers and leukemia, but it was a protective factor for lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested hypolipoproteinemia(a) would be a significant risk factor for cancer except lung cancer. This study complements our previous study showing that hypolipoproteinemia(a) would increase the lifetime risk of cancer other than lung cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

RESULTS: Female dentists from both age strata showed higher risks for breast, colon-rectum, lung, brain, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Compared to physicians and lawyers, higher MOR estimates were observed for brain cancer among female dentists 20-49 yr. Among male dentists, higher cancer mortality was found for colon-rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Higher risk estimates for liver, prostate, bladder, brain, multiple myeloma and leukemia were observed among 50-79 yr old male dentists.

JMML is categorized as an overlap myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) by the World Health Organization and also shares some clinical and molecular features with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a similar disease in adults. Although the current standard of care for patients with JMML relies on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, relapse is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. Tremendous progress has been made in defining the genomic landscape of JMML. Insights from cancer predisposition syndromes have led to the discovery of nearly 90% of driver mutations in JMML, all of which thus far converge on the Ras signaling pathway. This has improved our ability to accurately diagnose patients, develop molecular markers to measure disease burden, and choose therapeutic agents to test in clinical trials.

To address this issue, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry-based mitochondrial signaling assay to systematically investigate mitochondrial/cellular parameters known to be directly impacted by mitochondrial dysfunction: mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level, and cell viability. Modulation of these parameters by a training set of compounds, comprised of established mitochondrial poisons and 60 marketed drugs (30 nM to 1mM), was tested in HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line) cultured in either glucose-supplemented (GSM) or glucose-free (containing galactose/glutamine; GFM) RPMI-1640 media. Post-hoc bio-informatic analyses of IC50 or EC50 values for all parameters tested revealed that MMP depolarization in HL-60 cells cultured in GSM was the most reliable parameter for determining mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells. Disruptors of mitochondrial function depolarized MMP at concentrations lower than those that caused loss of cell viability, especially in cells cultured in GSM; cellular GSH levels correlated more closely to loss of viability in vitro. Some mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors increased mitochondrial ROS generation; however, measuring an increase in ROS alone was not sufficient to identify mitochondrial disruptors. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis of all measured parameters provided confirmation that MMP depletion, without loss of cell viability, was the key signature for identifying mitochondrial disruptors. Subsequent classification of compounds based on ratios of IC50s of cell viability:MMP determined that this parameter is the most critical indicator of mitochondrial health in cells and provides a powerful tool to predict whether novel small molecule entities possess this liability.","['(c) The Author 2014.

We hypothesized that busulfan clearance (BuCL) in older patients (>60 years) would be reduced compared to that in younger patients, potentially explaining observed differences in busulfan tolerability. METHODS: AML patients in three CALGB hematopoietic cell transplantation studies were treated with a conditioning regimen using IV busulfan, dosed at 0.8 mg/kg. Plasma busulfan concentrations were determined by LC-MS and analyzed by non-compartmental methods. BuCL was normalized to actual (ABW), ideal (IBW), or corrected (CBW) body weight (kg). Differences in BuCL between age groups were examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five patients were accrued; 174 provided useable pharmacokinetic data. Twenty-nine patients >/= 60 years old (median 66; range 60-74) had a significantly higher BuCL versus those <60 years old (median 50; range 18-60): BuCL 236 versus 168 mL/min, p = 0.0002; BuCL/ABW 3.0 versus 2.1 mL/min/kg, p = 0.0001; BuCL/IBW 3.8 versus 2.6 mL/min/kg, p = 0.0035; BuCL/CBW 3.4 versus 2.6 mL/min/kg, p = 0.0005. Inter-patient variability in clearance (CV %) was up to 48 % in both age groups. Phenytoin administration, a potential confounder, did not affect BuCL, regardless of weight normalization (p > 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, BuCL was significantly higher in older patients compared to younger patients in these studies and does not explain the previously reported increase in busulfan toxicity observed in older patients.",,"['Beumer, Jan H', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Lewis, Lionel D', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Holleran, Julianne L', 'Christner, Susan M', 'Blum, William', 'Devine, Steven', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Linker, Charles', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Egorin, Merrill J']","['Beumer JH', 'Owzar K', 'Lewis LD', 'Jiang C', 'Holleran JL', 'Christner SM', 'Blum W', 'Devine S', 'Kolitz JE', 'Linker C', 'Vij R', 'Alyea EP', 'Larson RA', 'Ratain MJ', 'Egorin MJ']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Area Under Curve', 'Busulfan/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/blood/pharmacokinetics']",,,2014/08/29 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2013/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2571-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Nov;74(5):927-38. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2571-0.

The purpose of this paper was to explore parent perceptions of (a) parenting in the context of childhood cancer; (b) the parenting strategies used in the context of managing child behavioural side-effects of cancer treatment; and (c) the perceived impact that cancer-specific parenting strategies have on child behaviour. METHODS: Participants were 15 mothers of children aged 2-6 years in the maintenance phase of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the Royal Children's Hospital Children's Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia. Mothers participated in a one-on-one semi-structured telephone interview using an interview guide which included questions on parenting in the context of childhood cancer, specifically in relation to behavioural side-effects (problems with behaviour, sleep and eating) and any perceived impact cancer-specific parenting may have on the ill child. RESULTS: Many parents reported that following their child's cancer diagnosis, they had to implement a suite of 'new' strategies that 'pre-diagnosis' were used only in moderation, if at all. The most salient theme that emerged was parents' perception that their parenting became more lax since their child's diagnosis. Parents further reported specific parenting strategies for each of the main child behavioural side-effects of cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Data from the current qualitative exploratory study highlight the role of specific parenting strategies in managing or assisting child behavioural side-effects of cancer treatment. Further quantitative research is needed to more fully examine the association between parenting and child behavioural outcomes in order to develop modifiable approaches to improving child behavioural side-effects in a paediatric oncology context.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Williams, L K', 'McCarthy, M C']","['Williams LK', 'McCarthy MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders/etiology/*therapy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parenting', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Sleep']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'oncology', 'paediatric', 'parenting', 'psycho-oncology']",2014/08/29 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cch.12188 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2015 Jul;41(4):611-9. doi: 10.1111/cch.12188.

Because these life-threatening and disabling diseases are not yet curable, it is important to prevent new HTLV-1 infections. FINDINGS: In this study, we have established a simple humanized mouse model of HTLV-1 infection for evaluating prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. In this model, HTLV-1-negative normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are transplanted directly into the spleens of severely immunodeficient NOD-SCID/gammacnull (NOG) mice, together with mitomycin-treated HTLV-1-producing T cells. Using this model, we tested the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to HTLV-1 as well as human IgG isolated from HAM/TSP patients (HAM-IgG) in preventing HTLV-1-infection. One hour before and 24 h after transplantation of the human cells, each antibody sample was inoculated intraperitoneally. On day 14, human PBMCs isolated from the mouse spleens were tested for HTLV-1 infection. Whereas fresh CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells isolated from untreated mice or mice treated with isotype control mAb, HTLV-1 non-neutralizing mAbs to envelope gp46, gag p19, and normal human IgG were all infected with HTLV-1; the mice treated with either HTLV-1 neutralizing anti-gp46 mAb or HAM-IgG did not become infected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the neutralizing function of the antibody, but not the antigen specificity, is essential for preventing the in vivo transmission of HTLV-1. The present animal model will also be useful for the in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of candidate molecules to be used as prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Saito, Mineki', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Fujii, Hideki', 'Kodama, Akira', 'Takahashi, Yoshiaki', 'Matsuzaki, Toshio', 'Takashima, Hiroshi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu']","['Saito M', 'Tanaka R', 'Fujii H', 'Kodama A', 'Takahashi Y', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Takashima H', 'Tanaka Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology']",,,2014/08/29 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2014/08/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['s12977-014-0074-z [pii]', '10.1186/s12977-014-0074-z [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2014 Aug 28;11:74. doi: 10.1186/s12977-014-0074-z.,11,10.1186/s12977-014-0074-z [doi],,PMC4180130,,20140828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells express high levels of integrins that are of importance in homing to inflamed tissues. In this study, we investigated DSCs as a cellular therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD), a severe complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Subsequent to transplantation, three patients developed severe extensive cGvHD and were treated with DSCs (1-2.8 x 10(6) cells/kg). One-third of the DSCs administered to two patients were labeled with (111)Indium, and the in vivo distribution was tracked for 48 h. The (111)In-labeled DSCs were initially located in the lungs, followed by dissemination to the liver and spleen. The DSCs induced a partial response in two of the patients. Blood samples from the patients were extensively evaluated by flow cytometry, luminex, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The nonresponder had the highest proportion of T-cells with Th17 and Th2 phenotypes and the highest median plasma concentrations of IL-17 and IL-4. The same patient also had high frequencies of HLA-DR(+) T-cells and regulatory T-cells. To conclude, DSCs are safe to infuse with no adverse effects. We determined how stromal cells are distributed in vivo after infusion in a cGvHD setting.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6)-type cytokines are involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and axon regrowth; thus, they may play a role in the regeneration of zebrafish RGCs after injury. In this study, we assessed the expression of IL-6-type cytokines and found that one of them, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), is upregulated in zebrafish RGCs at 3 days post-injury (dpi). We then demonstrated the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a downstream target of LIF, at 3-5 dpi. To determine the function of LIF, we performed a LIF knockdown experiment using LIF-specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (LIF MOs). LIF MOs, which were introduced into zebrafish RGCs via a severed optic nerve, reduced the expression of LIF and abrogated the activation of STAT3 in RGCs after injury. These results suggest that upregulated LIF drives Janus kinase (Jak)/STAT3 signaling in zebrafish RGCs after nerve injury. In addition, the LIF knockdown impaired axon sprouting in retinal explant culture in vitro; reduced the expression of a regeneration-associated molecule, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43); and delayed functional recovery after optic nerve injury in vivo.

This pair of lines is unique in several respects. Their common clonal origin was proven by the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes. The cells were driven to proliferation in vitro by the same indigenous EBV strain. They are phenotypically different and represent subsequent subclones emerging in the CLL population. Furthermore they reflect the clinical progression of the disease. We emphasize that the support for the expression of the EBV encoded growth program is an important differentiation marker of the CLL cells of origin that was shared by the two subclones. It can be surmised that proliferation of EBV carrying cells in vitro, but not in vivo, reflects the efficient surveillance that functions even in the severe leukemic condition. The MEC1 line arose before the aggressive clinical stage from an EBV carrying cell within the subclone that was in the early prolymphocytic transformation stage while the MEC2 line originated one year later, from the subsequent subclone with overt PLL characteristics. At this time the disease was disseminated and the blood lymphocyte count was considerably elevated. The EBV induced proliferation of the MEC cells belonging to the subclones with markers of PLL agrees with earlier reports in which cells of PLL disease were infected in vitro and immortalized to LCL. They prove also that the expression of EBV encoded set of proteins can be determined at the event of infection. This pair of lines is particularly important as they provide in vitro cells that represent the subclonal evolution of the CLL disease.

RESULTS: Only 36% had involvement of all three haematopoietic cell lines, and 23% presented with the classic clinical triad of pallor, fever and purpura. Symptoms of bone marrow insufficiency had been present in 77% for an average of two weeks as a late occurrence following musculoskeletal pains (in 49%, duration eight weeks) and constitutional symptoms (in 82%, duration four weeks). Organ infiltration was manifest in 71%. In 22%, only one or no cell count was abnormal; in this group, musculoskeletal symptoms were more frequent and symptom duration longer (two months versus one month). In 15%, lymphoblasts could not be detected in the blood. At the time of diagnosis, the Danish criteria for accelerated investigation were fulfilled in 98% of cases.

Although a small percentage of older patients may be cured by standard chemotherapy, it is clear that several aspects of frontline management require improvement and novel approaches are urgently needed. This review focuses on treatment options currently available to older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, with an emphasis on new therapeutics. RECENT FINDINGS: Developing risk-assessment tools is critical to identify older patients who are most likely to benefit from intensive chemotherapy, but optimal induction and postremission therapies have yet to be determined in this population. New strategies and treatments are emerging and under current assessment. In particular, investigations of monoclonal antibodies, hypomethylating agents, signal transduction inhibitors, and novel cytotoxics hold promise for improving outcomes in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, including those for whom traditional chemotherapy is not considered appropriate.

For example, deletion of human lymphoid nuclear protein related to AF4/AFF member 3 (LAF4/AFF3) is known to cause severe neurodevelopmental defects, and silencing of the gene is also associated with ID at the folate-sensitive fragile site (FSFS) FRA2A; yet the normal function of this gene in the nervous system is unclear. The aim of this study was to further investigate the function of Laf4 in the brain by focusing on its role in the cortex. By manipulating expression levels in organotypic slices, we demonstrate here that Laf4 is required for normal cellular migration in the developing cortex and have subsequently identified Mdga2, an important structural protein in neurodevelopment, as a target of Laf4 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we show that the migration deficit caused by loss of Laf4 can be partially rescued by Mdga2 over-expression, revealing an important functional relationship between these genes. Our study demonstrates the key transcriptional role of Laf4 during early brain development and reveals a novel function for the gene in the process of cortical cell migration relevant to the haploinsufficiency and silencing observed in human neurodevelopmental disorders.",,"['Moore, Justin M', 'Oliver, Peter L', 'Finelli, Mattea J', 'Lee, Sheena', 'Lickiss, Tom', 'Molnar, Zoltan', 'Davies, Kay E']","['Moore JM', 'Oliver PL', 'Finelli MJ', 'Lee S', 'Lickiss T', 'Molnar Z', 'Davies KE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Laf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (MDGA2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Movement', 'Cerebral Cortex/growth & development/*metabolism/pathology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microtomy', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/genetics', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2014/08/28 06:00,2015/11/07 06:00,['2014/08/28 06:00'],"['2014/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0105933 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-10497 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 27;9(8):e105933. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0105933. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0105933 [doi],"['MRC Functional Genomics Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Functional Genomics Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Functional Genomics Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Functional Genomics Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",PMC4146563,,20140827,,,,,"['084655/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0900901/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137761449/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12021/2/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, derivation of NK-like cells from more abundant cell sources such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) requires the selection of rare CD34+ cells. Thus, we sought to convert adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which are abundant and natively CD34+, into NK-like cells. When grown in hematopoietic induction medium, ADSCs formed sphere clusters and expressed hematopoietic markers CD34, CD45, and KDR. Further induction in NK cell-specific medium resulted in a population of cells that expressed NK cell marker CD56, and thus termed ADSC-NK. Alternatively, the hematopoietically induced ADSCs were transduced with NK cell-specific transcription factor E4BP4 prior to induction in NK cell-specific medium. This latter population of cells, termed ADSC-NKE, expressed CD56 and additional NK cell markers such as CD16, CD94, CD158, CD314, FasL, and NKp46. ADSC-NKE was as potent as NK leukemia cell NKL in killing breast cancer cell MCF7 and prostate cancer cells DU145, PC3, LnCap, DuPro, C4-2 and CWR22, but exhibited no killing activity toward normal endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In nude mice test ADSC-NKE was able to significantly delay the progression of tumors formed by MCF7 and PC3. When injected into immunocompetent rats, ADSC-NKE was detectable in bone marrow and spleen for at least 5 weeks. Together, these results suggest that ADSCs can be converted into NK-like cells with anti-tumor activities.",,"['Ning, Hongxiu', 'Lei, Hong-En', 'Xu, Yong-De', 'Guan, Rui-Li', 'Venstrom, Jeffrey M', 'Lin, Guiting', 'Lue, Tom F', 'Xin, Zhongcheng', 'Lin, Ching-Shwun']","['Ning H', 'Lei HE', 'Xu YD', 'Guan RL', 'Venstrom JM', 'Lin G', 'Lue TF', 'Xin Z', 'Lin CS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NFIL3 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1/genetics/immunology', 'Plasmids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/immunology']",,,2014/08/28 06:00,2015/11/07 06:00,['2014/08/28 06:00'],"['2014/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0106246 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-14414 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 27;9(8):e106246. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106246. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0106246 [doi],"['Knuppe Molecular Urology Laboratory, Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Andrology Center, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Andrology Center, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Andrology Center, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Knuppe Molecular Urology Laboratory, Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Knuppe Molecular Urology Laboratory, Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Andrology Center, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Knuppe Molecular Urology Laboratory, Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",PMC4146612,,20140827,,,,,"['DK069655/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK045370/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK64538/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK069655/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 DK064538/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK045370/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK045370/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

XIAP is frequently overexpressed in human leukemia and prostate and breast tumors. Inhibition of apoptosis by XIAP is mainly coordinated through direct binding to the initiator caspase-9 via its baculovirus-IAP-repeat-3 (BIR3) domain. XIAP inhibits caspases directly making it to an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. In the search for novel, non-peptidic XIAP inhibitors in this study we focused on the chemical constituents of sang bai pi (mulberry root bark). Most promising candidates of this plant were tested biochemically in vitro by a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay and in vivo via protein fragment complementation analysis (PCA). We identified the Diels Alder adduct Sanggenon G (SG1) as a novel, small-molecular weight inhibitor of XIAP. As shown by FP and PCA analyses, SG1 binds specifically to the BIR3 domain of XIAP with a binding affinity of 34.26 muM. Treatment of the transgenic leukemia cell line Molt3/XIAP with SG1 enhances caspase-8, -3 and -9 cleavage, displaces caspase-9 from XIAP as determined by immunoprecipitation experiments and sensitizes these cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. SG1 not only sensitizes the XIAP-overexpressing leukemia cell line Molt3/XIAP to etoposide treatment but also different neuroblastoma cell lines endogenously expressing high XIAP levels.

In here we described cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) in 12-year-old male patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who was on maintenance phase therapy. Methods. He was referred to our clinic for seeing of spots with the right eye for 3 days. At presentation, his best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the anterior chamber of the left eye was within normal limits, whereas we observed 3+ anterior chamber cellular reaction in the right eye. On retinal examination, we found active retinitis lesions (cream-colored lesions associated with hemorrhages) and perivascular cuffing in the retinal periphery in the right eye. Left eye was normal. Results. On the basis of clinical picture, we made the diagnosis of CMVR in the right eye. Vitreous aspiration was performed and 23096 copies/mL of CMV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous ganciclovir for two weeks and discharged with oral valganciclovir prophylaxis. Conclusion. CMVR should be in mind in children with ALL on maintenance phase therapy even in those without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was done to determine the percentage of platelet alloimmunisation due to platelet-reactive antibodies in 340 patients with hematologic or oncologic diseases who had received multiple transfusions (> 10) of blood and blood components and showed platelet refractoriness in 1-hour post transfusion sample. RESULTS: Platelet-reactive antibodies were detected in the sera of 127 out of 340 patients (37.35%) who received multiple transfusions (> 10) and showed platelet refractoriness. CONCLUSION: Platelet-reactive antibodies appear to be an important cause of platelet refractoriness in patients of acute leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, NHL, MDS and multiple myeloma receiving multiple platelet transfusions. Platelet refractoriness in patients of ITP and chronic leukaemia appears to be due to other causes and not due to platelet-reactive antibodies.",,"['Agarwal, Nitin', 'Chatterjee, Kabita', 'Sen, Alok', 'Kumar, Praveen']","['Agarwal N', 'Chatterjee K', 'Sen A', 'Kumar P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Asian J Transfus Sci,Asian journal of transfusion science,101306858,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Platelet alloimmunization', 'platelet immunofluorescent test', 'refractoriness']",2014/08/28 06:00,2014/08/28 06:01,['2014/08/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-6247.137453 [doi]', 'AJTS-8-126 [pii]']",ppublish,Asian J Transfus Sci. 2014 Jul;8(2):126-7. doi: 10.4103/0973-6247.137453.,8,10.4103/0973-6247.137453 [doi],"['Department of Transfusion Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Armed Force Transfusion Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",PMC4140056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic pathways that regulated cell lineage fate during the development of APL remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated the correlations of miR-146a expression with its target gene Smad4 and the biological behaviors of NB4 cells. We also analyzed their expression in clinical samples from APL patients. RESULTS: miR-146a influenced apoptosis and proliferation in NB4 cells. miR-146a influenced endogenous Smad4 protein levels in APL cells. miR-146a expression levels were positively correlated with white cell counts and PML/RARalpha fusion protein expression. miR-146a expression levels were negatively correlated with Smad4 protein and the helper T cell (Th)/the suppressor T cell (Ts) ratio in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that miR-146a played an important role in the development of APL in part through the repression on Smad4 protein expression. miR-146a functioned as an oncogene and may be a novel prognostic biomarker in APL.",,"['Xu, Lan', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Wan, Haixia', 'Chen, Fang-yuan', 'Zhong, Jihua', 'Xiao, Fei', 'Liu, Jia', 'Shen, Lijing']","['Xu L', 'Zhong H', 'Wan H', 'Chen FY', 'Zhong J', 'Xiao F', 'Liu J', 'Shen L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (SMAD4 protein, human)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Smad4 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/metabolism/physiology']",,,2014/08/28 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2014/08/28 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/150604 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Markers. 2014;2014:150604. doi: 10.1155/2014/150604.

Adult and pediatric patients who had first undergone myeloablative-unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome between 1999 and 2011 were included. All had high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Of the total (n = 8003), cases were 8/8 (n = 5449), 7/8 (n = 2071), or 6/8 (n = 483) matched. HLA mismatch (6-7/8) conferred significantly increased risk for grades II to IV and III to IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall mortality compared with HLA-matched cases (8/8). Type (allele/antigen) and locus (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1) of mismatch were not associated with overall mortality. Among 8/8 matched cases, HLA-DPB1 and -DQB1 mismatch resulted in increased acute GVHD, and HLA-DPB1 mismatch had decreased relapse. Nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 allele mismatch was associated with higher TRM compared with permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch or HLA-DPB1 match and increased overall mortality compared with permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch in 8/8 (and 10/10) matched cases.

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study of the impact of baseline clinical factors, induction therapy, and stem cell transplant (SCT) on the outcomes of 311 patients with previously untreated DHL. At median follow-up of 23 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates among all patients were 10.9 and 21.9 months, respectively. Forty percent of patients remain disease-free and 49% remain alive at 2 years. Intensive induction was associated with improved PFS, but not OS, and SCT was not associated with improved OS among patients achieving first complete remission (P = .14). By multivariate analysis, advanced stage, central nervous system involvement, leukocytosis, and LDH >3 times the upper limit of normal were associated with higher risk of death.

New methods are required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical features of drugs against the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models. RESULTS: In this article, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on genome-wide gene expression across several cancer cell lines [Connectivity Map (CMap) database]. The task is formulated as searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared effects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible. The components can be computed with an extension of a recent approach called Group Factor Analysis. We identify 11 components that link the structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression responses observed in the three cell lines and identify structural groups that may be responsible for the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the limited earlier methods on CMap and identifies both the previously reported associations and several interesting novel findings, by taking into account multiple cell lines and advanced 3D structural descriptors. The novel observations include: previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by 15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific response, resembling the effects of corticosteroids.

Chromosome instability and DNA repair defects are the cellular characteristics used for the clinical diagnosis. However, these biological defects are not sufficient to explain all the clinical phenotype of FA patients. The known defects are structural alteration in cell cytoskeleton, altered structural organization for intermediate filaments, nuclear lamina, and mitochondria. These are associated with different expression and/or maturation of the structural proteins vimentin, mitofilin, and lamin A/C suggesting the involvement of metalloproteinases (MPs). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are involved in normal physiological processes such as human skeletal tissue development, maturation, and hematopoietic reconstitution after bone marrow suppression. Current observations upon the eventual role of MPs in FA cells are largely inconclusive. We evaluated the overall MPs activity in FA complementation group A (FANCA) cells by exposing them to the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and resveratrol (RV). This work supports the hypothesis that treatment of Fanconi patients with antioxidants may be important in FA therapy.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.']","['Ravera, Silvia', 'Capanni, Cristina', 'Tognotti, Danika', 'Bottega, Roberta', 'Columbaro, Marta', 'Dufour, Carlo', 'Cappelli, Enrico', 'Degan, Paolo']","['Ravera S', 'Capanni C', 'Tognotti D', 'Bottega R', 'Columbaro M', 'Dufour C', 'Cappelli E', 'Degan P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IMMT protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomal Instability/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fanconi Anemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Metalloproteases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*growth & development/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",,,2014/08/28 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/08/28 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24778 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2015 Mar;230(3):603-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24778.,230,10.1002/jcp.24778 [doi],"['DIFAR-Biochemistry Lab., Department of Pharmacology, University of Genova, Genova, Italy.']",,,,,,,,['GTB12001/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient selection was based on MGMT expression by Western blot. Patients with MGMT:ACTB (beta-actin) ratio <0.2 were eligible to receive temozolomide 200 mg/m(2) /d x7 d. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) could receive up to 12 monthly cycles of temozolomide x5/28 d. Of 166 patients screened, 81 (49%) demonstrated low MGMT expression; 45 of these were treated with temozolomide. The overall response rate was 53%; 36% achieved complete clearance of blasts, with 27% achieving a CR/CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). Factors associated with a trend toward a higher response rate included MDS, methylated MGMT promoter and standard cytogenetic risk group. Induction and post-remission cycles were well-tolerated and most patients were treated on an outpatient basis.

METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional nationwide survey using a self-administered questionnaire. The prefecture with the lowest student population was set to 1, and that with the highest student population was set to 18 for elementary schools and 19 for junior high and high schools based on the ratio of the student population. In this way, 213 elementary schools, 222 junior high schools, and 208 high schools were selected from all 47 prefectures in Japan, and questionnaires were sent to each school. The questionnaire listed the names of 15 cancers and asked respondents to choose one answer from three: ""Never heard of,"" ""Heard of/Don't understand,"" or ""Heard of/Understand."" RESULTS: Response rates for schools were 44.1 % (n = 94) for elementary schools, 46.4 % (n = 103) for junior high schools, and 55.8 % (n = 116) for high schools. A total of 8,876 questionnaires were used for the analysis. Our survey suggests that the most commonly understood types of cancer differed by grade, with lung cancer the most commonly understood in elementary school, leukemia in junior high schools, and breast cancer in high schools. Girls tended to demonstrate greater cancer understanding than boys, with particularly large differences by gender in rates of understanding of breast and uterine cancer at each assessed grade level. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we examined Japanese primary and secondary school students. Marked differences in cancer recognition by grade and gender suggest that educational efforts are needed at various grade levels and gender-specific cancer education. Further, more than 50 % of students at any school level were not familiar with most cancers.

RECENT FINDINGS: CMV seropositivity of the recipient is still a negative factor for transplant outcome. The use of a CMV seropositive donor has a negative impact on survival in patients receiving unrelated but not human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling grafts. In CMV seropositive patients, the donor serological status influences outcome in patients receiving unrelated donor grafts after myeloablative but not reduced-intensity conditioning. Early CMV replication reduces the risk for leukemia relapse but does not improve survival. The use of leukocyte depleted blood products is sufficient to prevent primary CMV infection.

The present study investigated ELF-MFs effect on nerve growth factor (NGF) induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells using proteomic applications to understand its role in the enhancement of neuronal differentiation. After 50 Hz, 1 mT ELF-MFs 5-day exposure on NGF induced PC12 cells, it was observed to increase neurite length as well as an increase in the number of neurite bearing cells. It was also discovered that there was a decrease in proliferation activity, which is associated with an increase in differentiated cells. Neuronal differentiation related mRNA levels and protein levels were increased in NGF induced PC12 cells. Compared with NGF induced group, ELF-MFs stimulated PC12 cells had different protein expression as measured with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels. Consequently six differentially expressed spots were detected between the 2-DE maps, which were identified by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF LC/MS/MS) as: peripherin, neurosecretory protein nerve growth factor inducible (VGF8a) precursor, dnaK-type molecular chaperone sp72-ps1 (HSP72-psI), low molecular weight (Mr) phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase isoenzyme AcP1 (LMW-PTP/ACP1), Tubulin alpha-1A (TUBA1A) chain, outcome predictor in acute leukemia 1 homolog (OPA1L). The identification of these proteins provides clues to the mechanism of ELF-MFs stimulation on NGF induced PC12 cells that occur during neuronal differentiation and may contribute to the development novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

The mode of action of decitabine strictly depends on the incorporation of the drug into DNA. However, DNA incorporation and ensuing genotoxic effects of decitabine have not yet been investigated in human cancer cell lines or in models related to the approved indication of the drug. Here we describe a robust assay for the quantitative determination of decitabine incorporation rates into DNA from human cancer cells. Using a panel of human myeloid leukemia cell lines we show appreciable amounts of decitabine incorporation that closely correlated with cellular drug uptake. Decitabine incorporation was also detectable in primary cells from myeloid leukemia patients, indicating that the assay is suitable for biomarker analyses to predict drug responses in patients. Finally, we also used next-generation sequencing to comprehensively analyze the effects of decitabine incorporation on the DNA sequence level. Interestingly, this approach failed to reveal significant changes in the rates of point mutations and genome rearrangements in myeloid leukemia cell lines. These results indicate that standard rates of decitabine incorporation are not genotoxic in myeloid leukemia cells.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014.

Living cells were measured using flow cytometry, by counting propidium iodide-negative cells either CD5(+) (MOLT-3) or CD55(+) (HeLa). We developed a mathematical model to take into account possible interactions between cells and among cells and their environmental niches. Model equations were then fitted to growth data. RESULTS: Ecological interactions that require direct cell contact and indirect mechanisms acting on cell niches, successfully modelled cell population growth.

Its molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood, except for the role of germline RUNX1 mutations. Here we show that CDC25C mutations are frequently found in FPD/AML patients (53%). Mutated CDC25C disrupts the G2/M checkpoint and promotes cell cycle progression even in the presence of DNA damage, suggesting a critical role for CDC25C in malignant transformation in FPD/AML. The predicted hierarchical architecture shows that CDC25C mutations define a founding pre-leukaemic clone, followed by stepwise acquisition of subclonal mutations that contribute to leukaemia progression. In three of seven individuals with CDC25C mutations, GATA2 is the target of subsequent mutation. Thus, CDC25C is a novel gene target identified in haematological malignancies.

Our results showed that for blood and marrow aspirate samples, both HRM and ASP had a very high analytical sensitivity (1%) in clinical specimens and excellent diagnostic sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) in analysable samples. Sanger sequencing had a lower analytical sensitivity (4%), resulting in false-negative analysis in samples with a low tumour cell percentage. High resolution melting was technically the simplest and had the shortest turn-around time (2 hours). Analysis of decalcified trephine biopsies was more difficult because of suboptimal DNA preservation. Although Sanger sequencing was least demanding on sample DNA quality for a successful analysis, none of the three techniques showed satisfactory diagnostic performance on trephine biopsies.

METHODS: Occlusion of the cerebral artery was accomplished via the intraluminal filament, followed by the TTC staining evaluation and neurological deficit score. Meanwhile, the blood serum was extracted at 0.5, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours and 3 and 7 days after surgery. The serum expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Hsp70 were determined using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's protocols. Expression correlations between Bcl-2 and Hsp70, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were analysed using correl function. A rats model was successfully established. RESULTS: The expression of all three indexes, including Bcl-2, caspase-3 and Hsp70, was significantly increased after surgery (p < 0.05) and peaked at 12, 24 and 24 hours, respectively. Up to 7 days after MCAO, the expression levels of these proteins recovered to the control levels. There were positive correlations between the expressions of Bcl-2 and Hsp70, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 (p < 0.05).

We evaluated the performance of the AlleleSEQR Chimerism Assay, which is based on quantitative real-time PCR of biallelic indel markers, using 79 recipient-donor pairs. When the informativeness of the screening panel composed of 34 markers was determined using 130 unrelated individuals, it presented a >99.9% probability of selecting at least one informative marker. The analytic sensitivity of the indel marker assay was estimated using a serially diluted DNA mixture. The detection limit of the quantitative assay approached 0.024% when 250 ng of DNA was used. We used 175 samples that had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to compare the quantitative real-time PCR assay with short tandem repeat quantitation. Results from the AlleleSEQR Chimerism Assay showed excellent correlation with those from the short tandem repeat method (r(2) = 0.931). Moreover, in some patients with relapsed leukemia, the AlleleSEQR Chimerism Assay was able to detect an early increase in recipient DNA levels that was undetectable using the short tandem repeat method. The indel marker-based AlleleSEQR Chimerism Assay can be a useful tool for following up patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation because of its high sensitivity compared with the conventional short tandem repeat method.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

However, it is poorly understood how the VEGF-C signaling modulates the immune functions in the tumor microenvironment. We have previously reported that natural killer (NK) cells in AML patients strongly upregulated VEGFR-3, the major VEGF-C receptor, and that the VEGFR-3 expression level in NK cells inversely correlates with their cytotoxic potential. These findings have led us to hypothesize that VEGFR-3 inhibition may reinstate the cytotoxic capacity of the AML-associated NK cells. To address this hypothesis, we employed a pharmaceutical approach to block the VEGFR-3 function in the murine model of syngeneic myelogenous leukemia. Using various molecular and cellular analyses, we assessed the correlation between VEGFR-3 inhibition and NK cell cytotoxicity. Indeed, we found that leukemic environment is highly enriched with lymphangiogenic stimuli, and that VEGFR-3 inhibition restored NK cell killing function with an increased IFN-gamma level, providing a therapeutic implication of VEGFR-3 against AML. Together, we demonstrate the therapeutic value of functional modulation of NK cells by blocking VEGFR-3, and provide a possibility of advanced therapeutic approaches using immune cells against myelogenous leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Because of the possibility of the enzyme inactivation by antibodies, monitoring of ASP activity is essential. The aim of the study was to examine if plasma concentration of ammonia, a direct product of the reaction catalyzed by ASP, can be used in the assessment of ASP activity. A group of 87 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated in the Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology in Krakow was enrolled to the study. ASP activity and ammonia concentration were measured after ASP administrations during induction. A positive correlation was found between the ammonia concentration and ASP activity (R = 0.44; P < 0.0001) and between the medium values of ammonia concentration and ASP activity (R = 0.56; P < 0.0001).

Previously we have shown that Prep1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that inhibits neoplastic transformation by competing with myeloid ecotropic integration site 1 for binding to the common heterodimeric partner Pbx1. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is controlled by complex networks of proinvasive transcription factors responsive to paracrine factors such as TGF-beta. Here we show that, in addition to inhibiting primary tumor growth, PREP1 is a novel EMT inducer and prometastatic transcription factor. In human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, PREP1 overexpression is sufficient to trigger EMT, whereas PREP1 down-regulation inhibits the induction of EMT in response to TGF-beta. PREP1 modulates the cellular sensitivity to TGF-beta by inducing the small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3) nuclear translocation through mechanisms dependent, at least in part, on PREP1-mediated transactivation of a regulatory element in the SMAD3 first intron. Along with the stabilization and accumulation of PBX1, PREP1 induces the expression of multiple activator protein 1 components including the proinvasive Fos-related antigen 1 (FRA-1) oncoprotein. Both FRA-1 and PBX1 are required for the mesenchymal changes triggered by PREP1 in lung tumor cells. Finally, we show that the PREP1-induced mesenchymal transformation correlates with significantly increased lung colonization by cells overexpressing PREP1. Accordingly, we have detected PREP1 accumulation in a large number of human brain metastases of various solid tumors, including NSCLC. These findings point to a novel role of the PREP1 homeoprotein in the control of the TGF-beta pathway, EMT, and metastasis in NSCLC.",,"['Risolino, Maurizio', 'Mandia, Nadia', 'Iavarone, Francescopaolo', 'Dardaei, Leila', 'Longobardi, Elena', 'Fernandez, Serena', 'Talotta, Francesco', 'Bianchi, Fabrizio', 'Pisati, Federica', 'Spaggiari, Lorenzo', 'Harter, Patrick N', 'Mittelbronn, Michel', 'Schulte, Dorothea', 'Incoronato, Mariarosaria', 'Di Fiore, Pier Paolo', 'Blasi, Francesco', 'Verde, Pasquale']","['Risolino M', 'Mandia N', 'Iavarone F', 'Dardaei L', 'Longobardi E', 'Fernandez S', 'Talotta F', 'Bianchi F', 'Pisati F', 'Spaggiari L', 'Harter PN', 'Mittelbronn M', 'Schulte D', 'Incoronato M', 'Di Fiore PP', 'Blasi F', 'Verde P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (fos-related antigen 1)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Adenocarcinoma of Lung', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/pathology/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Smad3 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['PTGFbeta', 'TALE proteins']",2014/08/27 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1407074111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1407074111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 9;111(36):E3775-84. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1407074111.

The anemia worsened as time went on, and the patient became transfusion dependent.

Altered expression of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53, may also attenuate normal p53 signaling, thereby enhancing tumor transformation and resistance to apoptosis. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 309 has been reported to increase MDM2 expression and impair normal p53 response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the frequency and impact of TP53 mutations (TP53mut) and MDM2(SNP309) on treatment outcome and overall survival (OS) in 189 Swedish acute myeloid leukemia patients. The genetic analyses were performed using SSCA and direct sequencing (for mutations in exon 5-8 of TP53) and Pyrosequencing (for the MDM2(SNP309) ). RESULTS: We found a high frequency (22%) of TP53mut in patients with cytogenetic aberrations, with association to high-risk cytogenetics (P < 0.001). TP53mut patients had lower response rates (22% compared with 76% CR in TP53 wild-type (wt) patients, P < 0.001) and reduced OS (2 and 16 months, respectively, P < 0.001). In TP53wt patients with high or intermediate risk cytogenetic aberrations, the MDM2(SNP309) conferred an impaired outcome, with patients carrying the alternative G-allele having shorter OS compared with T/T patients (median 9 vs. 50 months, P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TP53mut analysis and MDM2(SNP309) genotyping may be useful tools for prognostication, risk stratification, and selection of patients most likely to benefit from new drugs targeting the p53 signaling pathway.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the cellular basis underlying this strong association remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that leukemic B cells from patients with CLL recognize the erythrocyte protein Band 3, a prevalent autoantigen in AHA. Here we show that the major binding site of Band 3 on leukemic cells is an extrinsic protein identified as high-mobility group nucleosome binding protein 2 (HMGN2), a nucleosome-interacting factor which has not been previously reported at the cell surface. T lymphocytes do not express HMGN2 or bind Band 3. Removal of HMGN2 from the cell membrane abrogated the capacity of Band 3-pulsed CLL cells to induce CD4 + T cell proliferation.

YKS has also been reported to be effective on inhibiting the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. As known, the release of various chemical mediators including histamine from degranulated mast cells is strongly related to the mechanism of these diseases. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine the mechanisms behind the medicinal effects of YKS on mast cells using an in vitro system and rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The degree of degranulation was measured by beta-hexosaminidase secretion assay and intracellular calcium influx assay. ELISA for cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-4) was also conducted using cell culture media. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of YKS on the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) and cytokine production (IL-8) in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells using gene-transcriptional- and immunohisotoligical analysis. We found that YKS inhibited secretion of beta-hexosaminidase, intracellular calcium increase, production of TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 expression, and that several YKS ingredients may be the key effectors. In conclusion, YKS may suppress several mast cell functions such as degranulation and calcium increase that eventually inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, YKS suppresses ICAM-1 expression on human microvascular endothelial cells. These findings may promote our understanding of the beneficial effects of YKS on mast cell-associated allergic diseases.",['(c) 2014 Japanese Dermatological Association.'],"['Yamamura, Kazuhiko', 'Kato, Shiori', 'Kato, Takahiro A', 'Mizoguchi, Yoshito', 'Monji, Akira', 'Kanba, Shigenobu', 'Furue, Masutaka', 'Takeuchi, Satoshi']","['Yamamura K', 'Kato S', 'Kato TA', 'Mizoguchi Y', 'Monji A', 'Kanba S', 'Furue M', 'Takeuchi S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Yi-Gan San)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Basophil Degranulation Test', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['allergy', 'herbal medicine', 'mast cells', 'urticaria', 'yokukansan']",2014/08/27 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.12578 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2014 Sep;41(9):808-14. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.12578.

Since Notch signaling contributes to the leukemia cell survival and growth, targeting Notch signaling using gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) has been proposed as a molecularly targeted therapy for the treatment of T-ALL. However, not all T-ALL with NOTCH1 activating mutations respond to GSI treatment. We examined whether GSI could enhance the cytotoxic effect of anti-leukemic agents in the GSI-resistant T-ALL cells although GSI does not have anti-tumor effect as a single agent. GSI significantly increased cell death induced by Vincristine (VCR) but not other anti-leukemic drugs (Methotrexate, Asparaginase, and Cytarabine). The GSI effect in enhancing VCR efficacy was not the result of inhibition of Notch signaling. GSI augmented VCR-induced mitotic arrest, followed by apoptosis. GSI accelerated VCR-triggered loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-mediated apoptosis. Our finding suggests that GSI has other functions besides inhibiting Notch signaling in T-ALL and incorporating GSI into the conventional regimen containing VCR may offer therapeutic advantage by potentiating VCR treatment in leukemia patients.",,"['Yoon, Sun-Ok', 'Zapata, Mariana C', 'Singh, Akannsha', 'Jo, Wol Soon', 'Spencer, Nakia', 'Choi, Yong Sung']","['Yoon SO', 'Zapata MC', 'Singh A', 'Jo WS', 'Spencer N', 'Choi YS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)alanyl)phenylglycine tert-butyl ester)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",,,2014/08/27 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-014-1029-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2014 Nov;19(11):1616-26. doi: 10.1007/s10495-014-1029-5.,19,10.1007/s10495-014-1029-5 [doi],"['Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, 1514 Jefferson Highway, New Orleans, 70121, LA, USA, syoon75@gmail.com.']",PMC4198427,,,,,,,"['P20GM103501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20GM103518/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA121039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103518/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR021970/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS623497'],,,,,,,,,

Necrosis was observed only at the highest tested concentration (4 muM). Compound 1 interfered with the cell cycle, causing an accumulation of cells in the G1 /G0 phase. Interaction of 1 with dsDNA and ssDNA was observed by differential pulse voltammetry and confirmed by hyperchromicity in the UV/Vis spectra of dsDNA, with an interaction constant of 2x10(4) M(-1). Both the organic analogue 1,1,2-triphenylbut-1-ene (2) and ferrocene were inactive against cancer and noncancer cell lines and did not react with DNA.

The overall IR of cancer in the United States is declining. Although central nervous system tumors (CNST) are rare, they contribute disproportionately to mortality and morbidity. In this analysis, the authors examined trends in the incidence of the most common cancers and CNST between 2000 and 2010. METHODS: The current analysis used data from the United States Cancer Statistics publication and the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States. Age-adjusted IR per 100,000 population with 95% confidence intervals and the annual percent change (APC) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for selected common cancers and CNST overall and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, selected histologies, and malignancy status. RESULTS: In adults, there were significant decreases in colon (2000-2010: APC, -3.1), breast (2000-2010: APC, -0.8), lung (2000-2010: APC, -1.1), and prostate (2000-2010: APC, -2.4) cancer as well as malignant CNST (2008-2010: APC, -3.1), but a significant increase was noted in nonmalignant CNST (2004-2010: APC, 2.7). In adolescents, there were significant increases in malignant CNST (2000-2008: APC, 1.0) and nonmalignant CNST (2004-2010: APC, 3.9). In children, there were significant increases in acute lymphocytic leukemia (2000-2010: APC, 1.0), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2000-2010: APC, 0.6), and malignant CNST (2000-2010: APC, 0.6).

We have previously reported a relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1, encoding the multi-drug transporter P-glycoprotein, and overall survival (OS) in normal karyotype (NK)-AML. Here we extended this material, enabling subgroup analysis based on FLT3 and NPM1 status, to further elucidate the influence of ABCB1 SNPs. De novo NK-AML patients (n = 201) were analysed for 1199G>A, 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T, and correlations to outcome were investigated. FLT3 wild-type 1236C/C patients have significantly shorter OS compared to patients carrying the variant allele; medians 20 vs. 49 months, respectively, P = 0.017. There was also an inferior outcome in FLT3 wild-type 2677G/G patients compared to patients carrying the variant allele, median OS 20 vs. 35 months, respectively, P = 0.039. This was confirmed in Cox regression analysis.

The myeloid leukaemias are often preceded by a transient neonatal pre-leukaemic syndrome, Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis (TAM). TAM is caused by cooperation between cT21 and acquired somatic N-terminal truncating mutations in the key haematopoietic transcription factor GATA1. These mutations, which are not leukaemogenic in the absence of cT21, are found in almost one-third of neonates with DS. Analysis of primary human fetal liver haematopoietic cells and of human embryonic stem cells demonstrates that cT21 itself substantially alters human fetal haematopoietic development. Consequently, many haematopoietic developmental defects are observed in neonates with DS even in the absence of TAM. Although studies in mouse models have suggested a pathogenic role of deregulated expression of several chromosome 21-encoded genes, their role in human leukaemogenesis remains unclear. As cT21 exists in all embryonic cells, the molecular basis of cT21-associated leukaemias probably reflects a complex interaction between deregulated gene expression in haematopoietic cells and the fetal haematopoietic microenvironment in DS.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Roberts, Irene', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Roberts I', 'Izraeli S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/metabolism', '*Down Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Preleukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Down syndrome acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'GATA1', 'acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia', 'transient abnormal myelopoiesis', 'trisomy 21']",2014/08/27 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13096 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Dec;167(5):587-99. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13096.

A systematic review was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of adding a thrombopoietin-receptor (THPO-R) agonist to standard MDS treatment. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched. We included randomized controlled trials comparing a THPO-R agonist to placebo. A meta-analysis of the effects was performed. Endpoints included bleeding and platelet transfusion rates, risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and mortality. Three hundred and eighty four patients from five trials were included, four using romiplostim and one using eltrombopag. Overall, the relative risk (RR) of bleeding with romiplostim versus placebo was 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57-1.24]. However, compared to placebo, romiplostim significantly decreased the exposure-adjusted bleeding rate (RR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86-0.99), as well as the exposure-adjusted platelet transfusion rate (RR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53-0.88). The RR of AML progression with romiplostim was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.54-3.40), however the outcome data were judged as higher risk of bias. Romiplostim is promising in its ability to decrease patient-important outcomes: bleeding and platelet transfusion need. Although the risk of AML progression was not increased, due to unclear risk of bias in the data, this safety concern is difficult to assess.

RESULTS: A man with a 12-year history of acute monoblastic leukemia presented with median mononeuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thickened median nerve. Nerve biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leukemic infiltration. Clinical resolution was achieved through local radiation. Only 10 cases of isolated neuroleukemiosis have been reported. Most were in remission from leukemia. Our patient is the only one who was considered clinically cured of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The presumed pathophysiology of isolated neuroleukemiosis is hematogenous spread of leukemic cells into the peripheral nervous system across the blood-nerve barrier.

IDH mutation has been found to be an inciting event in gliomagenesis and to have a profound effect on the molecular and genetic route of oncogenic progression and on clinical outcome. OBJECTIVES: To review the role of IDH enzymes in normal physiology and describe aberrations in the IDH pathway that are associated with gliomagenesis, to review recent work examining the effect of IDH-targeted therapy in cancers harboring IDH mutation, and to determine how this work has expanded our understanding of the role of IDH in the development and progression of glioma. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic review of the literature dating from 2008, when IDH mutation was discovered to be clinically significant in glioma, to 2013 was performed using the PubMed database. The following search terms were used: IDH, IDH1, IDH2, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, in conjunction with glioma or leukemia. The search was limited to articles published in English. Further hand searching was performed using a review of the pertinent references from the identified publications. All identified original articles were investigated for content and critiqued by Z.T. and S.D. FINDINGS: IDH mutation is an early event in gliomagenesis and has significant implications for glioma progression and tumor behavior. Early evidence suggests that IDH may be a therapeutic target in IDH-mutant gliomas.

It is unknown whether weekend diagnostic admissions in pediatric patients with leukemia demonstrate similar adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate adverse clinical outcomes associated with weekend admission in the first hospitalization of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed leukemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study from 1999 to 2011 featured index hospital admissions identified from the Pediatric Health Information System database. Participants were children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoid leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. EXPOSURES: Weekend (Saturday and Sunday) or weekday index admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Inpatient mortality, length of inpatient stay, time to chemotherapy, and organ-system failure in index admission. RESULTS: A total of 10 720 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia and 1323 patients with acute myeloid leukemia were identified; 2009 patients (16.7%) were admitted on the weekend. While the total daily number of patients receiving intensive care unit-level care was constant regardless of the day of admission, these patients represented a larger percentage of total admissions on weekends. In adjusted analyses, patients admitted on the weekend did not have an increased rate of mortality during the first admission (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6). Patients whose initial admission for leukemia occurred during a weekend had a significantly increased length of stay (1.4-day increase; 95% CI, 0.7-2.1), time to initiation of chemotherapy (0.36-day increase; 95% CI, 0.3-0.5), and risk for respiratory failure (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7) after adjusting for demographics, severity of illness, and hospital-level factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While pediatric patients with newly diagnosed leukemia admitted on weekends do not have higher mortality rates, they have a prolonged length of stay, increased time to chemotherapy, and higher risk for respiratory failure. Patients who are severely ill at presentation represent a higher proportion of weekend index admissions. Optimizing weekend resources by increasing staffing and access to diagnostic and therapeutic resources may help to reduce hospital length of stay across all weekend admissions and may also ensure the availability of comprehensive care for those weekend admissions with higher acuity.",,"['Goodman, Elizabeth K', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Fitzgerald, Julie', 'Li, Yimei', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Goodman EK', 'Reilly AF', 'Fisher BT', 'Fitzgerald J', 'Li Y', 'Seif AE', 'Huang YS', 'Bagatell R', 'Aplenc R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA Pediatr,JAMA pediatrics,101589544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Philadelphia/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*etiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Time-to-Treatment/statistics & numerical data']",,,2014/08/27 06:00,2015/01/28 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1899235 [pii]', '10.1001/jamapediatrics.2014.1023 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Pediatr. 2014 Oct;168(10):925-31. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2014.1023.,168,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2014.1023 [doi],"[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania5Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania3Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania5Department of Pediatrics, University of P."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania4Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania6The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania5Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania5Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania3Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania5Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania.""]",PMC4404706,,,['JAMA Pediatr. 2014 Oct;168(10):887-8.

The effectiveness of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHCT) in SM remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a global effort to define the value of HCT in SM, 57 patients with the following subtypes of SM were evaluated: SM associated with clonal hematologic non-mast cell disorders (SM-AHNMD; n = 38), mast cell leukemia (MCL; n = 12), and aggressive SM (ASM; n = 7). Median age of patients was 46 years (range, 11 to 67 years). Donors were HLA-identical (n = 34), unrelated (n = 17), umbilical cord blood (n = 2), HLA-haploidentical (n = 1), or unknown (n = 3). Thirty-six patients received myeloablative conditioning (MAC), and 21 patients received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). RESULTS: Responses in SM were observed in 40 patients (70%), with complete remission in 16 patients (28%). Twelve patients (21%) had stable disease, and five patients (9%) had primary refractory disease. Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 57% for all patients, 74% for patients with SM-AHNMD, 43% for those with ASM, and 17% for those with MCL. The strongest risk factor for poor OS was MCL. Survival was also lower in patients receiving RIC compared with MAC and in patients having progression compared with patients having stable disease or response. CONCLUSION: AlloHCT was associated with long-term survival in patients with advanced SM. Although alloHCT may be considered as a viable and potentially curative therapeutic option for advanced SM in the meantime, given that this is a retrospective analysis with no control group, the definitive role of alloHCT will need to be determined by a prospective trial.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Ustun, Celalettin', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Scott, Bart L', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Damaj, Gandhi', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Shanley, Ryan', 'Hogan, William J', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Shore, Tsiporah', 'Baurmann, Herrad', 'Stuart, Robert', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Hsu, Jack W', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Gromke, Tanja', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Gilman, Andrew', 'Wagner, Eva Maria', 'Shwayder, Tor', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza B', 'Bohm, Alexandra', 'Vercellotti, Gregory', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Legrand, Faezeh', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Saber, Wael', 'Barrett, John', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Hagglund, Hans', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Popat, Uday', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Devine, Steven', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Akin, Cem', 'Valent, Peter']","['Ustun C', 'Reiter A', 'Scott BL', 'Nakamura R', 'Damaj G', 'Kreil S', 'Shanley R', 'Hogan WJ', 'Perales MA', 'Shore T', 'Baurmann H', 'Stuart R', 'Gruhn B', 'Doubek M', 'Hsu JW', 'Tholouli E', 'Gromke T', 'Godley LA', 'Pagano L', 'Gilman A', 'Wagner EM', 'Shwayder T', 'Bornhauser M', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Bohm A', 'Vercellotti G', 'Van Lint MT', 'Schmid C', 'Rabitsch W', 'Pullarkat V', 'Legrand F', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Saber W', 'Barrett J', 'Hermine O', 'Hagglund H', 'Sperr WR', 'Popat U', 'Alyea EP', 'Devine S', 'Deeg HJ', 'Weisdorf D', 'Akin C', 'Valent P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/08/27 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2014.55.2018 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2014.55.2018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2014 Oct 10;32(29):3264-74. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.55.2018.

25154820,NLM,MEDLINE,20150414,20211021,1527-7755 (Electronic) 0732-183X (Linking),6,2015 Feb 20,Chemotherapy-refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent B-cell malignancies can be effectively treated with autologous T cells expressing an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor.,540-9,"PURPOSE: T cells can be genetically modified to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). We assessed the safety and efficacy of administering autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells to patients with advanced CD19(+) B-cell malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 15 patients with advanced B-cell malignancies. Nine patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), two had indolent lymphomas, and four had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients received a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, eight achieved complete remissions (CRs), four achieved partial remissions, one had stable lymphoma, and two were not evaluable for response. CRs were obtained by four of seven evaluable patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL; three of these four CRs are ongoing, with durations ranging from 9 to 22 months. Acute toxicities including fever, hypotension, delirium, and other neurologic toxicities occurred in some patients after infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells; these toxicities resolved within 3 weeks after cell infusion. One patient died suddenly as a result of an unknown cause 16 days after cell infusion. CAR T cells were detected in the blood of patients at peak levels, ranging from nine to 777 CAR-positive T cells/muL. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to our knowledge of successful treatment of DLBCL with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of treating chemotherapy-refractory B-cell malignancies with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. The numerous remissions obtained provide strong support for further development of this approach.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Kochenderfer, James N', 'Dudley, Mark E', 'Kassim, Sadik H', 'Somerville, Robert P T', 'Carpenter, Robert O', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Yang, James C', 'Phan, Giao Q', 'Hughes, Marybeth S', 'Sherry, Richard M', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Feldman, Steven', 'Lu, Lily', 'Li, Yong F', 'Ngo, Lien T', 'Goy, Andre', 'Feldman, Tatyana', 'Spaner, David E', 'Wang, Michael L', 'Chen, Clara C', 'Kranick, Sarah M', 'Nath, Avindra', 'Nathan, Debbie-Ann N', 'Morton, Kathleen E', 'Toomey, Mary Ann', 'Rosenberg, Steven A']","['Kochenderfer JN', 'Dudley ME', 'Kassim SH', 'Somerville RP', 'Carpenter RO', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Yang JC', 'Phan GQ', 'Hughes MS', 'Sherry RM', 'Raffeld M', 'Feldman S', 'Lu L', 'Li YF', 'Ngo LT', 'Goy A', 'Feldman T', 'Spaner DE', 'Wang ML', 'Chen CC', 'Kranick SM', 'Nath A', 'Nathan DA', 'Morton KE', 'Toomey MA', 'Rosenberg SA']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2014/08/27 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/08/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2014.56.2025 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2014.56.2025 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2015 Feb 20;33(6):540-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.56.2025.

We used linear trap quadrupole fourier transform (LTQ-FT) tandem mass spectrometry to identify naturally processed and presented peptides eluted from the MHC-negative myeloid leukaemia cell line K562 transfected with specific MHC class I genes. We provide information on the peptidome of HLA-B*39:06, which is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes, and extend the analysis to include a further five human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles (HLA-A*02:01/-A*11:01/-A*24:02/-B*18:01/-B*38:01) studied under identical experimental conditions. We identified a total of 3095 individual peptides with a mascot score >/=40 (HLA-A*02:01 = 569 peptides, -A*11:01 = 904, A*24:02 = 257, -B*18:01 = 615, -B*38:01 = 453, -B*39:06 = 297). Peptides had a preferential length of nine amino acids and originated mainly from cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins. Eluted peptides revealed a strong binding motif with binding anchor positions at position 2 (P2) and the C-terminus (POmega). Peptides eluted from HLA-A*02:01 showed a P2 preference for leucine (62% of total peptides have Leu at P2) and POmega preference for valine (49%). Similar data are provided for HLA-A*11:01 (P2:Thr, 29%; POmega:Lys, 49%), -A*24:02 (P2:Tyr, 78%; POmega:Phe, 41%), -B*18:01 (P2:Glu, 77%; POmega:Tyr, 32%), -B*38:01 (P2:His, 51%; POmega:Leu, 45%) and -B*39:06 (P2:Arg/His, 24%; POmega:Ala, 64%).

However, there is an emerging appreciation that the cytotoxic function of CD4(+) T cells can be effective in a clinical setting. Harnessing this potential will require an understanding of how such cells arise. In this study, we use an IL12-transduced variant of the 70Z/3 leukemia cell line in a B6D2F1 (BDF1) murine model system to reveal a novel cascade of cells and soluble factors that activate anticancer CD4(+) killer cells. We show that natural killer T cells play a pivotal role by activating dendritic cells in a contact-dependent manner; soluble products of this interaction, including MCP-1, propagate the activation signal, culminating in the development of CD4(+) CTLs that directly mediate an antileukemia response while also orchestrating a multipronged attack by other effector cells.

In this study, for the first time, we examined pro-apoptotic activity of SMIP-016 in combination with monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20) in de novo chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells and in different B-cell neoplasm-derived lines. In CLL cells SMIP-016 exerted significant cytotoxicity (versus control - p=0.01). In the in vitro models, SMIP-016 was also distinctly active against Raji line (Burkitt lymphoma; BL) (versus control - p=0.007), Riva-1 line (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; DLBCL) (versus control - p=0.002) and RPMI 8226 line (multiple myeloma cells; MM) (versus control - p=0.03). In studies combining SMIP-016 and ofatumumab, the cytotoxicity against CLL cells was significantly higher than the agents used alone (p<0.03). Remarkably enhanced cytotoxic activity of SMIP-016 and ofatumumab in combination was also observed in Raji and Riva-1 cell lines (p<0.01 and p<0.003, respectively). Importantly, both agents induced cytotoxicity at very low concentrations which suggests that potential side-effects may be decreased in clinical practice. The mechanism responsible for cytotoxicity of SMIP-016 in all the examined models was connected with caspase-dependent apoptosis. In majority of cell types SMIP-016 induced overexpression of Bax protein, as well as downregulation of Bcl-2, cIAP1 (p<0.03) and Smac/DIABLO (p<0.003) apoptosis-regulating proteins. In conclusion, our study demonstrated high pro-apoptotic activity of SMIP-016, especially in combination with ofatumumab, against ex vivo CLL cells, and BL or DLBCL in vitro cell lines. Thus, further preclinical studies in in vivo models are warranted, as this combination may be a promising therapeutic concept for treatment of those malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its potential functional impact and the underlying mechanisms in endometrial cancer progression have not been determined. Here, we report that in aggressive endometrial cancer cells, re-expression of microRNA-101 leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis and senescence. Ectopic overexpression of microRNA-101 attenuates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated cancer cell migration and invasion, abrogates the sphere-forming capacity and enhances chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. Algorithm and microarray-based strategies identifies potential microRNA-101 targets. Among these, we validated EZH2, MCL-1 and FOS as direct targets of miR-101 and silencing of these genes mimics the tumor suppressive effects observed on promoting microRNA-101 function. Importantly, further results suggest an inverse correlation between low miR-101 and high EZH2, MCL-1 and FOS expression in EC specimens. We conclude that, as a crucial tumor suppressor, microRNA-101 suppresses cell proliferation, invasiveness and self-renewal in aggressive endometrial cancer cells via modulating multiple critical oncogenes.

There are conflicting reports on the role of NTAL in the high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (FcepsilonRI) signaling. Studies carried out on mast cells derived from mice with NTAL knock out (KO) and wild type mice suggested that NTAL is a negative regulator of FcepsilonRI signaling, while experiments with RNAi-mediated NTAL knockdown (KD) in human mast cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells suggested its positive regulatory role. To determine whether different methodologies of NTAL ablation (KO vs KD) have different physiological consequences, we compared under well defined conditions FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling events in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) with NTAL KO or KD. BMMCs with both NTAL KO and KD exhibited enhanced degranulation, calcium mobilization, chemotaxis, tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and ERK, and depolymerization of filamentous actin. These data provide clear evidence that NTAL is a negative regulator of FcepsilonRI activation events in murine BMMCs, independently of possible compensatory developmental alterations. To gain further insight into the role of NTAL in mast cells, we examined the transcriptome profiles of resting and antigen-activated NTAL KO, NTAL KD, and corresponding control BMMCs. Through this analysis we identified several genes that were differentially regulated in nonactivated and antigen-activated NTAL-deficient cells, when compared to the corresponding control cells. Some of the genes seem to be involved in regulation of cholesterol-dependent events in antigen-mediated chemotaxis.

Safety or residual allergenicity assessment of these whey hydrolysates is crucial. Currently, rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells expressing the human IgE receptor alpha-chain (huFcepsilonRIalpha-RBL-2H3), sensitized with serum IgE from cow's milk allergic children, are being employed to assess in vitro residual allergenicity of these whey hydrolysates. However, limited availability and inter-lot variation of these allergic sera impede standardization of whey hydrolysate safety testing in degranulation assays. OBJECTIVE: An oligoclonal pool of chimeric human (chu)IgE antibodies against bovine beta-lactoglobulin (a major allergen in whey) was generated to increase sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of existing degranulation assays. METHODS: Mice were immunized with bovine beta-lactoglobulin, and subsequently the variable domains of dissimilar anti-beta-lactoglobulin mouse IgG antibodies were cloned and sequenced. Six chimeric antibodies were generated comprising mouse variable domains and human constant IgE/kappa domains. RESULTS: After sensitization with this pool of anti-beta-lactoglobulin chuIgEs, huFcepsilonRIalpha-expressing RBL-2H3 cells demonstrated degranulation upon cross-linking with whey, native 18 kDa beta-lactoglobulin, and 5-10 kDa whey hydrolysates, whereas a 3 kDa whey hydrolysate and cow's milk powder (mainly casein) showed no degranulation. In parallel, allergic serum IgEs were less sensitive. In addition, our pool anti-beta-lactoglobulin chuIgEs recognized multiple allergenic immunodominant regions on beta-lactoglobulin, which were also recognized by serum IgEs from cow's milk allergic children. CONCLUSION: Usage of our 'unlimited' source and well-defined pool of beta-lactoglobulin-specific recombinant chuIgEs to sensitize huFcepsilonRIalpha on RBL-2H3 cells showed to be a relevant and sensitive alternative for serum IgEs from cow's milk allergic patients to assess safety of whey-based non-allergic hydrolyzed formula.",,"['Knipping, Karen', 'Simons, Peter J', 'Buelens-Sleumer, Laura S', 'Cox, Linda', 'den Hartog, Marcel', 'de Jong, Niels', 'Teshima, Reiko', 'Garssen, Johan', 'Boon, Louis', 'Knippels, Leon M J']","['Knipping K', 'Simons PJ', 'Buelens-Sleumer LS', 'Cox L', 'den Hartog M', 'de Jong N', 'Teshima R', 'Garssen J', 'Boon L', 'Knippels LM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Caseins)', '0 (FCER1A protein, human)', '0 (Lactoglobulins)', '0 (Protein Hydrolysates)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Whey Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Caseins/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Lactoglobulins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Milk Hypersensitivity/immunology', 'Protein Hydrolysates/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Whey/*immunology', 'Whey Proteins/immunology']",,,2014/08/26 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/08/26 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0106025 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-13141 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 25;9(8):e106025. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106025. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0106025 [doi],"['Nutricia Research B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands; Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Bioceros Holding B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Nutricia Research B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Bioceros Holding B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Bioceros Holding B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Bioceros Holding B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Foods, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Nutricia Research B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands; Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Bioceros Holding B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Nutricia Research B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands; Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",PMC4143325,,20140825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SEER research database allowed analysis by the number of cancers per person, which showed that the increase in AML cases and rates for age 60+ years from 2009 to 2010 was due to an increase in cases with a previous cancer(s) largely representing newly-reportable post-MDS, post-MPN and post-CML AML cases.

Among other constituents of cruciferous vegetables, isothiocyanates (ITC) are the main bioactive chemicals present. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is present as gluconasturtiin in many cruciferous vegetables with remarkable anti-cancer effects. PEITC is known to not only prevent the initiation phase of carcinogenesis process but also to inhibit the progression of tumorigenesis. PEITC targets multiple proteins to suppress various cancer-promoting mechanisms such as cell proliferation, progression and metastasis. Pre-clinical evidence suggests that combination of PEITC with conventional anti-cancer agents is also highly effective in improving overall efficacy. Based on accumulating evidence, PEITC appears to be a promising agent for cancer therapy and is already under clinical trials for leukemia and lung cancer. This is the first review which provides a comprehensive analysis of known targets and mechanisms along with a critical evaluation of PEITC as a future anti-cancer agent.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVES: To review the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of myeloid neoplasms, including their significance for diagnostic and prognostic purposes and the possible implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. DATA SOURCES: Literature review. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrent mutations found in myeloid malignancies fall into distinct functional categories. These include (1) cell signaling factors, (2) transcription factors, (3) regulators of the cell cycle, (4) regulators of DNA methylation, (5) regulators of histone modification, (6) RNA-splicing factors, and (7) components of the cohesin complex. As the clinical significance of these mutations and mutation combinations is established, testing for their presence is likely to become a routine part of the diagnostic workup.

METHODS: One hundred and thirteen CP-CML patients taking hydroxyurea, interferon or imatinib were enrolled in this study. All patients were stratified into different groups according to each scoring system and different therapies respectively. And overall survival (OS) rates were observed and compared among different groups. RESULTS: Three scoring systems were effective predictors of OS in CP-CML patients, and EUTOS scoring system may predict more validly. Hasford scoring system was well correlated with Sokal and EUTOS scores (r=0.792, P<0.01 and r=0.624, Plt;0.01). The correlation between Sokal and EUTOS scores was relatively weak (r=0.508, Plt;0.01). Despite imatinib's marked effect in prolonging survival of CML patients, it was incapable of prolonging survival in Sokal, Hasford and EUTOS high- risk patients.

METHODS: The expression of CD147 in SHI-1 cells was knockdowned by the lentiviral vector. The expressions of CD147, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The protein of CD147 was detected by Western blotting. The capabilities of proliferation and infiltration of SHI-1 cell were examined by MTT and trans- matrigel invasion assay co-cultured with leukemia BMSC in vitro. SHI-1 cells were inoculated subcutaneously or via tail vein into nude mice to investigate its growth and infiltrative ability in vivo. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein of CD147 in SHI-1/CD147i cells decreased by 85% and 91%, respectively after the SHI-1 cells were infected by the lentivirus containing the CD147 siRNA. The proliferation capability of SHI-1/CD147i cells significantly decreased than those of SHI-1 and SHI-1/NC cells. The mRNA expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9 in SHI-1/CD147i cells were significantly lower than those in SHI-1/NC and SHI-1 cells. The SHI-1/CD147i cells showed significantly lower invasion rate than SHI-1 cells and SHI-1/NC cells when co-cultured with BMSCs. The neoplasms formed by SHI-1/CD147i cells in the subcutaneous of mice were significantly smaller than of the neoplasms formed by SHI-1 and SHI-1/NC cells. In nude mice inoculated via caudal vein with SHI/CD147i cells, mice demonstrated longer survival and moderate infiltration characteristic than those inoculated with SHI and SHI-1/NC cells.

METHODS: Designed and constructed a RNA interference lentiviral vector I2PP2A-shRNA which targeted against I2PP2A gene, then transfected it into NB4-R1 via polybrene mediation. The I2PP2A expression levels before and after transfection were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Meanwhile, the proliferation and apoptosis rates of each group were determined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay. The protein expressions of caspase-8 and PARP were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Both qRT-PCR and Western blot data showed the I2PP2A expression level was significantly downregulated in the transfection group. The I2PP2A mRNA expression level decreased by (70.0 +/- 9.6)% and (64.0 +/- 6.2)% respectively, compared with blank control and negative control group, and the I2PP2A protein expression level showed a consistent trend. CCK-8 proliferation assay indicated the NB4-R1 cell proliferation rate in I2PP2A-shRNA transfection group significantly reduced compared to blank control group (P<0.05).

RESULTS: There were 58 male patients and 63 female patients (median age 49 years, 10-86 years). Eight of 121 patients (6.6%) with de novo AML were found harboring missense mutation of ND4 gene, including 3 patients with A131V (3/8, 37.5%), 2 patients with A404T (2/8, 25%), 1 patient with F149L (1/8, 12.5%), 1 patient with G242D (1/8, 12.5%) and 1 patient with Y409H (1/8, 12.5%), respectively.

METHODS: Nested reverse transcriptasepolym erase chain reaction was performed on samples from 70 patients to amplify the ABL kinase domain. Then, the amplified product was purified and sequenced in both direction. The homologous analysis was performed in combination of clinical data. RESULTS: The ABL domain point mutations were detected in 32 patients (45.7%) including 16 patients in chronic phase (CP), 6 patients in accelerated phase(AP)and 10 patients in blast phase (BP), which were detected as T315I, E255K, C475Y, Y253H, G321W, G250E, F317L, E258K, F359V, E459K and F311I, respectively.

Recently, whole-genome DNA methylation analyses identified three clinicobiologic CLL subgroups with an epigenetic signature related to different normal B-cell counterparts. Here, we developed a clinically applicable method to identify these subgroups and to study their clinical relevance. Using a support vector machine approach, we built a prediction model using five epigenetic biomarkers that was able to classify CLL patients accurately into the three subgroups, namely naive B-cell-like, intermediate and memory B-cell-like CLL. DNA methylation was quantified by highly reproducible bisulfite pyrosequencing assays in two independent CLL series. In the initial series (n=211), the three subgroups showed differential levels of IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus) mutation (P<0.001) and VH usage (P<0.03), as well as different clinical features and outcome in terms of time to first treatment (TTT) and overall survival (P<0.001). A multivariate Cox model showed that epigenetic classification was the strongest predictor of TTT (P<0.001) along with Binet stage (P<0.001). These findings were corroborated in a validation series (n=97).

Accordingly, a response able to capture the long-term effect of the drug should be selected as the end point of phase II trials aimed at developing new drugs for MPNs. A time-to-event, such as overall survival, or progression-free survival or both, as co-primary end points, should measure efficacy in phase III studies. New drugs should be tested for preventing disease progression in myelofibrosis patients with early disease in randomized studies, and a time to event, such as progression-free or event-free survival should be the primary end point. Phase III trials aimed at preventing vascular events in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia should be based on a selection of the target population based on new prognostic factors, including JAK2 mutation.

The critical ECL3 receptor determinant overlies a splice donor and is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate XPR1 genes; 2 of the 3 rare replacement mutations at this site destroy this receptor determinant. The 13 residue ECL4 is hypervariable, and replacement mutations carrying an intact ECL3 site alter but do not abolish receptor activity, including replacement of the entire loop with that of a jellyfish (Cnidaria) XPR1. Because ECL4 deletions are found in all X-MLV-infected Mus subspecies, we deleted each ECL4 residue to determine if deletion-associated restriction is residue-specific or is effected by loop size. All deletions influence receptor function, although different deletions affect different XP-MLVs.

We investigated the activity and safety of the combination of ibrutinib with the monoclonal antibody rituximab in patients with high-risk CLL. METHODS: In this single-arm phase 2 study, we enrolled adult patients with high-risk CLL at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). All enrolled participants had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (deletion 17p, TP53 mutation, or deletion 11q) or a short progression-free survival (PFS <36 months) after previous first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Patients with symptomatic disease requiring therapy received 28-day cycles of once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg together with rituximab (375 mg/m(2), intravenously, every week during cycle 1, then once per cycle until cycle 6), followed by continuous daily single-agent ibrutinib 420 mg until disease progression or until toxicities or complications precluded further treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01520519, and is no longer accruing patients. FINDINGS: Between Feb 28, 2012, and Sept 11, 2012, we enrolled 40 patients with CLL with high-risk disease features, 20 of whom had deletion 17p (del[17p]) or TP53 mutations (16 previously treated, four untreated), 13 had relapsed CLL with deletion 11q (del[11q]), and seven a PFS less than 36 months after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. 18-month PFS in all patients was 78.0% (95% CI 60.6-88.5), whereas in those with a del(17p) or TP53 mutation it was 72.4% (45.6-87.6) Toxicity was mainly mild to moderate in severity (grade 1-2). Diarrhoea occurred in ten (25%) patients (grade 1 in nine patients and grade 2 in one), bleeding events in 14 (33%) patients (eight grade 1 and five grade 2), nausea or vomiting in 15 patients (38%) (ten grade 1 and five grade 2), and fatigue in seven (18%) patients (four grade 1 and three grade 2). Five patients (13%) had grade 3 infections (two lung infections, one upper respiratory tract infection, one sepsis, and one mucositis), and no grade 4 or 5 infections occurred. One patient had grade 4 neutropenia. INTERPRETATION: The encouraging safety and activity of ibrutinib and rituximab in this population of patients with high-risk CLL merits further investigation of this combination.

Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1 usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53, and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found in the parents.

In this study, we found that LW-218, anew synthesized flavonoid, inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. The IC50s of LW-218 in HL-60, U937, K562, and NB4 cell lines were all less than 5 muM, suggesting greater capacity than compounds we have reported. LW-218 induced differentiation effects including morphologic changes, NBT reduction, and both of CD11b and CD14 expression. Results of western blots and siRNA transfection revealed that LW-218 increased the LAP/LIP ratio of C/EBPbeta which regulated monocytic differentiation of leukemia cells. Meanwhile, these differentiation effects could be attenuated by silencing PLSCR1 via siRNA transfection. In addition, regulation on LAP/LIP ratio, of C/EBPbeta was properly mediated by PLSCR1 which was up-regulated by LW-218. All these results suggested that C/EBPbeta was involved in regulation of PKCdelta/PLSCR1 pathway during flavonoids-induced differentiation.

Altered STAT3 activity is observed in up to 50% of AML correlating with poor prognosis. Activated STAT proteins, classically associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, support tumor development as transcription factors, but alternative STAT functions independent of tyrosine phosphorylation have been documented, including roles for serine-phosphorylated STAT3 in mitochondria supporting transformation by oncogenic Ras. We examined requirements for STAT3 in experimental murine K-Ras-dependent hematopoietic neoplasia. We show that STAT3 is phosphorylated on S727 but not Y705 in diseased animals. Moreover, a mouse with a point mutation abrogating STAT3 S727 phosphorylation displayed delayed onset and decreased disease severity with significantly extended survival. Activated K-Ras required STAT3 for cytokine-independent growth of myeloid progenitors in vitro, and mitochondrially restricted STAT3 and STAT3-Y705F, both transcriptionally inert mutants, supported factor-independent growth. STAT3 was dispensable for growth of normal or K-Ras-mutant myeloid progenitors in response to cytokines. However, abrogation of STAT3-S727 phosphorylation impaired factor-independent malignant growth.

We also evaluated the incidence of pancreatitis, thrombosis, hyperammonemia and central neurotoxicity and their association with asparaginase activity levels. Eighty-nine patients were treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 10 medium-risk intensification protocol, which includes 15 doses of PEGasparaginase (2,500 IU/m(2)) over 30 weeks. Erwinia asparaginase (20,000 IU/m(2)) was administered when allergy to or silent inactivation of PEGasparaginase occurred. Triglyceride, cholesterol and ammonia levels increased rapidly in children treated with PEGasparaginase and remained temporarily elevated, but normalized after administration of the last asparaginase dose. Among the patients treated with PEGasparaginase, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (grade 3/4) were found in 47% and 25%, respectively. The correlation between PEGasparaginase activity levels and triglyceride levels was strongest at week 5 (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.36, P = 0.005). The triglyceride levels were higher in children >/= 10 years old than in younger patients (<10 years old) after adjustment for type of asparaginase preparation: median 4.9 mmol/L versus 1.6 mmol/L (P<0.001). In patients receiving Erwinia asparaginase, triglyceride levels increased in the first weeks as well, but no grade 3/4 dyslipidemia was found. Hyperammonemia (grade 3/4) was only found in patients treated with Erwinia asparaginase (9%). Thrombosis occurred in 4.5%, pancreatitis in 7%, and central neurotoxicity in 9% of patients using either of the two agents; these toxicities were not related to levels of asparaginase activity or to triglyceride levels.

We demonstrate an application of RIIG in morphoproteomics, a theranostic technique aimed at comprehensive analysis of protein circuitries to design effective therapeutic strategies in personalized medicine setting. METHODS: RIIG uses an RDF ""mashup"" knowledge base that integrates publicly available pathway and protein data with ontologies. To mine for RDF-induced Influence Links, RIIG introduces notions of RDF relevancy and RDF collider, which mimic conditional independence and ""explaining away"" mechanism in probabilistic systems. Using these notions and constraint-based structure learning algorithms, the formalism generates the morphoproteomic diagrams, which we call InfluGrams, for further analysis by experts. RESULTS: RIIG was able to recover up to 90% of predefined influence links in a simulated environment using synthetic data and outperformed a naive Monte Carlo sampling of random links. In clinical cases of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma, a significant level of concordance between the RIIG-generated and expert-built morphoproteomic diagrams was observed. In a clinical case of Squamous Cell Carcinoma, RIIG allowed selection of alternative therapeutic targets, the validity of which was supported by a systematic literature review. We have also illustrated an ability of RIIG to discover novel influence links in the general case of the ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Applications of the RIIG formalism demonstrated its potential to uncover patient-specific complex relationships among biological entities to find effective drug targets in a personalized medicine setting. We conclude that RIIG provides an effective means not only to streamline morphoproteomic studies, but also to bridge curated biomedical knowledge and causal reasoning with the clinical data in general.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

We aimed to appraise the clinical research to fulfill the Medical Doctorate (MD) degree in MO at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University (NCI, CU). METHODS: This review included 62 MD theses containing 66 studies. They were reviewed regarding aims, type of study, clinical trial phase, design and methodology, statistical tests, results, limitations, consent and IRB approval. Theses were grouped into 3 periods: 1970-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2008. RESULTS: Almost 76% of the studies were interventional and 24% were observational. Informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval were mentioned in 18 and 2 studies, respectively. While all studies mentioned the aims, none, clearly mentioned the research question. Outcomes were mainly efficacy followed by safety. Study design was inadequately considered, especially in 70's-80's period (p=0.038). Median sample size and study duration were almost stable through the three periods (p=0.441, 0.354, respectively). Most of the studies used both descriptive and analytical statistical methods. In a descending order, researched cancers were lymphoma, breast, leukemia, liver, urinary bladder, lung and colorectal. The commonest stages researched were IV and III. The number of studies focused on assessing biomarkers, biomarkers plus drugs/procedures, drugs and procedures are 20, 20, 16 and 6, respectively.

The role for HDT/ASCT in chemoresistant HL is less well defined. We evaluated long-term outcomes of relapsed/refractory HL patients whose disease was refractory to secondary chemotherapy preceding HDT/ASCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All HL patients who underwent HDT/ASCT in British Columbia for primary progression (PP, defined as progression within 3 months of initial therapy completion) or first relapse (REL1) were reviewed. Patients were grouped based on response to secondary chemotherapy as sensitive (S), resistant (R), and untested/unknown (U). RESULTS: A total of 256 patients underwent HDT/ASCT for PP (35%) or REL1 (65%) between 1985 and 2011. At median follow-up of 11.7 years, 58% were alive without HL, 36% relapsed; 6% died of transplant-related mortality, 3% secondary malignancies, and 3% unrelated causes. For PP/S, PP/R, and PP/U groups, 10-year FFS were 47%, 31%, and 38%; 10-year OS were 52%, 29%, and 37%, respectively. For REL1/S, REL1/R, and REL1/U groups, 10-year FFS were 64%, 51%, and 81%; 10-year OS were 71%, 59%, and 79%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, resistance to secondary chemotherapy predicted for post-transplant mortality in the PP (P = 0.04) but not REL1 (P = 0.16) groups. CONCLUSION: In this large uniformly treated cohort of HL patients with long-term follow-up, chemoresistance preceding HDT/ASCT was identified as a poor prognostic factor; however, this factor can be partially overcome by HDT/ASCT, resulting in cure in 30%-50% of patients. HDT/ASCT should therefore be considered in all transplant eligible patients, regardless of responsiveness to salvage chemotherapy.","['(c) The Author 2014.

The aim of the study was to provide estimates of indicators of long-term survival and cure for 26 cancer types, presently lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 818 902 Italian cancer patients diagnosed at age 15-74 years in 1985-2005 were included. Proportions of patients with the same death rates of the general population (cure fractions) and those of prevalent patients who were not at risk of dying as a result of cancer (cure prevalence) were calculated, using validated mixture cure models, by cancer type, sex, and age group. We also estimated complete prevalence, conditional relative survival (CRS), time to reach 5- and 10-year CRS >95%, and proportion of patients living longer than those thresholds. RESULTS: The cure fractions ranged from >90% for patients aged <45 years with thyroid and testis cancers to <10% for liver and pancreatic cancers of all ages. Five- or 10-year CRS >95% were both reached in <10 years by patients with cancers of the stomach, colon-rectum, pancreas, corpus and cervix uteri, brain, and Hodgkin lymphoma. For breast cancer patients, 5- and 10-year CRSs reached >95% after 19 and 25 years, respectively, and in 15 and 18 years for prostate cancer patients. Five-year CRS remained <95% for >25 years after cancer diagnosis in patients with liver and larynx cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia. Overall, the cure prevalence was 67% for men and 77% for women. Therefore, 21% of male and 31% of female patients had already reached 5-year CRS >95%, whereas 18% and 25% had reached 10-year CRS >95%. CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of Italian cancer patients can be considered cured. This observation has a high potential impact on health planning, clinical practice, and patients' perspective.","['(c) The Author 2014.

In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of wogonin on K562 cells, K562 imatinib-resistant cells, and primary patient-derived CML cells. Wogonin up-regulated transcription factor GATA-1 and enhanced binding between GATA-1 and FOG-1, thereby increasing expression of erythroid-differentiation genes. Wogonin also up-regulated the expression of p21 and induced cell cycle arrest. Studies employing benzidine staining and analyses of cell surface markers glycophorin A (GPA) and CD71 indicated that wogonin promoted differentiation of K562, imatinib-resistant K562, and primary patient-derived CML cells.

Results for vitamin D status and risk of NHL have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to perform a meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence from case-control studies and cohort studies on the association of vitamin D status and the risk of NHL. DESIGN: We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and reference lists for relevant articles. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using fixed-effects, random-effects, or linear regression dose-response models. RESULTS: Nine studies (eight case-control and one cohort studies) were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary OR for highest compared with lowest categories of vitamin D status was 1.03 (95 % CI 0.84, 1.26; heterogeneity I (2) = 57.5 %). The subgroup analysis showed the similar results for dietary vitamin D intake group (1.07; 95 % CI 0.82, 1.40) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration values group (1.03; 95 % CI 0.84, 1.26). The pooling ORs of NHL most common subtypes were 1.05 (0.73, 1.52), 1.00 (0.63, 1.58), 1.10 (0.56, 2.14), and 1.69 (0.68, 4.20) for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and T cell lymphoma. The result from the linear regression dose-response model was similar (p = 0.205).

The in vivo comparison of three SYK containing oncogenes, SYK(wt), TEL-SYK and IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK)-SYK revealed a general myeloexpansion and the establishment of three different hematologic (pre)diseases. SYK(wt) enhanced the myeloid and T-cell compartment, without leukemia/lymphoma development. ITK-SYK caused lethal T-cell lymphomas and the cytoplasmic TEL-SYK fusion induced an acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis-type acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with up to 50% immature megakaryoblasts infiltrating bone marrow, spleen and liver, additional MPN features (myelofibrosis and granulocyte expansion) and MDS stigmata with megakaryocytic and erythroid dysplasia. LKS cells were reduced and all subsets (LT/ST/MPP) showed reduced proliferation rates. SYK inhibitor treatment (R788) of diseased TEL-SYK mice reduced leukocytosis, spleen and liver infiltration, enhanced the hematocrit and prolonged survival time, but could not significantly reduce myelofibrosis.

Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression of ALDH-1, Bmi-1, and Nanog in ESCC tissues from 41 patients who received pre-operative chemoradiation. We evaluated the relationship between expression of these markers, and clinicopathological features, tumor regression grade (TRG), and 5-year overall survival (OS). There were no significant associations of ALDH-1 or Bmi-1 expression with age, gender, clinical stage, and treatments (p>0.05). However, patients with Nanog-positive tumors were significantly older than those whose tumors were Nanog-negative (p = 0.033). TRG after treatment was significantly associated with expression of ALDH-1 (p = 0.001), Bmi-1 (p = 0.004), and Nanog (p<0.001). Although OS was significantly better in patients with low TRGs (p = 0.001), there were no significant correlations between ALDH-1, Bmi-1, or Nanog with OS.

Though most of the host cell genome is available for integration, the process of integration site selection is not random. Retroviruses differ in their choice of chromatin-associated features and also prefer particular nucleotide sequences at the point of insertion. Lentiviruses including HIV-1 preferentially integrate within the bodies of active genes, whereas the prototypical gammaretrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) favors strong enhancers and active gene promoter regions. Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase protein, and recent research has demonstrated that HIV-1 and MoMLV targeting preferences are in large part guided by integrase-interacting host factors (LEDGF/p75 for HIV-1 and BET proteins for MoMLV) that tether viral intasomes to chromatin. In each case, the selectivity of epigenetic marks on histones recognized by the protein tether helps to determine the integration distribution.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), as one of the most important oxidation-regulating enzymes in vivo, suggests the onset and progression of cancer when highly expressed. Furthermore, HO-1 level is related with the occurrence and development of hematological diseases. But the relationship between HO-1 expression and progression/relapse of CML has seldom been studied hitherto. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between them to find out a new molecular marker for prediction. METHODS: A total of 60 peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) samples from 25 CML patients in different phases were collected respectively to detect the expressions of HO-1 and bcr/abl using real-time PCR. Routine blood test was performed to detect the changes of leukocyte and platelet counts. The proportion of primitive cells in BM was detected by flow cytometry. The relationship between high HO-1 expression and CML progression and relapse was explored by the analysis of variance by Wilcoxon test and linear regression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy and cutoff values were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Relative expression of HO-1 mRNA in CML patients peripheral blood was significantly higher than that of donors (P < 0.0001), which were 0.57+/-3.78 and (1.417+/-1.125)x10(-6), respectively. HO-1 expression level in CML patients was 0.061 5+/-0.062 4, which decreased to 0.009 4+/-0.006 7 upon CMoR, and remained remarkably higher 0.016 3+/-0.017 5 than that of normal donors (1.417+/-1.125)x10(-6), P < 0.001. When relapse occurred, HO-1 expression significantly increased from 0.020 6+/-0.021 0 to 3.852+/-10.285 in CMoR stage and undergoing relapse. According to progression of CML, HO-1 expression level in CML patients increased from CP (0.009 5+/-0.017 6) to AP (0.028 0+/-0.055 7) and then to BP (0.276 7 +/- 0.447 0). And there was a linear correlation between HO-1 expression and proportion of primitive CML cells. The diagnostic accuracies and cutoff values of HO-1 expression for CML-CP, CML-AP, and CML-BP were 1.0, 0.748, and 0.965, respectively, as well as 0.000 070, 0.001 917, and 0.020 696, respectively. CONCLUSION: HO-1 may be a potential molecular indicator for the progression and relapse of CML.",,"['Wei, Sixi', 'Wang, Yating', 'Chai, Qixiang', 'Fang, Qin', 'Zhang, Yaming', 'Lu, Yinghao', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Wei S', 'Wang Y', 'Chai Q', 'Fang Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu Y', 'Wang J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2014/08/26 06:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2014/08/23 06:00'],"['2014/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2014;127(15):2795-801.,127,,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, China.

Despite the high rate of cure, children relapse, and recurrent ALL is difficult to cure with chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, improved biological understanding of ALL and the development of rationally designed therapeutics targeting molecules associated with the pathogenesis of ALL are essential. We identified missense and synonymous JAK3 mutations in 16 of 91 pediatric patients with ALL. The expression of JAK3(V722I) mutant caused the cytokine-independent activation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling and conferred the factor-independent growth of murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent pro-B Ba/F3 cells. Importantly, inhibition of JAK3 by the known JAK3 inhibitor CP-690 550 converted the Ba/F3-JAK3(V722I) cells back to factor-dependent growth.

Kinesin spindle protein (KSP), a microtubule-associated motor protein which is essential for cell cycle progression, is overexpressed in bcr-abl+ CML cells. Retrovirus mediated bcr-abl transduction increases KSP expression in cord blood CD34 + cells. SB743921 is a selective KSP inhibitor which is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials for treatment of myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors. Treatment of CML cells with SB743921 resulted in reduced proliferation and colony forming cell (CFC) formation ability. SB743921 also actively blocked cell cycle progression, leading to apoptosis in both primary CML cells and cell lines. KSP inhibition sensitized CML cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis.

Patients taking HC were older (median 19 vs. 17 years of age), had a higher proportion of males (53% vs. 38%), and their median hospitalizations per year was five times greater than in SCD patients not on HC (all P < 0.001). No new AML cases occurred in HC-treated paediatric SCD patients. For adults, the new AML incidence with HC exposure was 10.7/10 000 patient years, vs. 4.0/10 000 patient years in subjects not on HC (P = 0.2), a possible AML risk ratio of 3.18. Adjustment for a probable database bias for AML diagnosis/ascertainment lowered the risk ratio to 0.94 (95% confidence interval = 0.16-5.47). Despite their greater disease severity, the inpatient mortality in SCD adults prescribed HC (0.29%) was lower than that of patients not taking the drug (0.42%, P = 0.032).

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is more prevalent and longer survival compared to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AIMS: To describe episodes of febrile neutropenia (FN) in children with AML, determining frequency of infections as agent, focus and evolution, comparing children with ALL episodes. METHOD: A prospective multicenter study. Children presenting with FN at six hospitals in Santiago, Chile, were invited to participate in two consecutive FONDECYT projects, from April 2004 to June 2011. All patients were uniformly evaluated, recording epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables. Information regarding FN episodes of children with LMA and LLA was used to this study. RESULTS: We evaluated 506 episodes of FN in children with leukemia: 173 children with AML and 333 in children with ALL. NF episodes in children with ALML showed significantly greater depth and duration of neutropenia, febrile remained a > period of time and had a worse clinical outcome, as evidenced by > hemodynamic instability, > sepsis, CRP > 90 mg/L for a longer time, more days of hospitalization, > frequency of hospitalization in ICU, > bacteremia, mainly by Streptococcus viridans group, > change of antimicrobial treatment, > use of antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that FN episodes in children with ALML further evolve unfavorably, compared with episodes of FN in children with ALL.

Anaerobic glycolysis and its implications in cancer have been at the forefront of cancer research for over 90 years. More recently, the role of sphingolipids in cancer cell metabolism has gained recognition, notably ceramide's essential role in programmed cell death and the role of the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) in chemotherapeutic resistance. Despite this knowledge, a direct link between these two fields has yet to be definitively drawn. Herein, we show that in a model of highly glycolytic cells, generation of the glycosphingolipid (GSL) glucosylceramide (GlcCer) by GCS was elevated in response to increased glucose availability, while glucose deprivation diminished GSL levels. This effect was likely substrate dependent, independent of both GCS levels and activity. Conversely, leukemia cells with elevated GSLs showed a significant change in GCS activity, but no change in glucose uptake or GCS expression. In a leukemia cell line with elevated GlcCer, treatment with inhibitors of glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) significantly decreased GlcCer levels. When combined with pre-clinical inhibitor ABT-263, this effect was augmented and production of pro-apoptotic sphingolipid ceramide increased. Taken together, we have shown that there exists a definitive link between glucose metabolism and GSL production, laying the groundwork for connecting two distinct yet essential metabolic fields in cancer research. Furthermore, we have proposed a novel combination therapeutic option targeting two metabolic vulnerabilities for the treatment of leukemia.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Stathem, Morgan', 'Marimuthu, Subathra', ""O'Neal, Julie"", 'Rathmell, Jeffrey C', 'Chesney, Jason A', 'Beverly, Levi J', 'Siskind, Leah J']","['Stathem M', 'Marimuthu S', ""O'Neal J"", 'Rathmell JC', 'Chesney JA', 'Beverly LJ', 'Siskind LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Glycosphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['2-DEOXYGLUCOSE', '2-DG', '6-AMINONICATINOMIDE', '6-AN', 'ABT-263', 'ABT-737', 'APOPTOSIS', 'CERAMIDE', 'GCS', 'GLUCOSE', 'GLUCOSYLCERAMIDE', 'GLUCOSYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE', 'GLYCOLYSIS', 'GLYCOSPHINGOLIPID', 'GSL', 'GlcCer', 'GluCer', 'METABOLISM', 'PENTOSE PHOSPHATE PATHWAY', 'PPP', 'SPHINGOLIPID']",2014/08/26 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2014/08/23 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24943 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2015 Jan;116(1):67-80. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24943.,116,10.1002/jcb.24943 [doi],"['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky.']",PMC4229434,,,,,,,"['R01 HL108006/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR17677 COBRE/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK093462/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017677/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS630321'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction, SAR405838 (MI-77301), that has been advanced into phase I clinical trials. SAR405838 binds to MDM2 with K(i) = 0.88 nmol/L and has high specificity over other proteins. A cocrystal structure of the SAR405838:MDM2 complex shows that, in addition to mimicking three key p53 amino acid residues, the inhibitor captures additional interactions not observed in the p53-MDM2 complex and induces refolding of the short, unstructured MDM2 N-terminal region to achieve its high affinity. SAR405838 effectively activates wild-type p53 in vitro and in xenograft tumor tissue of leukemia and solid tumors, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. At well-tolerated dose schedules, SAR405838 achieves either durable tumor regression or complete tumor growth inhibition in mouse xenograft models of SJSA-1 osteosarcoma, RS4;11 acute leukemia, LNCaP prostate cancer, and HCT-116 colon cancer. Remarkably, a single oral dose of SAR405838 is sufficient to achieve complete tumor regression in the SJSA-1 model. Mechanistically, robust transcriptional upregulation of PUMA induced by SAR405838 results in strong apoptosis in tumor tissue, leading to complete tumor regression. Our findings provide a preclinical basis upon which to evaluate SAR405838 as a therapeutic agent in patients whose tumors retain wild-type p53.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Wang, Shaomeng', 'Sun, Wei', 'Zhao, Yujun', 'McEachern, Donna', 'Meaux, Isabelle', 'Barriere, Cedric', 'Stuckey, Jeanne A', 'Meagher, Jennifer L', 'Bai, Longchuan', 'Liu, Liu', 'Hoffman-Luca, Cassandra Gianna', 'Lu, Jianfeng', 'Shangary, Sanjeev', 'Yu, Shanghai', 'Bernard, Denzil', 'Aguilar, Angelo', 'Dos-Santos, Odette', 'Besret, Laurent', 'Guerif, Stephane', 'Pannier, Pascal', 'Gorge-Bernat, Dimitri', 'Debussche, Laurent']","['Wang S', 'Sun W', 'Zhao Y', 'McEachern D', 'Meaux I', 'Barriere C', 'Stuckey JA', 'Meagher JL', 'Bai L', 'Liu L', 'Hoffman-Luca CG', 'Lu J', 'Shangary S', 'Yu S', 'Bernard D', 'Aguilar A', 'Dos-Santos O', 'Besret L', 'Guerif S', 'Pannier P', 'Gorge-Bernat D', 'Debussche L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8570LZ3RCA (SAR405838)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Drug Stability', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Remission Induction', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/08/26 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/08/23 06:00'],"['2014/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-14-0799 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0799 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Oct 15;74(20):5855-65. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0799.

STWS has a diverse range of clinical features involving hematopoietic, skeletal, neuronal and immune systems. STWS manifests a high mortality due to increased risk of sudden death. Heterodimerization of the LIFR mediates leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signalling through the intracellular Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 signalling cascade. The LIF/LIFR system is highly expressed in and regulates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. OBJECTIVES: HPA function was investigated in three STWS patients to characterise consequences of impaired LIF/LIFR signalling on adrenal function. DESIGN: Six genetically proven STWS patients from four unrelated Turkish families were included in the study. Sudden death occurred in three before 2 years of age. Basal adrenal function tests were performed by measurement of early morning serum cortisol and plasma ACTH concentrations on at least two different occasions. Low dose synacthen stimulation test and glucagon stimulation tests were performed to explore adrenal function in three patients who survived. RESULTS: All patients carried the same LIFR (p.Arg692X) mutation. Our oldest patient had attenuated morning serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels at repeated measurements.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and Web of Knowledge electronic databases was conducted to collect relevant studies until 20 February 2014. References of the retrieved articles were also screened. The extracted data were statistically analyzed, and pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to estimate the association strength using Review Manager version 5.2. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analyses revealed that the GSTM1-null genotype was associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia in East Asians (P = 0.01; odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.42), and GSTT1-null genotype in Caucasians (P < 0.0001; odds ratio = 1.48; 95% confidence interval = 1.29-1.69). There was also a predilection towards the female gender for both of these polymorphisms. For GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism, no significant association was found under any contrast model. In addition, the presence of the double-null genotypes increased the risk of acute myeloid leukemia in both Caucasians and East Asians. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that heritable GST status could influence the risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia.","['(c) The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

Here we found that even in medium supplemented with LIF, mESCs still tend to differentiate toward meso-endoderm lineages after long-term culture and the culture spontaneously secretes vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). Blocking VEGF signaling with sunitinib, an anti-cancer drug and a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor mainly targeting VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), is capable of maintaining the mESCs in the undifferentiated state without the need for feeder cells or LIF. Sunitinib facilitates the derivation of mESCs from blastocysts, and the mESCs maintained in sunitinib-containing medium remain pluripotent and are able to contribute to chimeric mice. Sunitinib also promotes iPSC generation from MEFs with only Oct4. Knocking down VEGFR2 or blocking it with neutralizing antibody mimicks the effect of sunitinib, indicating that blocking VEGF/VEGFR signaling is indeed beneficial to the self-renewal of mESCs. We also found that hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF1alpha) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are involved in the production of VEGF in mESCs. Blocking both pathways inhibits the expression of VEGF and prevents spontaneous differentiation of mESCs. Interestingly, LIF may also exert its effect by downregulating HIF1alpha and ER stress pathways and subsequent VEGF expression. These results indicate the existence of an intrinsic differentiation pathway in mESCs by activating the autocrine VEGF signaling. Blocking VEGF signaling with sunitinib or other small molecules help to maintain the mESCs in the ground state of pluripotency.",,"['Chen, Guofang', 'Xu, Xinxiu', 'Zhang, Lihong', 'Fu, Yanbin', 'Wang, Min', 'Gu, Haifeng', 'Xie, Xin']","['Chen G', 'Xu X', 'Zhang L', 'Fu Y', 'Wang M', 'Gu H', 'Xie X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sunitinib', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2014/08/26 06:00,2015/09/02 06:00,['2014/08/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['cr2014112 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2014.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2014 Sep;24(9):1121-36. doi: 10.1038/cr.2014.112.

Upon dehydration, the SON undergoes a function-related plasticity, which includes remodeling of morphology, electrical properties, and biosynthetic activity. This process occurs alongside alterations in steady state transcript levels, which might be mediated by changes in the activity of transcription factors. In order to identify which transcription factors might be involved in changing patterns of gene expression, an Affymetrix protein-DNA array analysis was carried out. Nuclear extracts of SON from dehydrated and control male rats were analyzed for binding to the 345 consensus DNA transcription factor binding sequences of the array. Statistical analysis revealed significant changes in binding to 26 consensus elements, of which EMSA confirmed increased binding to signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 1/Stat3, cellular Myelocytomatosis virus-like cellular proto-oncogene (c-Myc)-Myc-associated factor X (Max), and pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor 1 sequences after dehydration. Focusing on c-Myc and Max, we used quantitative PCR to confirm previous transcriptomic analysis that had suggested an increase in c-Myc, but not Max, mRNA levels in the SON after dehydration, and we demonstrated c-Myc- and Max-like immunoreactivities in SON arginine vasopressin-expressing cells. Finally, by comparing new data obtained from Roche-NimbleGen chromatin immunoprecipitation arrays with previously published transcriptomic data, we have identified putative c-Myc target genes whose expression changes in the SON after dehydration. These include known c-Myc targets, such as the Slc7a5 gene, which encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 1, ribosomal protein L24, histone deactylase 2, and the Rat sarcoma proto-oncogene (Ras)-related nuclear GTPase.",,"['Qiu, Jing', 'Kleineidam, Anna', 'Gouraud, Sabine', 'Yao, Song Tieng', 'Greenwood, Mingkwan', 'Hoe, See Ziau', 'Hindmarch, Charles', 'Murphy, David']","['Qiu J', 'Kleineidam A', 'Gouraud S', 'Yao ST', 'Greenwood M', 'Hoe SZ', 'Hindmarch C', 'Murphy D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dehydration/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hypothalamus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/*methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",,,2014/08/22 06:00,2015/01/01 06:00,['2014/08/22 06:00'],"['2014/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/en.2014-1448 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2014 Nov;155(11):4380-90. doi: 10.1210/en.2014-1448.

We analyzed the expression of RIP1 and RIP3 in CD34+ leukemia cells from a cohort of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and CD34+ cells from healthy donors. RIP3 expression was significantly reduced in most AML samples, whereas the expression of RIP1 did not differ significantly. When re-expressed in the mouse DA1-3b leukemia cell line, RIP3 induced apoptosis and necroptosis in the presence of caspase inhibitors. Transfection of RIP3 in the WEHI-3b leukemia cell line or in the mouse embryonic fibroblasts also resulted in increased cell death. Surprisingly, re-expression of a RIP3 mutant with an inactive kinase domain (RIP3-kinase dead (RIP3-KD)) induced significantly more and earlier apoptosis than wild-type RIP3 (RIP3-WT), indicating that the RIP3 kinase domain is an essential regulator of apoptosis/necroptosis in leukemia cells. The induced in vivo expression of RIP3-KD but not RIP3-WT prolonged the survival of mice injected with leukemia cells. The expression of RIP3-KD induced p65/RelA nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) subunit caspase-dependent cleavage, and a non-cleavable p65/RelA D361E mutant rescued these cells from apoptosis. p65/RelA cleavage appears to be at least partially mediated by caspase-6.

Few data have been reported regarding the utilization of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (F-FDG PET/CT) in this disease. The aim of this study was to assess the role of F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of NL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients who suffered from NL due to lymphoma or leukemia were studied. The diagnosis of NL lesions was established according to ;the combination of neurologic symptoms, and imaging techniques including MRI and PET/CT, and/or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, pathology, and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Eight patients with lymphoma or leukemia were diagnosed with NL during or after treatment. F-FDG PET/CT was positive in all eight patients. A total of 19 NL lesions were detected by F-FDG PET/CT. Morphological abnormality was seen in seven of 19 lesions on the syn-modality CT. However, all lesions were F-FDG avid with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.42 +/- 3.02, and presented with linear and nodular hypermetabolic patterns. There was a significant difference in the detection of NL lesions between PET and syn-modality CT [100% (19/19) vs. 36.8% (7/19), chi=14.74, P<0.001]. The NL lesions were located predominantly in the nerve root of the thoracic and lumbar segments (63.2%). In four patients, PET/CT was performed after treatment and was useful for assessing the treatment response. CONCLUSION: F-FDG PET/CT is a sensitive imaging modality for the detection of NL lesions.

Clinically, drug combination strategies are widely applied for complex disease management. Here, an optimized, cardiac-friendly therapeutic strategy for APL was investigated using a combination of As2O3 and genistein or resveratrol. Potential combinations were explored with respect to their effects on mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase activity, autophagy, and apoptosis in both NB4 cells and neonatal rat left ventricular myocytes. All experiments consistently suggested that 5 microM resveratrol remarkably alleviates As2O3-induced cardiotoxicity. To achieve an equivalent effect, a 10-fold dosage of genistein was required, thus highlighting the dose advantage of resveratrol, as poor bioavailability is a common concern for its clinical application. Co-administration of resveratrol substantially amplified the anticancer effect of As2O3 in NB4 cells. Furthermore, resveratrol exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis, thereby reflecting its full range of synergism with As2O3. Addition of 5 microM resveratrol to the single drug formula of As2O3 also further increased the expression of LC3, a marker of cellular autophagy activity, indicating an involvement of autophagy-mediated tumor cell death in the synergistic action.

Herein, the molecular mechanisms by which PTER exerts its anticancer effects against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were investigated. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Results showed that PTER suppressed cell proliferation in various AML cell lines. PTER-induced G0/G1-phase arrest occurred when expressions of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2/6 were inhibited. PTER-induced cell apoptosis occurred through activation of caspases-8-9/-3, and a mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP)-dependent pathway. Moreover, treatment of HL-60 cells with PTER induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, and inhibition of both MAPKs by their specific inhibitors significantly abolished the PTER-induced activation of caspases-8/-9/-3. Of note, PTER-induced cell growth inhibition was only partially reversed by the caspase-3-specific inhibitor, Z-DEVE-FMK, suggesting that this compound may also act through a caspase-independent pathway. Interestingly, we also found that PTER promoted disruption of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and release of activated cathepsin B. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that PTER induced HL-60 cell death via MAPKs-mediated mitochondria apoptosis pathway and loss of LMP might be another cause for cell apoptosis induced by PTER.",,"['Hsiao, Pei-Ching', 'Chou, Ying-Erh', 'Tan, Peng', 'Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Chen, Hui-Yu', 'Lin, Chien-Huang', 'Lee, Liang-Ming', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien']","['Hsiao PC', 'Chou YE', 'Tan P', 'Lee WJ', 'Yang SF', 'Chow JM', 'Chen HY', 'Lin CH', 'Lee LM', 'Chien MH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '26R60S6A5I (pterostilbene)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",,,2014/08/22 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/08/22 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0105342 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-12743 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 21;9(8):e105342. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0105342. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0105342 [doi],"['School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",PMC4140770,,20140821,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of MPL gene mutations is a critical diagnostic criterion for these diseases. Here, we developed a rapid, simple, and cost-effective method of detecting two major MPL mutations, MPLW515L/K, in a single PCR assay; we termed this method DARMS (dual amplification refractory mutation system)-PCR. DARMS-PCR is designed to produce three different PCR products corresponding to MPLW515L, MPLW515K, and all MPL alleles. The amplicons are later detected and quantified using a capillary sequencer to determine the relative frequencies of the mutant and wild-type alleles.

Although previously reported host expression datasets had identified putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets of typhoid fever, the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. METHODS: We used five gene expression datasets of human peripheral blood from patients suffering from S. Typhi or other bacteremic infections or non-infectious disease like leukemia. The expression datasets were merged into human protein interaction network (PIN) and the expression correlation between the hubs and their interacting proteins was measured by calculating Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) values. The differences in the average PCC for each hub between the disease states and their respective controls were calculated for studied datasets. The individual hubs and their interactors with expression, PCC and average PCC values were treated as dynamic subnetworks. The hubs that showed unique trends of alterations specific to S. Typhi infection were identified. RESULTS: We identified S. Typhi infection-specific dynamic subnetworks of the host, which involve 81 hubs and 1343 interactions. The major enriched GO biological process terms in the identified subnetworks were regulation of apoptosis and biological adhesions, while the enriched pathways include cytokine signalling in the immune system and downstream TCR signalling. The dynamic nature of the hubs CCR1, IRS2 and PRKCA with their interactors was studied in detail. The difference in the dynamics of the subnetworks specific to S. Typhi infection suggests a potential molecular model of typhoid fever. CONCLUSIONS: Hubs and their interactors of the S. Typhi infection-specific dynamic subnetworks carrying distinct PCC values compared with the non-typhoid and other disease conditions reveal new insight into the pathogenesis of S. Typhi.",,"['Dhal, Paltu Kumar', 'Barman, Ranjan Kumar', 'Saha, Sudipto', 'Das, Santasabuj']","['Dhal PK', 'Barman RK', 'Saha S', 'Das S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR1/metabolism', 'Salmonella Infections/*metabolism', 'Salmonella typhi/*physiology']",,,2014/08/22 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/08/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0104911 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-19681 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 21;9(8):e104911. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0104911. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0104911 [doi],"['Biomedical Informatics Centre, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Biomedical Informatics Centre, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Bioinformatics Centre, Bose Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Biomedical Informatics Centre, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Division of Clinical Medicine, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",PMC4140748,,20140821,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline infectious agents offer powerful natural models of deadly human diseases, which include feline immunodeficiency virus, feline sarcoma virus and feline leukemia virus. A rich veterinary literature of feline disease pathogenesis and the demonstration of a highly conserved ancestral mammal genome organization make the cat genome annotation a highly informative resource that facilitates multifaceted research endeavors. FINDINGS: Here we report a preliminary annotation of the whole genome sequence of Cinnamon, a domestic cat living in Columbia (MO, USA), bisulfite sequencing of Boris, a male cat from St. Petersburg (Russia), and light 30x sequencing of Sylvester, a European wildcat progenitor of cat domestication. The annotation includes 21,865 protein-coding genes identified by a comparative approach, 217 loci of endogenous retrovirus-like elements, repetitive elements which comprise about 55.7% of the whole genome, 99,494 new SNVs, 8,355 new indels, 743,326 evolutionary constrained elements, and 3,182 microRNA homologues. The methylation sites study shows that 10.5% of cat genome cytosines are methylated. An assisted assembly of a European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris, was performed; variants between F. silvestris and F. catus genomes were derived and compared to F. catus. CONCLUSIONS: The presented genome annotation extends beyond earlier ones by closing gaps of sequence that were unavoidable with previous low-coverage shotgun genome sequencing.

This receptor associates with intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, essentially janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which regulates MPL stability and cell-surface expression, and mediates TPO-induced signal transduction. We demonstrate that JAK2 and MPL mediate TPO-induced proliferation arrest and megakaryocytic differentiation of the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line UT7-MPL. A decrease in JAK2 or MPL protein expression, and JAK2 chemical inhibition, suppress this antiproliferative action of TPO. The expression of JAK2 and MPL, which progressively increases along normal human megakaryopoiesis, is decreased in platelets of patients diagnosed with JAK2- or MPL-mutated essential thrombocytemia and primary myelofibrosis, 2 myeloproliferative neoplasms in which megakaryocytes (MKs) proliferate excessively.

We evaluated the role of the IL-7Ralpha Tyr(449) cytoplasmic SH2-binding motif in IL-7-mediated B cell development using a knock-in mouse with a Tyr to Phe mutation (IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) mouse). IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) and IL-7Ralpha(-/-) mice showed no defect in the number of pre-pro-B cells, although IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) mice had decreased Ebf1 in pre-pro-B cells and impairment in B cell-committed CLPs. We identified that IL-7Ralpha Tyr(449) was critical for both pro-B and pre-B stages of development in the bone marrow. IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) and IL-7Ralpha(-/-) mice had comparable precursor B cell defects, indicating that signaling from the IL-7Ralpha required this motif. Although the defect in IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) pro-B cells was associated with loss of STAT5 activation and diminished expression of Mcl1, this was not rescued by overexpression of Bcl-2. IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) and IL-7Ralpha(-/-) pre-B cells also showed defective cyto-Igmu and CD25 expression, associated with reduced levels of Rag1, Rag2, and Irf4. Pre-B cells from IL-7Ralpha(449F/449F) mice also failed to proliferate, perhaps as a result of the failure to rearrange Igmu. Our data suggest that IL-7Ralpha Tyr(449) was essential for IL-7Ralpha signaling in bone marrow B cell development and survival.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Patton, Daniel T', 'Plumb, Adam W', 'Abraham, Ninan']","['Patton DT', 'Plumb AW', 'Abraham N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Il2ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '0 (interleukin-7 receptor, alpha chain)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics/*immunology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tyrosine/genetics/immunology']",,,2014/08/22 06:00,2014/11/15 06:00,['2014/08/22 06:00'],"['2014/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302925 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302925 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Oct 1;193(7):3446-55. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302925.

One of the reasons for the inconsistencies in results could be the fact that the phenotype investigated has mostly the diagnosis of schizophrenia per se, which is widely heterogeneous, both clinically and biologically. In the present study we tested, in a large cohort of 461 schizophrenia patients recruited in Scotland, whether several SNPs in NRG1 and/or ErbB4 are associated with schizophrenia symptom dimensions as evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We then followed up nominally significant results in a second cohort of 439 schizophrenia subjects recruited in Germany. Using linear regression, we observed two different groups of polymorphisms in NRG1 gene: one showing a nominal association with higher scores of the PANSS positive dimension and the other one with higher scores of the PANSS negative dimension. Regarding ErbB4, a small cluster located in the 5' end of the gene was detected, showing nominal association mainly with negative, general and total dimensions of the PANSS.

The chemical structure of HJC was validated by LC-ESI-MS/MS, cytotoxicity was assayed using MTT, and apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry. These assays indicated that HJC remarkably inhibited the growth in K562 cells by decreasing cell proliferation, reducing the SOD activity, enhancing ROS levels and inducing apoptosis. Activation of caspase-3 indicated that HJC may be inducing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways and that HJC-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent.

HQ17(3) has cytotoxic effect on cancer cells and can inhibit topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha activity. We treated various cancer cells with different doses of HQ17(3) and found that leukemia cells were most sensitive to HQ17(3). After analysis of microRNA (miRNA) profiling, we found that treatment with HQ17(3) caused downregulation of miR-17-92 cluster in some leukemia cells. These changes partially restored the normal levels from leukemia-specific miRNA expression signature. Messenger RNAs of tumor suppressor proteins, such as pRB, PTEN, and Dicer, are targets of miR-17-92 cluster. Their protein levels were increased after the treatment. c-Myc is a regulatory protein for miR-17-92 gene. Similar to topo IIalpha, we found that c-Myc decreased its activity after the HQ17(3) treatment, which may explain the downregulation of miR-17-92 cluster. Combined with 5-fluorouracil, NaAsO2, or ABT-737, HQ17(3) elicited additive inhibitory effects on leukemia cells. In conclusion, the high sensitivity of leukemia cells to HQ17(3) may be associated with the reduction of topo IIalpha and c-Myc activities, as well as with the downregulation of the miR-17-92 cluster expression.",,"['Liao, Ya-Chun', 'Lin, Tzu-Heng', 'Chen, Chih-Ying', 'Lin, Shwu-Bin', 'Au, Lo-Chun']","['Liao YC', 'Lin TH', 'Chen CY', 'Lin SB', 'Au LC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (2-(10-heptadecenyl)-1,4-hydroquinone)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding']",,,2014/08/21 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/08/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/306718 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:306718. doi: 10.1155/2014/306718.

Elevated expression of serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) may participate in the pathway responsible for the dysregulation of splicing events in malignant tumor cells. In this study, we observed a correlation between the cytoplasmic accumulation of RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) and up-regulated SRPK1 in breast cancer cells. The production of the IR-B and MCL-1S transcripts was induced separately by the overexpression of RBM4 and SRPK1 gene silencing. Overexpressed RBM4 simultaneously bound to the CU-rich elements within the MCL-1 exon2 and the downstream intron, which subsequently facilitated the exclusion of the regulated exon. Breast cancer cells are deprived of apoptotic resistance through the RBM4-mediated up-regulation of the IR-B and MCL-1S transcripts. These findings suggest that the splicing events regulated by the SRPK1-RMB4 network may contribute to tumorigenesis through altered sensitivity to apoptotic signals in breast cancer cells.","['(c) 2014 Lin et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA', 'Society.']","['Lin, Jung-Chun', 'Lin, Ching-Yu', 'Tarn, Woan-Yuh', 'Li, Fang-Yu']","['Lin JC', 'Lin CY', 'Tarn WY', 'Li FY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RBM4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (SRPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",['NOTNLM'],"['MCL-1', 'RNA binding motif protein 4', 'alternative splicing', 'breast cancer']",2014/08/21 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/08/21 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.045583.114 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.045583.114 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2014 Oct;20(10):1621-31. doi: 10.1261/rna.045583.114.

Survival data from population registries, estimated resource use from clinical practice and quality of life estimates were employed. Substantial health gains were noted over time, paralleled by increased treatment costs. Median survival was 1.9, 4.0 and 13 years during the respective time periods. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between periods III and II was euro52,700 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

In this study, we describe that the murine DCs upon stimulation with recombinant IL-15 in vitro or in vivo, expresses TNF superfamily member TRAIL which mediates cytotoxicity and growth inhibition against a murine lymphoma called Dalton lymphoma (DL) via apoptosis. Presence of tumor lysate or intact tumor cells significantly reduces the DC mediated tumoricidal effect, possibly via masking and down-regulating TRAIL in DCs. The antitumor effect of DC derived TRAIL was further augmented by deactivation of STAT3 in tumor cells by cucurbitacin I, which makes it more susceptible to DC derived TRAIL Treatment of tumor cells with cucurbitacin I upregulates TRAIL receptor expression in addition to activation of caspases. Compared to naive DCs, DCs from tumor bearing mice are significantly impaired in TRAIL expression and consequent antitumor functions against DL which was partially restored by activation with IL-15 or LPS. Priming with recombinant IL-15 prolongs the survival of tumor bearing mice treated with cucurbitacin I.

The mechanism of regulation of PRL-3 remains obscure. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a latent transcriptional factor, has also been often found to be activated in AML. We first identified STAT3-consensus-binding sites in the promoter of PRL-3 genes. Then we experimentally validated the direct binding and transcriptional activation. We applied shRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression approaches in STAT3(-/-) liver cells and leukemic cells to validate the functional regulation of PRL-3 by STAT3. A STAT3 core signature, derived through data mining from publicly available gene expression data, was employed to correlate PRL-3 expression in large AML patient samples. We discovered that STAT3 binds to the -201 to -210 region of PRL-3, which was conserved between human and mouse. Importantly, PRL-3 protein was significantly reduced in mouse STAT3-knockout liver cells compared with STAT3-wild type counterparts, and ectopic expression of STAT3 in these cells led to a pronounced increase in PRL-3 protein. We demonstrated that STAT3 functionally regulated PRL-3, and STAT3 core signature was enriched in AML with high PRL-3 expression. Targeting either STAT3 or PRL-3 reduced leukemic cell viability. Silencing PRL-3 impaired invasiveness and induced leukemic cell differentiation. In conclusion, PRL-3 was transcriptionally regulated by STAT3. The STAT3/PRL-3 regulatory loop contributes to the pathogenesis of AML, and it might represent an attractive therapeutic target for antileukemic therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Meayamycin B switches the splicing pattern of myeloid cell leukemia factor 1 (MCL1) pre-mRNA. Specifically, inhibition of splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) with meayamycin B promotes the generation of the proapoptotic, short splicing variant (MCL1-S) and diminishes the antiapoptotic, long variant (MCL1-L). This action was previously associated with the cytotoxicity of meayamycin B in non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines. ABT-737 induced apoptosis in response to an ablation of MCL1-L by meayamycin B. In this study, we further exploited this synergistic combination in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), up to 90% of which overexpress MCL1 and BCL-X(L). In a panel of seven HNSCC cell lines, the combination of meayamycin B and ABT-737 rapidly triggered a Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis that overcame the resistance from HPV16-positive HNSCC against each agent alone. Both RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that meayamycin B up-regulated MCL1-S and down-regulated MCL1-L.

The functional role of H3K4 methylation, however, remains largely unclear in the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here we show that DPY30, a shared core subunit of the SET1/MLL family methyltransferase complexes and a facilitator of their H3K4 methylation activity, is important for ex vivo proliferation and differentiation of human CD34(+) HPCs. DPY30 promotes HPC proliferation by directly regulating the expression of genes critical for cell proliferation. Interestingly, while DPY30 knockdown in HPCs impaired their differentiation into the myelomonocytic lineage, it potently promoted hemoglobin production and affected the kinetics of their differentiation into the erythroid lineage. In an in vivo model, we show that morpholino-mediated dpy30 knockdown resulted in severe defects in the development of the zebrafish hematopoietic system, which could be partially rescued by coinjection of dpy30 messenger RNA.

We hypothesized that osteoblasts, components of the niche involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, influence the fate of leukemic blasts. We show that osteoblast numbers decrease by 55% in myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Further, genetic depletion of osteoblasts in mouse models of acute leukemia increased circulating blasts and tumor engraftment in the marrow and spleen leading to higher tumor burden and shorter survival. Myelopoiesis increased and was coupled with a reduction in B lymphopoiesis and compromised erythropoiesis, suggesting that hematopoietic lineage/progression was altered. Treatment of mice with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia with a pharmacologic inhibitor of the synthesis of duodenal serotonin, a hormone suppressing osteoblast numbers, inhibited loss of osteoblasts. Maintenance of the osteoblast pool restored normal marrow function, reduced tumor burden, and prolonged survival. Leukemia prevention was attributable to maintenance of osteoblast numbers because inhibition of serotonin receptors alone in leukemic blasts did not affect leukemia progression. These results suggest that osteoblasts play a fundamental role in propagating leukemia in the marrow and may be a therapeutic target to induce hostility of the niche to leukemia blasts.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Krevvata, Maria', 'Silva, Barbara C', 'Manavalan, John S', 'Galan-Diez, Marta', 'Kode, Aruna', 'Matthews, Brya Grace', 'Park, David', 'Zhang, Chiyuan A', 'Galili, Naomi', 'Nickolas, Thomas L', 'Dempster, David W', 'Dougall, William', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Economides, Aris N', 'Kalajzic, Ivo', 'Raza, Azra', 'Berman, Ellin', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Kousteni, Stavroula']","['Krevvata M', 'Silva BC', 'Manavalan JS', 'Galan-Diez M', 'Kode A', 'Matthews BG', 'Park D', 'Zhang CA', 'Galili N', 'Nickolas TL', 'Dempster DW', 'Dougall W', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Economides AN', 'Kalajzic I', 'Raza A', 'Berman E', 'Mukherjee S', 'Bhagat G', 'Kousteni S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (LP533401)', '0 (Pyrimidines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Disease Progression', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2014/08/21 06:00,2015/02/28 06:00,['2014/08/21 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39687-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-517219 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Oct 30;124(18):2834-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-517219.

In children, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended, but very limited data on outcome are reported. We determined the outcome of 29 children with FLT3/ITD-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who underwent allogeneic HSCT in 4 pediatric centers. Eleven patients (38%) received matched related donor hematopoietic stem cells and 18 (62%) received alternative donors. Eighteen patients (62%) received total body irradiation (TBI)-based regimens. No patients experienced transplantation-related mortality. Eleven patients (38%) experienced relapsed disease. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.4% to 54.9%). Two-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 65.3% (95% CI, 45.1% to 79.6%) and 82.2% (95% CI, 58.5% to 91.3%), respectively. There was no difference in the DFS of patients who received transplants from related donors versus the DFS of those who received transplants from alternative donors (hazard ratio [HR], 2.64; 95% CI, .79 to 8.76; P = .10), using univariate analysis. Patients with higher FLT3/ITD ratio at diagnosis had significantly worse DFS (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.93; P = .03). The use of TBI in the preparative regimen was associated with superior DFS (HR, .29; 95% CI, .08 to .99; P = .04) and OS (HR, .07; 95% CI, .01 to .62; P = .002). We conclude that allogeneic HSCT improves DFS and OS in children with FLT3/ITD-positive AML compared with what has been reported in those treated with chemotherapy alone.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We have described a novel prophylaxis regimen in a single institution trial. The Chinese Bone Marrow Transplant Cooperative Group (CBMTCG) initiated a phase II multicenter study. METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective, single arm phase II open-label, multicenter clinical trial. The primary endpoint was improvement of aGVHD by 25% over historical control (40%) in Chinese patients. 508 patients were enrolled. All of the patients received cyclosporine A (CsA), methotrexate (MTX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (0.5-1.0 g daily for 30 days) as GVHD prophylaxis regimen. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was met with cumulative incidences of grades 2 to 4 and grades 3 to 4 aGVHD of 23.2% and 10.3%, respectively. Incidence for cGVHD was 67.4%. The non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate was 18.4% at 2 years. The probabilities of leukemia free survival (LFS) for non-advanced stage and advanced stage patients at 2 years were 69.7% and 44.8% respectively (p = 0.000). Recipient age >/= 40 years, advanced stage and Busulfan-Fludarabine(BuFlu) conditioning regimen were identified as major risk factors for aGVHD. Recipient age >/= 40 years, BuFlu conditioning regimens, female donor/male recipient and prior aGVHD were associated with cGVHD. Despite lower RM (relapse mortality), patients with grade 2-4 aGVHD had higher NRM and worse OS and LFS compared to patients with grade 0-1 aGVHD. In contrast, patients with cGVHD had better OS and LFS and lower RM compared to patients without cGVHD. CONCLUSION: The novel GVHD regimen decreased the risk for aGVHD by 42% without improving the risk for cGVHD compared to historical controls. Development of aGVHD was associated with worse OS and LFS as well as higher NRM. In contrast, cGVHD was associated with improved OS and LFS likely attributed to a GVL effect.",,"['Lai, Yong-Rong', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Hu, Deng-Ming', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Liu, Lin', 'Hou, Jian', 'Schwarzenberger, Paul', 'Li, Qiao-Chuan', 'Zhang, Zhong-Ming', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Lai YR', 'Chen YH', 'Hu DM', 'Jiang M', 'Liu QF', 'Liu L', 'Hou J', 'Schwarzenberger P', 'Li QC', 'Zhang ZM', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/08/21 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/08/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0059-3 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0059-3 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Aug 21;7:59. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0059-3.,7,10.1186/s13045-014-0059-3 [doi],"[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China. xjhrm@medmail.com.cn.""]",PMC4237802,,20140821,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophages play a role in regulating cellular turnover in the mammary gland and may affect cancer susceptibility. However, the immune microenvironment that regulates macrophage function has not been described. Hormonal regulation of the cytokine microenvironment across the ovarian cycle was explored using microbead multiplex assay for 15 cytokines in mammary glands from C57Bl/6 mice at different stages of the oestrous cycle, and in ovariectomised mice administered oestradiol and progesterone. The cytokines that were found to fluctuate over the course of the oestrous cycle were colony-stimulating factor (CSF)1, CSF2, interferon gamma (IFNG) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFA), all of which were significantly elevated at oestrus compared with other phases. The concentration of serum progesterone during the oestrus phase negatively correlated with the abundance of cytokines CSF3, IL12p40, IFNG and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In ovariectomised mice, exogenous oestradiol administration increased mammary gland CSF1, CSF2, IFNG and LIF, compared with ovariectomised control mice. Progesterone administration together with oestradiol resulted in reduced CSF1, CSF3 and IFNG compared with oestradiol administration alone. This study suggests that the cytokine microenvironment in the mammary gland at the oestrus phase of the ovarian cycle is relatively pro-inflammatory compared with other stages of the cycle, and that the oestradiol-induced cytokine microenvironment is significantly attenuated by progesterone.

In order to determine the real-life consequences of BTK platelet blockade, we performed light transmission aggregometry in 23 patients receiving ibrutinib treatment. All patients had reductions in collagen-mediated platelet aggregation, with a significant association between the degree of inhibition and the occurrence of clinical bleeding or bruising (P=0.044). This collagen defect was reversible on drug cessation. In contrast to the previous ex vivo report, we found no in vivo ADP defects in subjects receiving standard doses of ibrutinib.

Numerous studies had revealed that occupational PCP exposure probably increased risk of cancers, but whether long-term community-level exposure to PCP generates the similarly carcinogenic effect, seldom studies focused on it. This study was to explore the cancer risks of long-term community-level PCP exposure from drinking water in a Chinese general population. Incident (2009-2012) cancer records were identified by local government national registry. And PCP concentration of raw drinking water samples in each district was measured by GC-MS/MS analysis for further division of three PCP exposure categories by interquartile range (high vs. medium vs. low). Internal comparisons were performed, and standard rate ratio was calculated to describe the relationship between PCP exposure and cancer risks by using low-exposure group as the reference group. PCP was detected in all 27 raw drinking water samples ranging from 11.21 to 684.00 ng/L. A total of 6,750 cases (4,409 male and 2,341 female cases) were identified, and age-standardized rate (world) was 154.95 per 100,000 person-years. The cancer incidence for the high-exposure group was remarkably high. Internal comparisons indicated that high PCP exposure might be positively associated with high cancer risks in the community population, particularly for leukemia (SRR = 5.93, 95 % CI = 5.24-6.71), maligant lymphoma (SRR = 2.27, 95 % CI = 2.10-2.54), and esophageal cancer (SRR = 2.42, 95 % CI = 2.35-2.50).

Here, novel molecular mechanisms through which quercetin exerts its anticancer effects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were investigated. Results from Western blot and flow cytometric assays revealed that quercetin significantly induced caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in HL-60 AML cells. The induction of PARP cleavage by quercetin was also observed in other AML cell lines: THP-1, MV4-11, and U937. Moreover, treatment of HL-60 cells with quercetin induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and inhibition of ERK by an ERK inhibitor significantly abolished quercetin-induced cell apoptosis. MitoSOX red and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin fluorescence, respectively, showed that mitochondrial superoxide and intracellular peroxide levels were higher in quercetin-treated HL-60 cells compared with the control group. Moreover, both N-acetylcysteine and the superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP, reversed quercetin-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species production, ERK activation, and subsequent cell death. The in vivo xenograft mice experiments revealed that quercetin significantly reduced tumor growth through inducing intratumoral oxidative stress while activating the ERK pathway and subsequent cell apoptosis in mice with HL-60 tumor xenografts. In conclusions, our results indicated that quercetin induced cell death of HL-60 cells in vitro and in vivo through induction of intracellular oxidative stress following activation of an ERK-mediated apoptosis pathway.",,"['Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Hsiao, Michael', 'Chang, Junn-Liang', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Tseng, Tsui-Hwa', 'Cheng, Chao-Wen', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Lin, Ke-Hsun', 'Lin, Yung-Wei', 'Liu, Chung-Chi', 'Lee, Liang-Ming', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien']","['Lee WJ', 'Hsiao M', 'Chang JL', 'Yang SF', 'Tseng TH', 'Cheng CW', 'Chow JM', 'Lin KH', 'Lin YW', 'Liu CC', 'Lee LM', 'Chien MH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/08/21 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2014/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-014-1300-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2015 Jul;89(7):1103-17. doi: 10.1007/s00204-014-1300-0.

The present study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) in adult Ph-negative ALL CR1 patients (n = 183). We produced an unmanipulated haplo-HSCT protocol including granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for all donors, intensive immune suppression, anti-thymocyte globulin, and combination of G-CSF-primed bone marrow harvest and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells harvest as the source of stem cell grafts. The median age for high-risk versus low-risk groups were 29 versus 23 years. Three-year incidences of relapse mortality and nonrelapse mortality for high-risk versus low-risk groups were 7.1% versus 11.1% (p = 0.498) and 18.0% versus 16.2% (p = 0.717), respectively.

Multivariate analysis showed that limited cGVHD and a lower pre-HSCT comorbidity burden were associated with better outcomes.

Hence, it is necessary and urgent to develop more selective and effective molecular targeted agents against lung cancer. Here, we have synthesized novel theanine derivatives, methyl coumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine (TMC), ethyl coumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine (TEC), ethyl 6-fluorocoumarin- 3-carboxylyl L-theanine (TFC), and ethyl 6-nitrocoumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine (TNC), which are fluorescent small molecules, based on their parental compound theanine and studied their anticancer activities in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of human and mouse cancers. Our results show that the four theanine derivatives significantly inhibit the lung cancer cell migration and the growth of lung cancer and leukemia cell lines. TFC and TNC display enhanced effects with anticancer drugs cytarabine vincristine, andmethotrexate on inhibition of lung cancer cell growth and no toxicity to the normal human embryonic lung fibroblast and peripheral blood lymphocytes. TFC and TNC exhibit strong suppression of the highly metastatic Lewis lung cancer (LLC) and A549 tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice without toxicity to mice. TFC and TNC can effectively suppress the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo by targeting EGFR/VEGFR-Akt/NF-kappaB pathways.

This technique utilizes limited amounts of DNA as starting material and relies on PCR based quantification of unique DNA sequences that are created by circular ligation of restricted genomic DNA from translocation bearing cells. Because the complete potential breakpoint region is interrogated, a prior knowledge of the individual, specific interchromosomal fusion site is not required. We validated GIPFEL for the five most common gene fusions associated with childhood leukemia (MLL-AF4, MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1). A workflow of restriction digest, purification, ligation, removal of linear fragments and precipitation enriching for circular DNA was developed. GIPFEL allowed detection of translocation specific signature sequences down to a 10-4 dilution which is close to the theoretical limit. In a blinded proof-of-principle study utilizing DNA from cell lines and 144 children with B-precursor-ALL associated translocations this method was 100% specific with no false positive results. Sensitivity was 83%, 65%, and 24% for t(4;11), t(9;11) and t(11;19) respectively. Translocation t(12;21) was correctly detected in 64% and t(1;19) in 39% of the cases.

An example of this is the altered nuclear positioning of the HLXB9 gene in leukaemia cells observed in association with its over-expression. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of a chromosomal translocation with breakpoint proximal to the HLXB9 gene. Before becoming an interesting gene in cancer biology, HLXB9 was studied as a developmental gene. This homeobox gene is also known as MNX1 (motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1) and it is relevant for both motor neuronal and pancreatic beta cells development. A spectrum of mutations in this gene are causative of sacral agenesis and more broadly, of what is known as the Currarino Syndrome, a constitutional autosomal dominant disorder. Experimental work on animal models has shown that HLXB9 has an essential role in motor neuronal differentiation. Here we present data to show that, upon treatment with retinoic acid, the HLXB9 gene becomes over-expressed during the early stages of neuronal differentiation and that this corresponds to a reposition of the gene in the nucleus. More precisely, we used the SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cell line as an in vitro model and we demonstrated a transient transcription of HLXB9 at the 4th and 5th days of differentiation that corresponded to the presence, predominantly in the cell nuclei, of the encoded protein HB9. The nuclear positioning of the HLXB9 gene was monitored at different stages: a peripheral location was noted in the proliferating cells whereas a more internal position was noted during differentiation, that is while HLXB9 was transcriptionally active. Our findings suggest that HLXB9 can be considered a marker of early neuronal differentiation, possibly involving chromatin remodeling pathways.",,"['Leotta, Claudia Giovanna', 'Federico, Concetta', 'Brundo, Maria Violetta', 'Tosi, Sabrina', 'Saccone, Salvatore']","['Leotta CG', 'Federico C', 'Brundo MV', 'Tosi S', 'Saccone S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/*genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2014/08/20 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/08/20 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0105481 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-19134 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 19;9(8):e105481. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0105481. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0105481 [doi],"['Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Sezione di Biologia Animale, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Sezione di Biologia Animale, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Sezione di Biologia Animale, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Leukaemia and Chromosome Research Laboratory, Division of Biosciences, Brunel University, London, United Kingdom.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Sezione di Biologia Animale, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",PMC4138170,,20140819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this investigation HCC was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in corn oil at 200 mg/kg body weight to rats. Two weeks after DEN administration, cancer development was promoted with dietary 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) (0.02%, w/w) for 2 weeks. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were also determined for confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma induction. Then rat hepatocytes were isolated with collagen perfusion technique and tumoral hepatocytes were sorted by flow cytometry. Finally isolated mitochondria obtained from both tumoral and nontumoral hepatocytes were used for any probable toxic effect of Dracocephalum kotschyi ethanolic extract. Our results showed that D. kotschyi extract (250 microg/mL) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), and mitochondrial swelling and cytochrome c release only in tumoral but not nontumoral hepatocyte.

These cells crowd out normal cells in the bone marrow bringing damage and death. Methotrexate (MTX) is a drug used in the treatment of various cancer and autoimmune diseases. In particular, for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it had significant effect. MTX competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis so as to inhibit purine synthesis. In addition, its downstream metabolite methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) inhibit the thymidylate synthase (TS). Therefore, MTX can inhibit the synthesis of DNA. However, MTX has cytotoxicity and neurotoxin may cause multiple organ injury and is potentially lethal. Thus, the lower toxicity drugs are necessary to be developed. Recently, diseases treatments with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as complements are getting more and more attention. In this study, we attempted to discover the compounds with drug-like potential for ALL treatment from the components in TCM. We applied virtual screen and QSAR models based on structure-based and ligand-based studies to identify the potential TCM component compounds. Our results show that the TCM compounds adenosine triphosphate, manninotriose, raffinose, and stachyose could have potential to improve the side effects of MTX for ALL treatment.",,"['Hsiao, Ya-Li', 'Chang, Pei-Chun', 'Huang, Hung-Jin', 'Kuo, Chia-Chen', 'Chen, Calvin Yu-Chian']","['Hsiao YL', 'Chang PC', 'Huang HJ', 'Kuo CC', 'Chen CY']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,,,2014/08/20 06:00,2014/08/20 06:01,['2014/08/20 06:00'],"['2014/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/601064 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2014;2014:601064. doi: 10.1155/2014/601064.

In the light of protein marker studies to classify subtypes of Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia efficiently, we have compared the lymphoblastes proteome in Childhood ALL in accordance with the presence of t(12;21), indicator of good prognosis, usually. METHODS: Protein expression in pre-B2 lymphoblastic cells, collected from residual bone marrow cells after diagnostic procedures, was analyzed using two dimensional gel electrophoresis protocol. Protein spots whose average normalized volumes were statistically different in the two patients groups (n = 13; student t test p < 0.01), were excised. Tryptic peptides were then analyzed using a nano-LC1200 system coupled to a 6340 Ion Trap mass spectrometer equipped with a HPLC-chip cube interface. The tandem mass spectrometry peak lists extracted using the DataAnalysis program, were compared with the protein database Mascot Daemon. RESULTS: We focused on twelve spots corresponding to sixteen identified candidate proteins among the 26 found differentially expressed (p </= 0.05) regarding the presence of t(12;21). Among over expressed proteins, two proteins were implicated in cellular growth arrest (i.e. calponine 2, p </= 0.001 and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein beta, p </= 0.001) in accordance with good prognosis, while two other proteins favored cell cycle proliferation (i.e. methionine adenosyl transferase 2beta, p </= 0.005 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-proteins A2 p </= 0.01) and could therefore be good marker candidates of aggressiveness. Level of expression of proteasome subunit beta type-2 (p </= 0.01) and protein casein kinase 2alpha (p </= 0.01) which both favored apoptosis, deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB1 (p </= 0.05) and MLL septin-like fusion protein MSF-B, septin 9 i4 (p </= 0.01) were in accord with a good prognosis related to t(12;21) lymphoblasts. CONCLUSION: By drawing up the protein map of leukemic cells, these new data identified marker candidates of leukemic aggressiveness and new t(12;21) patients subgroups. These preliminary results will be in the near future confirmed by using a larger sample of pre-B2 childhood ALLs from national lymphoblastic cell collections.",,"['Costa, Odile', 'Schneider, Pascale', 'Coquet, Laurent', 'Chan, Philippe', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Legrand, Elisabeth', 'Jouenne, Thierry', 'Vasse, Marc', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre']","['Costa O', 'Schneider P', 'Coquet L', 'Chan P', 'Penther D', 'Legrand E', 'Jouenne T', 'Vasse M', 'Vannier JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Proteomics,Clinical proteomics,101184586,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarkers', 'Calponin', 'Childhood ALL', 'OTUB1', 'Protein casein kinase CK2alpha and Ikaros']",2014/08/20 06:00,2014/08/20 06:01,['2014/08/20 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1559-0275-11-31 [doi]', '1559-0275-11-31 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Proteomics. 2014 Aug 1;11(1):31. doi: 10.1186/1559-0275-11-31. eCollection 2014.,11,10.1186/1559-0275-11-31 [doi],"['Laboratoire MERCI, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Rouen, 123 boulevard Gambetta, Rouen, Cedex 76183, France.', ""Laboratoire MERCI, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Rouen, 123 boulevard Gambetta, Rouen, Cedex 76183, France ; Service d'Immuno-Hematologie Onco-pediatrique du CHRU de Rouen, Hopital Charles Nicolle, Rouen 76031, France."", 'PISSARO Proteomic facility, (IRIB), U-Rouen, Mont Saint- Aignan, France ; CNRS UMR 6270, Team << Biofilms, Resistance, Interactions Cellules-Surfaces >>, U-Rouen, Mont Saint-Aignan, France.', 'PISSARO Proteomic facility, (IRIB), U-Rouen, Mont Saint- Aignan, France.', 'Laboratoire de Cytogenetique, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen 76000, France.', 'Laboratoire MERCI, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Rouen, 123 boulevard Gambetta, Rouen, Cedex 76183, France.', 'PISSARO Proteomic facility, (IRIB), U-Rouen, Mont Saint- Aignan, France ; CNRS UMR 6270, Team << Biofilms, Resistance, Interactions Cellules-Surfaces >>, U-Rouen, Mont Saint-Aignan, France.', 'Laboratoire MERCI, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Rouen, 123 boulevard Gambetta, Rouen, Cedex 76183, France.', ""Laboratoire MERCI, Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de Rouen, 123 boulevard Gambetta, Rouen, Cedex 76183, France ; Service d'Immuno-Hematologie Onco-pediatrique du CHRU de Rouen, Hopital Charles Nicolle, Rouen 76031, France.""]",PMC4128613,,20140801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These modifications are in part mediated by the Trithorax group (TrxG) complex and the Polycomb group (PcG) complex, which activate and repress transcription, respectively. We herein investigate the role of Menin, a component of the TrxG complex in T helper (Th) cell differentiation and show a critical role for Menin in differentiation and maintenance of Th17 cells. Menin(-/-) T cells do not efficiently differentiate into Th17 cells, leaving Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation intact in in vitro cultures. Menin deficiency resulted in the attenuation of Th17-induced airway inflammation. In differentiating Th17 cells, Menin directly bound to the Il17a gene locus and was required for the deposition of permissive histone modifications and recruitment of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional complex. Interestingly, although Menin bound to the Rorc locus, Menin was dispensable for the induction of Rorc expression and permissive histone modifications in differentiating Th17 cells. In contrast, Menin was required to maintain expression of Rorc in differentiated Th17 cells, indicating that Menin is essential to stabilize expression of the Rorc gene. Thus, Menin orchestrates Th17 cell differentiation and function by regulating both the induction and maintenance of target gene expression.",,"['Watanabe, Yukiko', 'Onodera, Atsushi', 'Kanai, Urara', 'Ichikawa, Tomomi', 'Obata-Ninomiya, Kazushige', 'Wada, Tomoko', 'Kiuchi, Masahiro', 'Iwamura, Chiaki', 'Tumes, Damon J', 'Shinoda, Kenta', 'Yagi, Ryoji', 'Motohashi, Shinichiro', 'Hirahara, Kiyoshi', 'Nakayama, Toshinori']","['Watanabe Y', 'Onodera A', 'Kanai U', 'Ichikawa T', 'Obata-Ninomiya K', 'Wada T', 'Kiuchi M', 'Iwamura C', 'Tumes DJ', 'Shinoda K', 'Yagi R', 'Motohashi S', 'Hirahara K', 'Nakayama T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Il17a protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Men1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Rorc protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Chromatin/immunology/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-17/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/immunology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/immunology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Ovalbumin/immunology/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/immunology/metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['RNAPII', 'asthma', 'chromatin']",2014/08/20 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2014/08/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1321245111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1321245111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 2;111(35):12829-34. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1321245111.

Herein, we report that the TIM-family proteins strongly inhibit HIV-1 release, resulting in diminished viral production and replication. Expression of TIM-1 causes HIV-1 Gag and mature viral particles to accumulate on the plasma membrane. Mutation of the phosphatidylserine (PS) binding sites of TIM-1 abolishes its ability to block HIV-1 release. TIM-1, but to a much lesser extent PS-binding deficient mutants, induces PS flipping onto the cell surface; TIM-1 is also found to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions. Importantly, TIM-1 inhibits HIV-1 replication in CD4-positive Jurkat cells, despite its capability of up-regulating CD4 and promoting HIV-1 entry. In addition to TIM-1, TIM-3 and TIM-4 also block the release of HIV-1, as well as that of murine leukemia virus (MLV) and Ebola virus (EBOV); knockdown of TIM-3 in differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) enhances HIV-1 production. The inhibitory effects of TIM-family proteins on virus release are extended to other PS receptors, such as Axl and RAGE. Overall, our study uncovers a novel ability of TIM-family proteins to block the release of HIV-1 and other viruses by interaction with virion- and cell-associated PS.

It is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or malignancies. PG is a diagnosis of exclusion, and it is based on clinical presentation, histology, history of an underlying disease, and exclusion of other causes of ulceration. CASE REPORT: The authors report a 62-year-old male who developed a nonhealing ulcer at the site of incision following nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Past medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with rituximab. Histology of the skin lesion showed a phlegmonous nonspecific inflammation without being able to differentiate between a necrotizing wound infection and PG. The patient's condition was initially diagnosed as an infectious process and treated accordingly. After unsuccessful results with systemic antibiotics, high-dose corticosteroids induced prompt healing of the wound. On these bases, the diagnosis of postoperative PG within chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal cell carcinoma was made. CONCLUSION: Faced with postoperative necrotizing ulceration resistant to correctly administered antibiotics, PG must be considered. In such condition, the diagnosis must not be guided primarily by histology and early advice of a dermatologist is recommended.",,"['Solovan, Caius', 'Smiszek, Robert', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Chiticariu, Elena']","['Solovan C', 'Smiszek R', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Chiticariu E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Infect Dis Ther,Infectious diseases and therapy,101634499,,,,,,2013/06/01 00:00,2013/06/01 00:01,['2014/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40121-013-0008-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Dis Ther. 2013 Jun;2(1):75-80. doi: 10.1007/s40121-013-0008-4.

We retrospectively analyzed 74 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent allo-HSCT between August 2006 and September 2012. All recipients were CMV seropositive. In 52 patients, eCMV occurred at a median of 35 days (range, 11-92) after allo-HSCT. Univariate analysis revealed that the factors associated with a reduction in the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) included the first complete remission status at allo-HSCT, non-adverse cytogenetics and molecular abnormalities, pre-transplant serum ferritin level <1,400 mg/dL, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), and eCMV. In sub-group analysis, according to the existence of eCMV and cGVHD, those with both eCMV and cGVHD showed the lowest 5-year CIR (P < 0.003). Patients with both eCMV and cGVHD had the best outcome for leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P < 0.001) and OS (P < 0.001). In the CMV-seropositive population, the presence of eCMV in combination with cGVHD had a significant positive effect on LFS and OS after allo-HSCT. When eCMV preceded cGVHD, the relapse rate after allo-HSCT was significantly reduced in patients with AML.

Some of its characteristics endorse the growing popularity of LLO for use in biotechnology, particularly in the development of novel vaccines.

The LLO preparation procedure was optimized and purified LLO was tested for optimal conditions of storage including temperature, application of proteinase inhibitors and serum components. We demonstrated the possibility of regulating LLO activity by adjusting cell membrane cholesterol content. The LLO preparation had haemolytic activity and had a cytotoxic effect on the human T-leukaemia Jurkat cell line as well as mouse and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: LLO has a very potent cytotoxic activity towards human leukocytes.

PITHD1 was significantly downregulated in leukemia and upregulated upon PMA induction in K562 cells undergoing megakaryocyte differentiation. We aimed to study the function of PITHD1 in megakaryocyte differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells and fetal liver cells were used for either overexpression or downregulation of PITHD1 by retroviral or lentiviral transduction. FACS was used to detect the expression of CD41 and CD42 to measure megakaryocyte differentiation in these cells. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR were used to measure gene expression. Dual luciferase assay was used to detect promoter or internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) activity. RESULTS: Ectopic expression of PITHD1 promoted megakaryocyte differentiation and increased RUNX1 expression while PITHD1 knockdown showed an opposite phenotype. Furthermore, PITHD1 efficiently induced endogenous RUNX1 expression and restored megakaryocyte differentiation suppressed by a dominant negative form of RUNX1. PITHD1 regulated RUNX1 expression at least through two distinct mechanisms: increasing transcription activity of proximal promoter and enhancing translation activity of an IRES element in exon 3. Finally, we confirmed the function of PITHD1 in regulating RUNX1 expression and megakaryopoiesis in mouse fetal liver cells. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: PITHD1 was a novel activator of IRES and enhanced RUNX1 expression that subsequently promoted megakaryocyte differentiation.

In this study, we investigated whether intermediate pluripotent states could be available by manipulating the culture condition during the process of generating pig induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs). By optimizing the culture condition that efficiently promotes mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), we found that combination of three growth factors (LIF, FGF2 and BMP4) and two inhibitors (2i: CHIR99021 and SB431542) could generate an intermediate pluripotent state of piPSCs, which were named as LFB2i-piPSCs. The LFB2i-piPSCs are stable and fulfill all the criteria of pluripotency, including expression of pluripotent genes, differentiation into three germ layers via embryoid bodies in vitro and teratoma in vivo. More importantly, the mRNA-sequencing data showed that LFB2i-piPSCs had a mixed transcriptome of naive and primed pluripotency, which featured by expressing high levels of SOX2, L-MYC and ESRRB and relatively low levels of POU5F1, KLF4 and NANOG. Small RNA sequencing also demonstrated that LFB2i-piPSCs had a mixed microRNA profile of naive and primed pluripotency, which featured by expressing high levels of miR-302b/367 cluster and miR-106a/363 cluster, and low levels of most let-7 family members and miR-17/92 cluster. Altogether, the LFB2i-piPSCs represent a stable intermediate pluripotent state with unique transcriptome and microRNA signatures.

In contrast, it is largely unknown why some patients fail TKI therapy despite continued suppression of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity, a situation termed BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent TKI resistance. Here, we identified activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by extrinsic or intrinsic mechanisms as an essential feature of BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent TKI resistance. By combining synthetic chemistry, in vitro reporter assays, and molecular dynamics-guided rational inhibitor design and high-throughput screening, we discovered BP-5-087, a potent and selective STAT3 SH2 domain inhibitor that reduces STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear transactivation. Computational simulations, fluorescence polarization assays and hydrogen-deuterium exchange assays establish direct engagement of STAT3 by BP-5-087 and provide a high-resolution view of the STAT3 SH2 domain/BP-5-087 interface. In primary cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent TKI resistance, BP-5-087 (1.0 muM) restored TKI sensitivity to therapy-resistant CML progenitor cells, including leukemic stem cells.

It is unclear if and when monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that stimulate antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) can be used for treatment because this depends on the presence of functional effector cells. Here, we used flow cytometry to determine that patient samples at diagnosis, post-induction and relapse contain detectable numbers of CD56+ cells. We were able to selectively expand CD56+ immune effector cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples at diagnosis and at various stages of treatment by co-culture with artificial antigen-presenting K562 clone 9.mbIL-21 cells. Amplified CD56+CD3- cells had spontaneous and anti-B cell-activating factor receptor mAb-stimulated ADCC activity against allogeneic ALL cells, which could be further enhanced by IL-15. Importantly, matched CD56+ effector cells also killed autologous ALL cells grown out from leukemia samples of the same patient, through both spontaneous as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

The BCR/ABL hybrid gene, involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), could be transferred from K562 EVs to neutrophils and decrease their phagocytic activity in vitro. Our present study provides evidence that BCR/ABL DNAs transferred from EVs have pathophysiological significance in vivo. Two months after injection of K562 EVs into the tail vein of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, they showed some characteristics of CML, e.g., feeble, febrile, and thin, with splenomegaly and neutrophilia but with reduced neutrophil phagocytic activity. These findings were also observed in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice treated with K562 EVs; BCR/ABL mRNA and protein were found in their neutrophils.

Despite these successes, much of the heritable variation in NHL risk remains to be explained. Common copy-number variants are important genomic sources of variability, and hence a potential source to explain part of this missing heritability. In this study, we carried out a CNV analysis using GWAS data from 681 NHL cases and 749 controls to explore the relationship between common structural variation and lymphoma susceptibility. Here we found a novel association with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) risk involving a partial duplication of the C-terminus region of the LOC283177 long non-coding RNA that was further confirmed by quantitative PCR.

Drugs that target the function of key epigenetic factors have been approved in the context of haematopoietic disorders, and mutations that affect chromatin modulators in a variety of leukaemias have recently been identified; however, 'epigenetic' drugs are not currently used for T-ALL treatment. Recently, we described that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has a tumour-suppressor role in T-ALL. Here we delineated the role of the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in T-ALL. We show that JMJD3 is essential for the initiation and maintenance of T-ALL, as it controls important oncogenic gene targets by modulating H3K27 methylation. By contrast, we found that UTX functions as a tumour suppressor and is frequently genetically inactivated in T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor GSKJ4 (ref. 5) affects T-ALL growth, by targeting JMJD3 activity.

However, efficacy of DLI is limited in most hematologic cancers. As antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells (DC) bolster immune responses. We conducted a Phase I trial testing the coinfusion of DC followed by DLI. DC were generated by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA matched-related donors in GM-CSF and IL-4 for 7 days, followed by TNF-alpha for 3 days. DC were administered intravenously on 3 dose levels (5 x 10(6) ; 1 x 10(7) ; 5 x 10(7) cells). DLI (3 x 10(7) CD3+ cells/kg) was administered intravenously 1 day after the DC. Sixteen patients with hematologic cancers relapsed after HSCT were treated. A maximum tolerated dose for DC was not reached. Two of 16 patients met criteria for DLT within 10 weeks of the infusion: 1 idiopathic respiratory failure, 1 ventricular cardiac arrest. None developed grade III/IV GVHD. One patient developed grade II acute intestinal graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and 1 chronic GVHD within 6 months of the infusion. Both resolved with corticosteroids. Four of 14 patients evaluable for disease response achieved durable remissions and are alive and cancer free 6.7, 8.4, 8.8, and 10.1 years from infusion. Sequential infusion of donor-derived DC with DLI is feasible in patients with relapsed hematologic cancers after allogeneic HSCT. Future studies may consider donor DC preloaded with tumor antigens to investigate whether DC infusion could augment the GVL effect.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ho, Vincent T', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Kao, Grace', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Levine, James', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Joyce, Robin', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Avigan, David', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd']","['Ho VT', 'Kim HT', 'Kao G', 'Cutler C', 'Levine J', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Joyce R', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J', 'Avigan D', 'Alyea EP 3rd']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology/*transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/pathology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,,2014/08/19 06:00,2015/01/17 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23825 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Dec;89(12):1092-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23825.

Therapy with azacitidine at a dose of 75 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days appears to be better tolerated, and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of elderly AML patients with bone marrow (BM) blast counts of 20-30%. Here, we report the results of a prospective, phase 2, open-label study that evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of a 5-day regimen of single-agent subcutaneous azacitidine 100 mg/m(2)/day administered every 28 days in 15 elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML, 14 of whom had BM blast counts >30%. The overall response rate was 47%. Complete remission, partial remission, and hematologic improvement were achieved by 20, 13, and 13% of patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 355 days for the entire cohort, and 532 days for responders. Median time to best response was 95 days, and median treatment duration was 198 days (range = 13-724 days). Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities comprised predominantly febrile neutropenia (40%) and thrombocytopenia (20%). Febrile neutropenia was the most common cause of hospitalization. Nonhematologic toxicities, consisting of injection-site skin reactions and fatigue (Grades 1-2), occurred in 73% (n = 11) of patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. The dose and schedule of therapy remained constant in all but four patients.

This study investigates insulin sensitivity, beta-cell reserve and pancreatic volume in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHOD: Survivors (aged 16-26 years) of ALL treated with BMT/TBI (10-14.4 Gy) Group 1 (n = 20, 10 m) were compared with a chemotherapy-only Group 2 (n = 28, 11 m). Participants underwent assessments of insulin sensitivity by whole body composite-insulin-sensitivity-index (ISIcomp ) from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs); first (AIRarg , AIRg , AUCin10 ) and second (AUC in second phase ) phase insulin responses from arginine-intravenous glucose tolerance tests; and pancreatic volume by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data were analysed by odds ratio, Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, Student's t-tests, analysis of covariance (ancova) and Pearson's or partial correlations (5% significance). RESULTS: Abnormal OGTTs were documented in Group 1 (DM = 2, IGT = 7). Insulin secretion adjusted for insulin sensitivity was lower in Group 1 than Group 2 as a whole [LogAIRarg (P = 0.008), logAIRg (P = 0.013) and logAUCin10 (P = 0.014)] and after exclusion of those with abnormal glucose tolerance [logAIRarg (P = 0.011), logAIRg (P = 0.007) and logAUCin10 (P = 0.006)]. Group 1 had lower pancreatic volume than Group 2 [52.0 (14.2) vs 72.8 (23.5), P = 0.001] cm(3) , and results were consistent after adjustment for size by body surface area (P = 0.019). Pancreatic volume correlated with logAIRarg adjusted log ISIcomp (partial correlation = 0.34, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood BMT/TBI for ALL demonstrated reduced beta-cell reserve and smaller pancreatic volume, both likely additional aetiological factors, with reduced insulin sensitivity, in their increased risk of diabetes.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wei, Christina', 'Thyagiarajan, Manigandan', 'Hunt, Linda', 'Cox, Rachel', 'Bradley, Karin', 'Elson, Ruth', 'Hamilton-Shield, Julian', 'Stevens, Michael', 'Crowne, Elizabeth']","['Wei C', 'Thyagiarajan M', 'Hunt L', 'Cox R', 'Bradley K', 'Elson R', 'Hamilton-Shield J', 'Stevens M', 'Crowne E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/*physiology', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Pancreas/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Survivors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/08/19 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cen.12575 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2015 Jan;82(1):59-67. doi: 10.1111/cen.12575.

We found that clinically reported BCR-ABL1 compound mutants center on 12 key positions and confer varying resistance to imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, rebastinib, and bosutinib. T315I-inclusive compound mutants confer high-level resistance to TKIs, including ponatinib. In vitro resistance profiling was predictive of treatment outcomes in Ph(+) leukemia patients.

Here, we characterise the cellular response to the dual-acting agent, Alchemix (ALX), which is a modified anthraquinone that functions as a topoisomerase inhibitor as well as an alkylating agent. We show that ALX induces a robust DDR at nano-molar concentrations and this is mediated primarily through ATR- and DNA-PK- but not ATM-dependent pathways, despite DNA double strand breaks being generated after prolonged exposure to the drug. Interestingly, exposure of epithelial tumour cell lines to ALX in vitro resulted in potent activation of the G2/M checkpoint, which after a prolonged arrest, was bypassed allowing cells to progress into mitosis where they ultimately died by mitotic catastrophe. We also observed effective killing of lymphoid tumour cell lines in vitro following exposure to ALX, although, in contrast, this tended to occur via activation of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway. Lastly, we validate the effectiveness of ALX as a chemotherapeutic agent in vivo by demonstrating its ability to cause a significant reduction in tumour cell growth, irrespective of TP53 status, using a mouse leukaemia xenograft model. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ALX, through its dual action as an alkylating agent and topoisomerase inhibitor, represents a novel anti-cancer agent that could be potentially used clinically to treat refractory or relapsed tumours, particularly those harbouring mutations in DDR genes.",,"['Thomas, A', 'Perry, T', 'Berhane, S', 'Oldreive, C', 'Zlatanou, A', 'Williams, L R', 'Weston, V J', 'Stankovic, T', 'Kearns, P', 'Pors, K', 'Grand, R J', 'Stewart, G S']","['Thomas A', 'Perry T', 'Berhane S', 'Oldreive C', 'Zlatanou A', 'Williams LR', 'Weston VJ', 'Stankovic T', 'Kearns P', 'Pors K', 'Grand RJ', 'Stewart GS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Alchemix)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/08/19 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014266 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.266 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jun;34(25):3336-48. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.266.

Here, we show that CHK1 is overexpressed and hyperactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). CHEK1 mRNA is highly abundant in patients of the proliferative T-ALL subgroup and leukemia cells exhibit constitutively elevated levels of the replication stress marker phospho-RPA32 and the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 using PF-004777736 or CHK1 short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing impairs T-ALL cell proliferation and viability. CHK1 inactivation results in the accumulation of cells with incompletely replicated DNA, ensuing DNA damage, ATM/CHK2 activation and subsequent ATM- and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. In contrast to normal thymocytes, primary T-ALL cells are sensitive to therapeutic doses of PF-004777736, even in the presence of stromal or interleukin-7 survival signals. Moreover, CHK1 inhibition significantly delays in vivo growth of xenotransplanted T-ALL tumors. We conclude that CHK1 is critical for T-ALL proliferation and viability by downmodulating replication stress and preventing ATM/caspase-3-dependent cell death.

The majority of the rearrangements fall within a 7.3-kb MLL breakpoint cluster region (MLLbcr), particularly in a 0.4-kb hotspot at the intron11-exon12 boundary. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, though multiple pathways including early apoptotic signaling, accompanied by high-order DNA fragmentation, have been implicated. We introduced the MLLbcr hotspot in an EGFP-based recombination reporter system and demonstrated enhancement of both spontaneous and genotoxic treatment-induced DNA recombination by the MLLbcr in various human cell types. We identified Endonuclease G (EndoG), an apoptotic nuclease, as an essential factor for MLLbcr-specific DNA recombination after induction of replication stress. We provide evidence for replication stress-induced nuclear accumulation of EndoG, DNA binding by EndoG as well as cleavage of the chromosomal MLLbcr locus in a manner requiring EndoG. We demonstrate additional dependency of MLLbcr breakage on ATM signaling to histone H2B monoubiquitinase RNF20, involved in chromatin relaxation. Altogether our findings provide a novel mechanism underlying MLLbcr destabilization in the cells of origin of leukemogenesis, with replication stress-activated, EndoG-mediated cleavage at the MLLbcr, which may serve resolution of the stalled forks via recombination repair, however, also permits MLL rearrangements.",,"['Gole, B', 'Baumann, C', 'Mian, E', 'Ireno, C I', 'Wiesmuller, L']","['Gole B', 'Baumann C', 'Mian E', 'Ireno CI', 'Wiesmuller L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/physiology', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Breaks', 'DNA Repair/physiology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects/*genetics', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic/drug effects']",,,2014/08/19 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014268 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.268 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jun;34(26):3391-401. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.268.

Particularly, the miRNAs mediated gene regulation involves the modulation of multiple mRNAs and cooperative action of different miRNAs to regulate a particular gene expression. This highly complex array of regulatory pathway network indicates the great possibility in analyzing and identifying novel findings. Owing to the conventional, slow experimental identification process of miRNAs and their targets, the last decade has witnessed the development of a large amount of computational approaches to deal with the complex interrelations present within biological systems.

Cells obtained from follicular fluid grew in vitro under minimal medium conditions, without growth factor, including leukaemia-inhibiting factor. Morphological analysis revealed a heterogeneous cell population, with cells displaying a fibroblast-like, epithelial-like and also neuron-like features. Morpho-functional characteristics of fibroblast-like cells were similar to mesenchymal stem cells, and, in particular, were positive for mesenchymal stemness markers, including CD90, CD44, CD105, CD73, but negative for epithelial proteins, such as cytokeratins, CD34 and CD45 antigens. Cell proliferation activity at different times and colony-forming unit capability were evaluated, and multipotency of a subset of granulosa cells was established by in-vitro differentiation studies (e.g. osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation). This study suggests that cells provided by mesenchymal plasticity can be easily isolated by waste follicular fluid, avoiding scraping of human ovaries, and cultivated in minimal conditions. Successful growth of such progenitor cells on three-dimensional cryogel scaffold provides the basis for future developments in tissue engineering. This culture system may be regarded as an experimental model in which biological behaviour is not influenced by specific growth factors.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

Rare B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas harboring KMT2A translocations have been reported, but information regarding the clinical behavior of such cases is limited. Here, we describe two extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs): a primary thyroid DLBCL and a large cell transformation of a splenic marginal zone lymphoma, which displayed complex karyotypes and translocations involving chromosome 11q23 targeting the KMT2A gene. The pathological and clinical characteristics of these cases are discussed in the context of previously reported lymphomas associated with different types of KMT2A genetic aberrations. In contrast to the poor clinical outcomes of patients with acute leukemias and myeloid neoplasms associated with KMT2A translocations, patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, exhibiting similar translocations, appear to respond well to immunochemotherapy. Our findings add to the growing list of histone methyltransferase genes deregulated in DLBCL and highlight the diversity of mechanisms, altering the function of epigenetic modifier genes in lymphomas.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Gindin, Tatyana', 'Murty, Vundavalli', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Bhagat, Govind']","['Gindin T', 'Murty V', 'Alobeid B', 'Bhagat G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['KMT2A', 'MLL', 'cytogenetics', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'rearrangement', 'translocation']",2014/08/19 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2158 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2015 Dec;33(4):239-46. doi: 10.1002/hon.2158.

DATA SOURCES: We collected the relevant articles in PubMed (from 1985 to present), using the terms ""mixed phenotype acute leukemia"", ""hybrid acute leukemia"", ""biphenotypic acute leukemia"", and ""mixed lineage leukemia"". We also collected the relevant studies in WanFang Data base (from 2000 to present), using the terms ""mixed phenotype acute leukemia"" and ""hybrid acute leukemia"". STUDY SELECTION: We included all relevant studies concerning mixed phenotype acute leukemia in English and Chinese version, with no limitation of research design. The duplicated articles are excluded. RESULTS: MPAL is a rare subgroup of acute leukemia which expresses the myeloid and lymphoid markers simultaneously. The clinical manifestations of MPAL are similar to other acute leukemias. The World Health Organization classification and the European Group for Immunological classification of Leukaemias 1998 criteria are most widely used. MPAL does not have a standard therapy regimen. Its treatment depends mostly on the patient's unique immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features, and also the experience of individual physician. The lack of effective treatment contributes to an undesirable prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our understanding about MPAL is still limited. The diagnostic criteria have not been unified. The treatment of MPAL remains to be investigated. The prognostic factor is largely unclear yet.

We aimed to assess the use of the Edinburgh selection criteria for ovarian tissue cryopreservation in girls and young women with cancer to determine whether we are offering this invasive procedure to the patients who are most at risk of premature ovarian insufficiency. METHODS: Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue has been selectively offered to girls and young women with cancer who met the Edinburgh selection criteria since 1996. Between Jan 1, 1996, and June 30, 2012, 410 female patients younger than 18 years at diagnosis were treated for cancer (including leukaemia and brain tumours) at the Edinburgh Children's Cancer Centre, which serves the whole South East of Scotland region. We determined the ovarian status of these patients from review of clinical records and classified them as having premature ovarian insufficiency or not, or as unable to be determined. Patients younger than 12 years at time of data cutoff (Jan 31, 2013) were excluded from the analysis. FINDINGS: 34 (8%) of the 410 patients met the Edinburgh selection criteria and were offered ovarian tissue cryopreservation before starting cancer treatment. 13 patients declined the procedure and 21 consented, and the procedure was completed successfully in 20 patients. Of the 20 patients who had ovarian tissue successfully cryopreserved, 14 were available for assessment of ovarian function. Of the 13 patients who had declined the procedure, six were available for assessment of ovarian function. Median age at the time of follow-up for the 20 assessable patients was 16.9 years (IQR 15.5-21.8). Of the 14 assessable patients who had successfully undergone ovarian cryopreservation, six had developed premature ovarian insufficiency at a median age of 13.4 years (IQR 12.5-14.6), one of whom also had a natural pregnancy. Of the six assessable patients who had declined the procedure, one had developed premature ovarian insufficiency. Assessment of ovarian function was possible for 141 of the 376 patients who were not offered cryopreservation; one of these patients had developed premature ovarian insufficiency. The cumulative probability of developing premature ovarian insufficiency after treatment was completed was significantly higher for patients who met the criteria for ovarian tissue cryopreservation than for those who did not (15-year probability 35% [95% CI 10-53] vs 1% [0-2]; p<0.0001; hazard ratio 56.8 [95% CI 6.2-521.6] at 10 years). INTERPRETATION: The results of this analysis show that the Edinburgh selection criteria accurately identify the few girls and young women who will develop premature ovarian insufficiency, and validate their use for selection of patients for ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Further follow-up of this cohort of patients is likely to allow refinement of the criteria for this experimental procedure in girls and young women with cancer.

The current report summarizes the outcome of 27 T-PLL cases identified in the registry in French Society for stem cell transplantation (SFGM-TC). Prior to HSCT, 14 patients were in complete remission (CR), 10 in partial response, three refractory, or in progression. Following HSCT, 21 patients achieved CR as best response. With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 33 (range, 6-103) months, 10 patients are still alive in continuous CR. Overall survival and progression-free survival estimates at 3 yr were 36% (95% CI: 17-54%) and 26% (95% CI: 14-45%), respectively. The relapse incidence after HSCT was 47% occurring at a median of 11.7 (range, 2-24) months. Overall cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality was 31% at 3 yr.

But, at present, there are no specific methods to remove leukaemia stem cells independently, possibly the combination of LSC immune phenotype with blocking the microenvironment signaling pathways can target at and remove LSC, thus improving the prognosis of leukemia.",,"['Liu, Bo', 'Shi, Ce', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Liu B', 'Shi C', 'Zhou J']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2014/08/19 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2014)04-1120-04 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2014.04.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Aug;22(4):1120-3. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2014.04.044.,22,10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2014.04.044 [doi],"['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang Province, China.

Clinical data of 20 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia in Department of Hematology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from 2008 January to 2014 April were retrospectively analyzed, in which 5 cases were with myeloid antigen (My(+) ALL), while 15 patients were without myeloid antigen expression (My(-) ALL). Differences in prognosis and hematopoietic reconstitution post-allo-HSCT were observed in My(+) ALL and My(-) ALL patients. The results showed that the poor platelet engraftment in patients with My(+) ALL was found more than that in My(-)ALL patients. Three My(+) ALL patients experienced skin chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) including local in 2 cases and extensive in one case, and 3 My(-) ALL patients developed grade I-II acute GVHD, while five patients of My(-) ALL experienced cGVHD including local in 3 cases, extensive in 2 cases. One and two year overall survival rate of My(+) ALL and My(-) ALL patients was 80% and 85.7%, 53% and 69.8% respectively, one and two year progress-free survival rate was 53.3% and 54.7%, 26% and 27.4%, respectively.

The expression of T-box (T-bet), GATA-3, ROR-gammat and Foxp3 mRNA in PBMNC were examined by RT-PCR in 42 cases of MDS, including 22 refractory anemia(MDS-RA) and 20 refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB), in 23 cases of AA, 17 cases of AML patients and 16 healthy volunteers respectively. The results indicated that, compared with normal control group, expressions of T-bet and RORgammat mRNA in AA patient group were significantly higher (P < 0.01), expression levels of GATA3 Foxp3 mRNA were lower (both P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in expression of T-bet and GATA3 mRNA between MDS group and normal control group, but the expression levels of Foxp3 and RORgammat mRNA were higher than those in normal controls (P < 0.05); T-bet and RORgammat in MDS-RA group were higher than those in the normal controls(P < 0.01), and GATA3 expression significantly reduced (P < 0.05), however, there was no significant difference in expression of Foxp3 between MDS-RA and the controls.

The clinical data of 76 elderly ( >/= 60 old years) AML (non-APL) patients from January 2000 to January 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. According to treatment methods,the 76 patients were divided into 2 groups: induction chemotherapy group (51 cases) and best supportive treatment group (25 cases). The patients in induction chemotherapy group received the cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy regimens, including DA, MA, HA, IA and CAG; the patients in best supportive treatment group received supportive treatment including hydroxyurea, blood transfusion and so on. The clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis between 2 groups were compared. The results showed that the median survival times of patients in induction chemotherapy and best supportive treatment groups were 5 (0.2-89) and 3 (0.1-17) months respectively, there was significantly statistical difference in median survival time between 2 groups(P < 0.01) suggesting that the induction chemotherapy obviously prolonged the survival time of elderly CML patients. The 5 patients in induction chemotherapy group survived more than 60 months, one of them survived more than nine years. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rate of patients was 19.6% (10/51), partial remission (PR) rate was 19.6% (10/51), the overall response rate (ORR) was 39.2%, the mortality of patients in induction remission stage was 13.7% (7/51) in induction chemotherapy group; no 1 case in best supportive treatment group reached to CR. The CR rate of patients by using MA regimen was 44.4% and its ORR was 55.5%, which was higher than that by using DA, HA, IA and CAG regimens. The median chemotherapy cycles were 3 (1-14). The follow-up found that the 3 months-survival rate of patients was 65% and 42%, the 6 month-survival rate of patients was 43% and 21%, the 1 year-survival rate of patients was 29% and 13%, the 5 year-survival rate of patients was 13% and 0% in induction chemotherapy and best supportive treatment groups respectively, showing that the survival of patients in induction chemotherapy group was better than those in best supportive treatment group. A total of 31 of out 51 cases (60.8%) in induction chemotherapy group not response to the first cycle of chemotherapy, the survival time of these patients was not statistically significantly different from that of patients in best supportive treatment group. It is concluded that the induction chemotherapy can significantly improve the prognosis of elderly patients with AML, and prolong their median survival time. The induction remission rate in elderly patients with AML is lower than that of younger patients. The MA regimen is better than DA, HA, IA and CAG, there is individual difference in the elderly patients with AML, If the first cycle of chemotherapy has not reached to CR or PR, the best supportive treatment may be considered.

The clinical data including clinical indicators, treatment protocols, curative effect and prognosis were analyzed retrospectively. The results showed that after normalized chemotherapy, there were 4 patients with complete remission at the first cycle of treatment, 4 patients with complete remission at the second cycle, 4 patients with complete remission at the third cycle, but one patient without complete remission after 4 cycles. There were 6 patients who did not relapse during consolidation and intensive therapy. Among these 6 patients, 4 cases accepted chemotherapy combined with transplantation, other 2 cases accepted chemotherapy. In the remainder 6 patients, 4 cases relapsed once, one cases relapsed twice, 1 cases relapsed for three times.

Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation; CEC were sorted by MACS and harvested in the endothelial growth medium. The morphologic features of CEC were observed by microscopy, the cell growth rate was calculated by cell counting, and the cells were identified by immunofluorescence staining for the expression of CD31,CD34,VWF and CD133. The expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene was examined by FISH in 12 CML patients. The results indicated that the isolated CEC displayed the typical cobble-stone morphology. These cells could be identified by the positive immunofluorescence staining for CD31, CD34 and VWF, and showed more increased proliferative potential as compared to that of healthy donors. It was found that the positive rate of CD133 was 31.29% in CML patients, which was significantly different from that of healthy donors (P < 0.05). In 12 CML patients, CEC carried the same chromosome aberration as the leukemia cells (10.77%).

Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from newly diagnosed AML patients (n = 33), complete remission AML patients (n = 19), relapsed/refractory AML patients (n = 12) and iron deficiency anemia patients (control group, n = 15). Expression of TFPI-2 mRNA was detected with real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and the methylation of CpG island in its promoter was detected with methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The results showed that the expression of TFPI-2 mRNA in newly diagnosed AML, complete remission AML and relapsed/refractory AML patients was much lower than that in the controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, its expression in relapsed/refractory AML patients was lower than that in newly diagnosed AML patients (P = 0.006). Compared with complete remission AML patients, the expression of TFPI-2 mRNA in newly diagnosed AML patients was significantly reduced (P = 0.030). The percentage of TFPI-2 promoter methylation in AML patients was 64.63% (42/64).

Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from bone marrow of CLL patients and healthy donors and then were cultured, hBMSC were established by expanding for at least five passages. The mRNA expression of adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), was analyzed by real-time PCR. The mRNA and protein expression of lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The individual NF-kappaB members at protein level of CLL-hBMSC and N-hBMSC were examined by Western blot. The effect of LTalpha1beta2 on individual NF-kappaB family members at protein level in CLL-hBMSC and N-hBMSC was also examined by Western blot. The death of CLL cells was determined by flow cytometry with PI staining when cultured with or without CLL-hBMSC and N-hBMSC at different time points. The results showed that the hBMSC could be established successfully from bone marrow of CLL patients, which were similar to N-hBMSC. Adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, were found to be expressed at similar mRNA levels in CLL-hBMSC and N-hBMSC. LTbetaR expressions at mRNA and protein levels were comparable between CLL-hBMSC and N-hBMSC. The protein expression of the individual NF-kappaB family members could be detected in CLL-hBMSC and N-hBMSC with similar expression levels.

To further investigate the mechanism of Ph(+) ALL fast relapse after TKI treatment, ABL KD mutation in 35 Chinese Ph(+) ALL with TKI resistance was detected by direct sequencing. The results showed that 77.1% (27/35) Ph(+) ALL patients with TKI resistance had ABL KD mutation and 55.6% (15/27) Ph(+) ALL patients with ABL KD mutation had T315I. Interestingly, 77.8% (21/27) Ph(+)ALL showed ABL mutation G: C-->A:T, including T315I, E255K and E459K. Furthermore, all the Ph(+) ALL patients with two or more ABL KD mutations collaborated with complex chromosome abnormality and all the TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL patients, whose karyotype progressed from simple t (9;22) into complex, developed ABL KD mutation. Moreover, the expression level of uracil-DNA glycosylase UNG2, which inhibits G:C-->A:T transition in genomic DNA, decreased in Ph(+) ALL with TKI-resistance compared to that in newly diagnosis Ph(+) ALL. It is concluded that there is a high frequent ABL KD G:C-->A:T mutation and a high genomic instability in Chinese TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study, we examined the medical records of all consecutive patients with ALL admitted to a public hospital in Brazil from 1990 to 2005. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients included, 88 were treated with 2 protocols of chemotherapy (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster [BFM] 86 modified [BFM-86M] and UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] protocol). The complete remission (CR), disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rate was 70.6%, 27%, and 30.5%, respectively (median follow-up, 49 months). Age < 18 years and no leukemic infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS) at diagnosis were positively associated with CR (P = .03); no bleeding and hepatomegaly at diagnosis and age < 35 years were associated with better OS on multivariate analyses of the whole population (P = .01). OS at 4 years was superior with BFM-86M than with UCLA (49.5% vs. 16%; P = .004), especially in young adults without risk factors. CONCLUSION: We identified age as the most important prognostic factor in patients with ALL. CNS infiltration, hepatomegaly, and bleeding were associated with lower OS but must be validated in future research with South American populations and worldwide. The BFM-86M protocol can be considered a therapeutic option for young adults (age < 35 years) without adverse prognostic factors.

Left ventricular dysfunction is documented in these survivors, but less is known about right ventricular (RV) function. Quantitative echocardiography may help detect subclinical RV dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess RV function quantitatively in childhood cancer survivors after lung-toxic therapy. PROCEDURES: We identified records of 33 childhood cancer survivors who (1) were treated with lung-toxic therapy and/or radiation, (2) were cancer-free for >/= one year after therapy, and (3) had pulmonary function tests and echocardiograms from their most recent follow-up visit. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 11.6 +/- 4.5 years at cancer diagnosis and 23 +/- 8.6 years at evaluation. The most common diagnosis was lymphoma/leukemia (n = 27). Twenty-nine subjects had anthracycline exposure. Eleven of the 33 subjects demonstrated restrictive pulmonary impairment (total lung capacity 3.69 +/- 1.5 L [69.3 +/- 22.4% predicted]). Among quantitative measures of RV function, isovolumetric acceleration (IVA), a measure of contractility, was significantly lower in the group with restrictive lung disease (2.42 +/- 0.56 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.78 m/sec(2); P < 0.05). There was a trend towards lower tissue Doppler derived S' and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion in the group with restrictive lung disease. Subjects with restrictive lung disease were found to have >/= 2 abnormal parameters (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IVA may detect early RV dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors with restrictive lung disease.

The review summarizes different published co-cultivation studies of THP-1 cells with other cell types, for instance, intestinal cells, adipocytes, T-lymphocytes, platelets, and vascular smooth muscle cells, which can be an option to study cell-cell interaction in vitro and can be an approach to better mimic in vivo conditions. Macrophage polarization is a relatively new topic which gains interest for which the THP-1 cell line also may be relevant. Besides that an overview of newly released commercial THP-1 engineered-reporter cells and THP-1 inflammasome test-cells is also given. Evaluation of recent papers leads to the conclusion that the THP-1 cell line has unique characteristics as a model to investigate/estimate immune-modulating effects of compounds in both activated and resting conditions of the cells. Although the THP-1 response can hint to potential responses that might occur ex vivo or in vivo, these should be, however, validated by in vivo studies to draw more definite conclusions.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies showed that 10 nM estradiol enhanced MLL transcription in addition to its common translocation partners, MLLT2 (AF4) and MLLT3 (AF9). The same concentration of estradiol triggered MLL and MLLT3 co-localization without affecting the interaction of genes located on the same chromosomes. Estradiol also stimulated the generation of MLL-MLLT3 fusion transcripts as seen by RT-PCR. RNAi knockdown of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) suppressed the induction of MLL-MLLT3 fusion transcript formation observed with estradiol. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed estradiol dependent localization of AICDA in MLL intron 11, upstream of a hotspot for both DNA cleavage and rearrangement, but not downstream within intron 12. Combined, these studies show that levels of estradiol consistent with that observed during pregnancy have the potential to initiate MLL fusions through an AICDA-mediated mechanism.",,"['Wright, Rebecca L', 'Slemmons, Katherine K', 'Vaughan, Andrew T M']","['Wright RL', 'Slemmons KK', 'Vaughan AT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-MLLT3 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genetic Loci', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['3C', 'AICDA', 'IAL', 'MLL', 'MLLT3', 'estradiol']",2014/08/19 06:00,2016/03/26 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.954112 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 May;56(5):1460-5. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.954112.

The present study was directed to understand the contribution of MALT-1 and deubiquitinase CYLD to the initiation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Such a study revealed for the first time that the 35kDa CYLD cleaved factor generated by MALT-1 mediated proteolytic cleavage was conspicuously present in human T- ALL subjects of pediatric age group. Further, over-expression of this 35kDa CYLD factor within normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells had the inherent capacity to program the genome of these cells resulting in T-cell lineage ALL.

Six hundred and twenty-seven patients were randomized to either arm. Overall the combination of lumiliximab with FCR was not significantly better than FCR alone (overall response rate 71% vs. 72%, complete response rate 16% vs. 15%, median progression-free survival 24.6 vs. 23.9 months respectively, for FCR with and without lumiliximab). There was a slightly increased incidence of adverse events with lumiliximab but these increases did not appear to lead to differences in eventual outcomes. An interim analysis failed to show sufficient efficacy of the combination of lumiliximab with FCR. The study was therefore stopped early for lack of efficacy.

However, high leucovorin doses may affect the cure rate in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Hitherto neither the appropriate dose of leucovorin in carriers of SLCO1B1 c.521T > C variant nor the impact of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on the risk of ALL relapse has been clarified. PROCEDURE: A double-blind and controlled study was conducted in 136 children with ALL. They were genotyped for rs4149056 single nucleotide polymorphism into wild-type group and variant group, and received MTX at 3-5 g/m(2) . Plasma concentration MTX and its metabolite were determined by HPLC. The toxicity of MTX, dose of leucovorin and 5-year relapse rate of ALL were recorded. RESULTS: Compared with wild-type group, area under the concentration time curve of MTX increased by 4.2-fold and peripheral clearance rate decreased significantly in variant group. Patients carrying rs4149056 C allele endured a remarkable longer time above the MTX safety threshold and suffered from a higher frequency of toxicity, so 2.2-fold leucovorin was given. However, no association was found between SLCO1B1 c.521T > C variant and the relapse risk in five years. CONCLUSIONS: The SLCO1B1 c.521T > C variant was an important determinant of MTX disposition and their carriers were exposed to increased intensity and time of MTX. An appropriate leucovorin dose raise in variant group was beneficial to reducing the serious toxicity. The c.521T > C variant wasn't associated with the risk of ALL relapse.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhang, Hua-Nian', 'He, Xue-Lian', 'Wang, Cheng', 'Wang, Yang', 'Chen, Yu-Jun', 'Li, Jian-Xin', 'Niu, Chang-He', 'Gao, Ping']","['Zhang HN', 'He XL', 'Wang C', 'Wang Y', 'Chen YJ', 'Li JX', 'Niu CH', 'Gao P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Organic Anion Transporters/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['SLCO1B1 polymorphism', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'leucovorin rescue', 'methotrexate', 'relapse', 'toxicity']",2014/08/19 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/08/19 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25191 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Dec;61(12):2203-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25191.

We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers. METHODS: With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects. FINDINGS: 5.24 million individuals were included; 166,955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1.62, 99% CI 1.56-1.69; p<0.0001), gallbladder (1.31, 1.12-1.52; p<0.0001), kidney (1.25, 1.17-1.33; p<0.0001), cervix (1.10, 1.03-1.17; p=0.00035), thyroid (1.09, 1.00-1.19; p=0.0088), and leukaemia (1.09, 1.05-1.13; p</=0.0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1.19, 1.12-1.27), colon (1.10, 1.07-1.13), ovarian (1.09, 1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1.05, 1.03-1.07) overall (all p<0.0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0.98, 0.95-1.00; premenopausal breast cancer 0.89, 0.86-0.92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0.96, 0.93-0.99; premenopausal breast cancer 0.89, 0.85-0.94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0.99, 0.93-1.05; oral cavity 1.07, 0.91-1.26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41% of uterine and 10% or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI. INTERPRETATION: BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

The term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is now conventionally restricted to cells with this long-term self-sustaining ability. Nevertheless, clonal tracking studies have revealed significant heterogeneity in the behavior of such stringently defined HSCs. Moreover, superimposed on the heterogeneous behavior that can be elicited from the HSCs present at any given time during development are additional differences that distinguish HSCs at different times both before and after birth. The latter include changes in the representation of HSCs that display specific differentiation programs, as well as changes in their turnover and self-renewal control.

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of ATO proliferation of osteoblast that plays very important roles in maintaining the structure integrity and function of bone. Cell survives, apoptosis, collagen, and molecular targets were identified by multiple detecting techniques, including MTT assay, electron microscopy, collagen detecting kit, TUNEL kit, and western blot in hFOB1.19 human osteoblasts cell line. The results showed that low dose of ATO (0.25, 0.5, and 1muM) remarkably enhanced the viability of cultured osteoblasts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Intriguingly, a dual effect of high dose of ATO (5, 10, and 20muM) was also observed showing significant reduction in viability of culture osteoblasts at concentration- and time-dependent fashion. Moreover, low dose of ATO promoted secretion and synthesis of collagen, whereas high dose of ATO induced typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis in osteoblasts. Mechanically, western blot results demonstrated that low dose of ATO dramatically up-regulated TGF-beta1 protein and activated p-AKT proliferative signaling. And, high dose of ATO increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in a time-dependent fashion and activated caspase-3 apoptotic signaling.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are currently studied for pDC stimulation in various clinical settings. Their efficacy depends on pDC number and functionality, which are unknown after CBT. We performed a longitudinal study of pDC reconstitution in children who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and single-unit CBT. Both CBT and unrelated BMT patients received antithymocyte globulin as part of their graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimen. pDC blood counts were higher in CBT patients than in healthy volunteers from 2 to 9 months after transplantation, whereas they remained lower in BMT patients. We showed that cord blood progenitors gave rise in vitro to a 500-fold increase in functional pDCs over bone marrow counterparts. Upon stimulation with a TLR agonist, pDCs from both CBT and BMT recipients upregulated T cell costimulatory molecules, whereas interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) production was impaired for 9 months after CBT. TLR agonist treatment is thus not expected to induce IFN-alpha production by pDCs after CBT, limiting its immunotherapeutic potential. Fortunately, in vitro production of large amounts of functional pDCs from cord blood progenitors paves the way for the post-transplantation adoptive transfer of pDCs.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Emphasis is focussed on the Febrile Infections and Melanoma (FEBIM) study on melanoma and on malignancies that seem to be related to an overexpression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K). DISCUSSION: It is claimed that, as a result of recent observational studies, measures for prevention of some malignancies such as melanoma and certain forms of leukaemia are already at hand: vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) of new-borns and vaccination with the yellow fever 17D (YFV) vaccine of adults. While the evidence of their benefit for prevention of malignancies requires substantiation, the observations that vaccinations with BCG and/or vaccinia early in life improved the outcome of patients after surgical therapy of melanoma are of practical relevance as the survival advantage conferred by prior vaccination is greater than any contemporary adjuvant therapy. SUMMARY: The reviewed findings open a debate as to whether controlled vaccination studies should be conducted in patients and/or regions for whom/where they are needed most urgently. A study proposal is made and discussed. If protection is confirmed, the development of novel recombinant vaccines with wider ranges of protection based, most likely, on BCG, YFV or vaccinia, could be attempted.",,"['Krone, Bernd', 'Kolmel, Klaus F', 'Grange, John M']","['Krone B', 'Kolmel KF', 'Grange JM']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Portrait', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,['0 (Vaccines)'],IM,"['History, 21st Century', 'History, Medieval', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Vaccination/*history', 'Vaccines/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/08/17 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/08/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-595 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-595 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Aug 16;14:595. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-595.,14,10.1186/1471-2407-14-595 [doi],"['Institute of Virology of Georg August University Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.

The translocation t(6;9) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), which fuses DEK with NUP214, confers a poor prognosis and a higher risk of relapse. The over-expression of DEK in AML has been reported, but different studies have shown diminished levels in pediatric and promyelocytic leukemias. This study has characterized DEK expression, in silico, using a large multi-center cohort of leukemic and normal control cases. Overall, DEK was under-expressed in AML compared to normal bone marrow (NBM). Studying specific subtypes of AML confirmed either no significant change or a significant reduction in DEK expression compared to NBM. Importantly, the similarity of DEK expression between AML and NBM was confirmed using immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue mircorarrays. In addition, stratification of AML patients based on median DEK expression levels indicated that DEK showed no effect on the overall survival of patients. DEK expression during normal hematopoiesis did reveal a relationship with specific cell types implicating a distinct function during myeloid differentiation.

Proliferation occurs in lymphoid tissues upon interaction of leukemic cells with a supportive microenvironment. Therefore, the mobilization of tissue-resident CLL cells into the circulation is a useful therapeutic strategy to minimize the reservoir of tumor cells within survival niches. Because the exit of normal lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues depends on the presence of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and the regulated expression of S1P receptor-1 (S1PR1), we investigated whether the expression and function of S1PR1 can be modulated by key microenvironment signals. We found that activation of CLL cells with CXCL12, fibroblast CD40L(+), BCR cross-linking, or autologous nurse-like cells reduces their S1PR1 expression and the migratory response toward S1P. Moreover, we found that S1PR1 expression was reduced in the proliferative/activated subset of leukemic cells compared with the quiescent subset from the same patient. Similarly, bone marrow-resident CLL cells expressing high levels of the activation marker CD38 showed a lower expression of S1PR1 compared with CD38(low) counterparts. Finally, given that treatment with BCR-associated kinase inhibitors induces a transient redistribution of leukemic cells from lymphoid tissues to circulation, we studied the effect of the Syk inhibitors piceatannol and R406 on S1PR1 expression and function. We found that they enhance S1PR1 expression in CLL cells and their migratory response toward S1P. Based on our results, we suggest that the regulated expression of S1PR1 might modulate the egress of the leukemic clone from lymphoid tissues.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Borge, Mercedes', 'Remes Lenicov, Federico', 'Nannini, Paula R', 'de los Rios Alicandu, Maria M', 'Podaza, Enrique', 'Ceballos, Ana', 'Fernandez Grecco, Horacio', 'Cabrejo, Maria', 'Bezares, Raimundo F', 'Morande, Pablo E', 'Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Giordano, Mirta', 'Gamberale, Romina']","['Borge M', 'Remes Lenicov F', 'Nannini PR', 'de los Rios Alicandu MM', 'Podaza E', 'Ceballos A', 'Fernandez Grecco H', 'Cabrejo M', 'Bezares RF', 'Morande PE', 'Oppezzo P', 'Giordano M', 'Gamberale R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0', '(N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-pyrid(1,4)oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyph', 'enyl)-2,4-pyrimidinediamine)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (S1PR1 protein, human)', '0 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lysophospholipids/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/biosynthesis', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2014/08/17 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/17 06:00'],"['2014/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1400547 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1400547 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Sep 15;193(6):3165-74. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1400547.

Here, we found that high expression of c-Myc was one of the cytogenetic characteristics in the drug-resistant leukemic cells. c-Myc over-expression in leukemic cells induced resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, enhanced colony formation capacity and inhibited cell differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Meanwhile, inhibition of c-Myc by shRNA or specific c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 rescued the sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, restrained the colony formation ability and promoted differentiation. RT-PCR and western blotting analysis showed that down-regulation of C/EBPbeta contributed to the poor differentiation state of leukemic cells induced by c-Myc over-expression. Importantly, over-expression of C/EBPbeta could reverse c-Myc induced drug resistance. In primary AML cells, the c-Myc expression was negatively correlated with C/EBPbeta. 10058-F4, displayed anti-proliferative activity and increased cellular differentiation with up-regulation of C/EBPbeta in primary AML cells.

The majority are of non-familial etiology and hence environmental factors and lifestyle play key roles in their pathogenesis. The extensive use of and ever increasing worldwide demand for electricity has stimulated societal and scientific interest on the environmental exposure to low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on human health. Epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between 50/60-Hz power transmission fields and leukemia or lymphoma development. Consequent to the association between EMFs and induction of oxidative stress, concerns relating to development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), have been voiced as the brain consumes the greatest fraction of oxygen and is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF)-EMFs are reported to alter animal behavior and modulate biological variables, including gene expression, regulation of cell survival, promotion of cellular differentiation, and changes in cerebral blood flow in aged AD transgenic mice. Alterations in inflammatory responses have also been reported, but how these actions impact human health remains unknown. We hence evaluated the effects of an electromagnetic wave (magnetic field intensity 1 mT; frequency, 50-Hz) on a well-characterized immortalized neuronal cell model, human SH-SY5Y cells. ELF-EMF exposure elevated the expession of NOS and O2(-), which were countered by compensatory changes in antioxidant catylase (CAT) activity and enzymatic kinetic parameters related to CYP-450 and CAT activity.

We have previously found that MIR125B1 is highly expressed in patients with APL and may be associated with disease pathogenesis; however, the mechanism by which MIR125B1 exerts its oncogenic potential has not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that MIR125B1 abundance correlates with the PML-RARA status. MIR125B1 overexpression enhanced PML-RARA expression and inhibited the ATRA-induced degradation of the PML-RARA oncoprotein. RNA-seq analysis revealed a direct link between the PML-RARA degradation pathway and MIR125B1-arrested differentiation. We further demonstrated that the MIR125B1-mediated blockade of PML-RARA proteolysis was regulated via an autophagy-lysosomal pathway, contributing to the inhibition of APL differentiation. Furthermore, we identified DRAM2 (DNA-damage regulated autophagy modulator 2), a critical regulator of autophagy, as a novel target that was at least partly responsible for the function of MIR125B1 involved in autophagy. Importantly, the knockdown phenotypes for DRAM2 are similar to the effects of overexpressing MIR125B1 as impairment of PML-RARA degradation, inhibition of autophagy, and myeloid cell differentiation arrest. These effects of MIR125B1 and its target DRAM2 were further confirmed in an APL mouse model.

Although these mechanisms have been widely investigated, little is known about membrane barriers responsible for the chemical imperviousness of cell compartments and cellular segregation in cytostatic-treated tumors. In highly heterogeneous cross-resistant and radiorefractory cell populations selected by exposure to anticancer agents, we found a number of atypical recurrent cell types in (1) tumor cell cultures of different embryonic origins, (2) mouse xenografts, and (3) paraffin sections from patient tumors. Alongside morphologic peculiarities, these populations presented cancer stem cell markers, aberrant signaling pathways, and a set of deregulated miRNAs known to confer both stem-cell phenotypes and highly aggressive tumor behavior. The first type, named spiral cells, is marked by a spiral arrangement of nuclei. The second type, monastery cells, is characterized by prominent walls inside which daughter cells can be seen maturing amid a rich mitochondrial environment. The third type, called pregnant cells, is a giant cell with a syncytium-like morphology, a main nucleus, and many endoreplicative functional progeny cells. A rare fourth cell type identified in leukemia was christened shepherd cells, as it was always associated with clusters of smaller cells. Furthermore, a portion of resistant tumor cells displayed nuclear encapsulation via mitochondrial aggregation in the nuclear perimeter in response to cytostatic insults, probably conferring imperviousness to drugs and long periods of dormancy until nuclear eclosion takes place. This phenomenon was correlated with an increase in both intracellular and intercellular mitochondrial traffic as well as with the uptake of free extracellular mitochondria. All these cellular disorders could, in fact, be found in untreated tumor cells but were more pronounced in resistant entities, suggesting a natural mechanism of cell survival triggered by chemical injury, or a primitive strategy to ensure stemming, self-renewal, and differentiation under adverse conditions, a fact that may play a significant role in chemotherapy outcomes.",,"['Diaz-Carballo, David', 'Gustmann, Sebastian', 'Jastrow, Holger', 'Acikelli, Ali Haydar', 'Dammann, Philip', 'Klein, Jacqueline', 'Dembinski, Ulrike', 'Bardenheuer, Walter', 'Malak, Sascha', 'Arauzo-Bravo, Marcos J', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Aldinger, Constanze', 'Strumberg, Dirk']","['Diaz-Carballo D', 'Gustmann S', 'Jastrow H', 'Acikelli AH', 'Dammann P', 'Klein J', 'Dembinski U', 'Bardenheuer W', 'Malak S', 'Arauzo-Bravo MJ', 'Schultheis B', 'Aldinger C', 'Strumberg D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytostatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/08/16 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/08/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2014.2375 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2014 Nov;33(11):749-74. doi: 10.1089/dna.2014.2375.

Their use in high-risk situations such as acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and stem cell transplantation is also indicated. OBJECTIVE: This audit assessed the use of G-CSF within the Oncology and Haematology Service Delivery Unit at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital (London, United Kingdom). METHODS: Patients who received G-CSF in April-May 2008 were identified retrospectively from the pharmacy labelling system, and chemotherapy front sheets, clinic letters and transplantation protocols were reviewed. Patients on lenograstim, in clinical trials or under non-approved chemotherapy protocols were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 104 G-CSF treatments were assessed. The most commonly treated malignancy was breast cancer (41.3%), with docetaxel 100 mg/m (2) (34.6%) being the most frequent chemotherapy regimen. The chemotherapy intent was curative in 66.3 % of cases. Pegfilgrastim was used in 73.1 % of cases and primary prophylaxis was the most common indication (54.8%). Stem cell transplantation was the first indication to meet the audit criterion (93.3%), followed by primary prophylaxis (89.5%). There was a considerable nonadherence for secondary prophylaxis (6.7%). CONCLUSION: The overall level of compliance with the audit criteria was 72.1%. The results for primary and secondary prophylaxis would have been different if FEC100 (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) and docetaxel 100 mg/m (2) had been considered a single chemotherapy regimen.

However, the molecule(s) that physically govern this deregulation are mostly unknown. Here, we identified RXR as an interacting partner of astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1)/metadherin (MTDH), an oncogene upregulated in all cancers. Upon interaction, AEG-1 profoundly inhibited RXR/retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcriptional activation. Consequently, AEG-1 markedly protected HCC and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells from retinoid- and rexinoid-induced cell death. In nontumorigenic cells and primary hepatocytes, AEG-1/RXR colocalizes in the nucleus in which AEG-1 interferes with recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to RXR, preventing transcription of target genes. In tumor cells and AEG-1 transgenic hepatocytes, overexpressed AEG-1 entraps RXR in cytoplasm, precluding its nuclear translocation. In addition, ERK, activated by AEG-1, phosphorylates RXR that leads to its functional inactivation and attenuation of ligand-dependent transactivation. In nude mice models, combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and AEG-1 knockdown synergistically inhibited growth of human HCC xenografts. The present study establishes AEG-1 as a novel homeostatic regulator of RXR and RXR/RAR that might contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis.

Patients are older, typically having marked lymphocytosis and splenomegaly in the absence of lymphadenopathy. It is defined as a mature B-cell leukemia with more than 55% circulating prolymphocytes. Leukemic mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in prolymphocytic transformation must be excluded. METHODS: Case archives were retrospectively reviewed for B-PLL in patients without a previous diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other B-cell neoplasm. RESULTS: We identified six cases of B-PLL with available cytogenetic data, five of which showed evidence of aberrations in MYC. Three cases showed additional signals for the MYC gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and two cases demonstrated t(8;14)MYC/IGH by karyotyping or FISH. High levels of MYC protein expression were detected in all cases tested with MYC aberrations. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that deregulation of MYC plays an important role in the pathogenesis of B-PLL and expands the spectrum of B-cell neoplasms associated with aberrations of MYC.",['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],"['Flatley, Ellen', 'Chen, Andy I', 'Zhao, Xiangrong', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Dunlap, Jennifer B', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Abdullah, Shahed', 'Olson, Susan B', 'Spurgeon, Stephen E', 'Fan, Guang']","['Flatley E', 'Chen AI', 'Zhao X', 'Jaffe ES', 'Dunlap JB', 'Pittaluga S', 'Abdullah S', 'Olson SB', 'Spurgeon SE', 'Fan G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetics', 'FISH', 'Leukemia', 'MYC', 'Prolymphocytic leukemia']",2014/08/16 06:00,2014/10/18 06:00,['2014/08/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['142/3/347 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPUBHM8U7ZFLOB [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2014 Sep;142(3):347-54. doi: 10.1309/AJCPUBHM8U7ZFLOB.,142,10.1309/AJCPUBHM8U7ZFLOB [doi],"['From the Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland;', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland;', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland;', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Knight Diagnostic Laboratory, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland;', 'From the Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland; fang@ohsu.edu.']",,,,,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This study compares neurocognitive function and brain morphology in long-term adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with chemotherapy alone (n = 36) to those treated with cranial radiation therapy (n = 39) and to healthy control subjects (n = 23). Mean (standard deviation) age at evaluation was 24.9 (3.6) years for the chemotherapy group and 26.7 (3.4) years for the cranial radiation therapy group, while time since diagnosis was 15.0 (1.7) and 23.9 (3.1) years, respectively. Brain grey and white matter volume and diffusion tensor imaging was compared between survivor groups and to 23 healthy controls with a mean (standard deviation) age of 23.1 (2.6) years. Survivors treated with chemotherapy alone had higher fractional anisotropy in fibre tracts within the left (P < 0.05), but not in the right, hemisphere when compared to controls. Survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, regardless of treatment, had a lower ratio of white matter to intracranial volume in frontal and temporal lobes (P < 0.05) compared with control subjects. Survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with chemotherapy alone performed worse in processing speed (P < 0.001), verbal selective reminding (P = 0.01), and academics (P < 0.05) compared to population norms and performed better than survivors treated with cranial radiation therapy on verbal selective reminding (P = 0.02), processing speed (P = 0.05) and memory span (P = 0.009). There were significant associations between neurocognitive performance and brain imaging, particularly for frontal and temporal white and grey matter volume. Survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with chemotherapy alone demonstrated significant long-term differences in neurocognitive function and altered neuroanatomical integrity. These results suggest substantial region-specific white matter alterations in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia possibly resulting in restricted radial diffusion due to the compaction of neuronal fibres.","['(c) The Author (2014).

We aim to test antiapoptosis effects of ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide under cholestatic induction by glycochenodeoxycholic acid treatment of mouse hepatocytes and hypoxia induction by cobalt chloride treatment of intrahepatic biliary epithelial cancer Mz-ChA-1cell line. Such treatments caused marked increases in apoptosis as evidenced by activation of caspase 3, caspase 8 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Co-treatment with ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide significantly inhibited these increases. Interestingly, ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide was able to increase expression of antiapoptotic cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein in both cell types. Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide also prevented the decreases of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 protein in both experimental systems, and this protection was due to ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide's ability to inhibit ubiquitination-mediated degradation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1, and to increase the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta. In addition, ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide was able to prevent the decreased expression of another antiapoptotic cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 in cobalt chloride-treated Mz-ChA-1 cells. Hence, ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide mediated cytoprotection against apoptosis during toxic bile-acid and ischemic stresses by a mechanism involving accumulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 proteins. Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide may thus be used as an agent to prevent hepatic ischemia reperfusion.",['(c) 2014 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.'],"['Sellinger, Myra', 'Xu, Weihong', 'Pathil, Anita', 'Stremmel, Wolfgang', 'Chamulitrat, Walee']","['Sellinger M', 'Xu W', 'Pathil A', 'Stremmel W', 'Chamulitrat W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '39382-08-6 (phosphatidylethanolamine)', '640-79-9 (Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid)', '724L30Y2QR (Ursodeoxycholic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholestasis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', '*Liver/blood supply/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bile acid toxicity', 'antiapoptosis proteins', 'cytoprotective drug', 'hypoxia', 'proteasome-mediated degradation']",2014/08/16 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/08/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1535370214547157 [pii]', '10.1177/1535370214547157 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2015 Feb;240(2):252-60. doi: 10.1177/1535370214547157.

However, the roles of lncRNA associated-ceRNAs in oncogenesis are not fully understood. Here, based on lncRNA microarray data of gastric cancer, bioinformatic algorithm miRcode and microRNA (miRNA) targets database TarBase, we first constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Then, we confirmed it by data of six types of other cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary gonadotrope tumors, ovarian cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results showed a clear cancer-associated ceRNA network. Eight lncRNAs (AC009499.1, GACAT1, GACAT3, H19, LINC00152, AP000288.2, FER1L4, and RP4-620F22.3) and nine miRNAs (miR-18a-5p, miR-18b-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-20b-5p, miR-106a-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-139-5p, and miR-195-5p) were involved. For instance, through its miRNA response elements (MREs) to compete for miR-106a-5p, lncRNA-FER1L4 regulates the expression of PTEN, RB1, RUNX1, VEGFA, CDKN1A, E2F1, HIPK3, IL-10, and PAK7.

Mutations in these genes are found in numerous tumor types including paragangliomas, kidney cancers, leiomyomas, glioblastomas and acute myeloid leukemia.

Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to assess the associations. Both SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 showed significant associations with childhood ALL risk in all genetic models after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, subtype analyses of B-lineage ALL provided strong evidence that SNP rs10994982 is highly associated with the risk of developing B-hyperdiploid ALL. These results indicate that SNPs rs10994982 and rs7089424 are indeed significantly associated with increased risk of childhood ALL.",,"['Zeng, Hui', 'Wang, Xue-Bin', 'Cui, Ning-Hua', 'Nam, Seungyoon', 'Zeng, Tuo', 'Long, Xinghua']","['Zeng H', 'Wang XB', 'Cui NH', 'Nam S', 'Zeng T', 'Long X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,,2014/08/16 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2014/08/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.15.6211 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(15):6211-7. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.15.6211.,15,,"['Center for Gene Diagnosis, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China E-mail : xlong888@yahoo.com.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS: DIAGNOSIS is based on bone marrow morphology. The presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation is supportive but not essential for diagnosis; approximately 90% of patients carry one of these mutations and 10% are ""triple-negative."" None of these mutations are specific to PMF and are also seen in essential thrombocythemia (ET). Prefibrotic PMF mimics ET in its presentation and the distinction, enabled by careful bone marrow morphological examination, is prognostically relevant. Differential diagnosis also includes chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. RISK STRATIFICATION: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus (DIPSS-plus) uses eight predictors of inferior survival: age >65 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, leukocytes >25 x 10(9) /L, circulating blasts >/=1%, constitutional symptoms, red cell transfusion dependency, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L, and unfavorable karyotype (i.e., complex karyotype or sole or two abnormalities that include +8, -7/7q-, i(17q), inv(3), -5/5q-, 12p-, or 11q23 rearrangement). The presence of 0, 1, ""2 or 3,"" and >/=4 adverse factors defines low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk disease with median survivals of approximately 15.4, 6.5, 2.9, and 1.3 years, respectively. High risk disease is also defined by CALR(-) /ASXL1(+) mutational status. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Observation alone is adequate for asymptomatic low/intermediate-1 risk disease, especially with CALR(+) /ASXL1(-) mutational status. Stem cell transplant is considered for DIPSS-plus high risk disease or any risk disease with CALR(-) /ASXL1(+) mutational status. Investigational drug therapy is reasonable for symptomatic intermediate-1 or intermediate-2 risk disease. Splenectomy is considered for drug-refractory splenomegaly. Involved field radiotherapy is most useful for post-splenectomy hepatomegaly, non-hepatosplenic EMH, PMF-associated pulmonary hypertension, and extremity bone pain.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tefferi, Ayalew']",['Tefferi A'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'World Health Organization']",,,2014/08/16 06:00,2014/10/04 06:00,['2014/08/16 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23703 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Sep;89(9):915-25. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23703.,89,10.1002/ajh.23703 [doi],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most prevalent age range at time of RT was 10-15 years, and the most common diagnoses were central nervous system tumours (34%) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (20%). CONCLUSIONS: The Registry provides a reflection of the patterns of care of children undergoing RT in Australia and a mechanism for determining the resources necessary to manage children by RT (human, facilities and emerging technologies, such as proton therapy). It lacks the detail to provide information on radiotherapy quality and disease outcomes which should be the subject of separate audit studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibition of cell proliferation and its mechanism were assessed through a cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot. The in vivo efficacy of escin in CRPC cells was assessed using a xenograft tumor model subcutaneously established in BALB/c nude mice. RESULTS: The treatment with escin significantly reduced cell viability of CRPC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Escin induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, which was accompanied by increases in pro-apoptotic (BCL-2 associated X protein, cleaved-caspase3, and cleaved-poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase) proteins and decreases in antiapoptotic (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2, and B-cell lymphoma-extra large) proteins. Escin induced G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and thus led to a significant decrease in the expression of cyclinB1 and its activating partner cyclin-dependent kinase 1, with the concomitant induction of p21.

Genetic studies have mapped several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with GD, but the mechanisms by which they trigger disease are unknown. We hypothesized that epigenetic modifications induced by microenvironmental influences of cytokines can reveal the functionality of GD-associated SNPs. We analyzed genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 methylation and gene expression in thyroid cells induced by IFNalpha, a key cytokine secreted during viral infections, and overlapped them with known GD-associated SNPs. We mapped an open chromatin region overlapping two adjacent GD-associated SNPs (rs12101255 and rs12101261) in intron 1 of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) gene. We then demonstrated that this region functions as a regulatory element through binding of the transcriptional repressor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) at the rs12101261 site.

However, very little is known about its role in multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated the potential of targeting sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) for the treatment of MM. We found that SK2 was overexpressed in MM cell lines and in primary human bone marrow (BM) CD1381 myeloma cells. Inhibition of SK2 by SK2- specific short hairpin RNA or ABC294640 (a SK2 specific inhibitor) effectively inhibited myeloma cell proliferation and induced caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. ABC294640 inhibited primary human CD1381 myeloma cells with the same efficacy as with MM cell lines. ABC294640 effectively induced apoptosis of myeloma cells, even in the presence of BM stromal cells. Furthermore, we found that ABC294640 downregulated the expression of pS6 and directed c-Myc and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) for proteasome degradation. In addition, ABC294640 increased Noxa gene transcription and protein expression. ABC294640, per se, did not affect the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), but acted synergistically with ABT-737 (a Bcl-2 inhibitor) in inducing myeloma cell death.

Recently, CD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells from naive mice (nCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells) have shown superior anti-tumor properties in melanoma-bearing mice. Considering that antigen-specific memory T cells have shown to possess more potent immunity than non-specific memory T cells, we hypothesized that CD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells from tumor-bearing individuals (mCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells) might have superior anti-tumor effect than nCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells. Therefore, we investigated phenotypes, functions and the in vivo distribution of mCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells in tumor-bearing mice. We found that, while keeping the features of central memory T cells, the frequency of mCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cell in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice was significantly higher than that the one of nCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cell in naive mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that mCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells had higher proliferation rate and IFN-gamma production than nCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells, in vitro. We performed adoptive transfer of mCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells into melanoma-bearing mice and tracked them in spleen, lymph nodes and in melanoma tissues. Our results show that mCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells had stronger in vivo anti-tumoral activity than nCD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells.

We describe here an approach based on a large-scale intracellular expression and selection of antibody fragments in eukaryotic cells, so-called intrabodies, and the subsequent identification of their natural target within living cell. Starting from a phenotypic trait, this integrated system allows the identification of new therapeutic targets together with their companion inhibitory intrabody. We applied this system in a model of allergy and inflammation. We first cloned a large and highly diverse intrabody library both in a plasmid and a retroviral eukaryotic expression vector. After transfection in the RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cell line, we performed seven rounds of selection to isolate cells displaying a defect in FcepsilonRI-induced degranulation. We used high throughput sequencing to identify intrabody sequences enriched during the course of selection. Only one intrabody was common to both plasmid and retroviral selections, and was used to capture and identify its target from cell extracts. Mass spectrometry analysis identified protein RGD1311164 (C12orf4), with no previously described function. Our data demonstrate that RGD1311164 is a cytoplasmic protein implicated in the early signaling events following FcepsilonRI-induced cell activation.

Paclitaxel is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, whose mechanism of action is related to its ability to arrest cells in mitosis and the subsequent induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. By using two prostate cancer cell lines with different responses to paclitaxel treatment, we have identified two situations in which PTTG1 influences cell fate differentially. In slippage-prone PC3 cells, both PTTG1 downregulation and overexpression induce an increase in mitotic cells that is associated with diminished apoptosis after paclitaxel treatment. In LNCaP cells, however, PTTG1 downregulation prevents mitotic entry and, subsequently, inhibits mitosis-associated, paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In contrast, PTTG1 overexpression induces an increase in mitotic cells and apoptosis after paclitaxel treatment. We have also identified a role for Mcl-1 protein in preventing apoptosis during mitosis in PC3 cells, as simultaneous PTTG1 and Mcl-1 silencing enhances mitosis-associated apoptosis after paclitaxel treatment. The finding that a more efficient mitotic arrest alone in PC3 cells is not enough to increase apoptosis was also confirmed with the observation that a selected paclitaxel-resistant PC3 cell line showed an apoptosis-resistant phenotype associated with increased mitosis upon paclitaxel treatment.

This national hospital-based case-control study was carried out in Brazil among children aged 0-23 months who were recruited at cancer and general hospitals in 13 states. Maternal medicine intake during pregnancy, including analgesic intake, was assessed by face-to-face interviews with the mothers of 231 leukemia patients and 411 controls. Unconditional logistic regression was used to ascertain crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between maternal analgesic use during pregnancy and early age leukemia. Acetaminophen use during the first trimester of pregnancy showed an OR=0.39 (95% CI 0.17-0.93) for acute lymphocytic leukemia and an OR=0.37 (95% CI 0.16-0.88) for use in the second trimester. For acute myeloid leukemia, an OR=0.11 (95% CI 0.02-0.97) was found following acetaminophen use in the second trimester. For acute lymphocytic leukemia, the exclusive use of dipyrone during preconception showed an OR=1.63 (95% CI 1.06-2.53) and dipyrone intake during lactation showed an OR=2.00 (95% CI 1.18-3.39).

EBV is associated with several types of malignancies originating from lymphoid and epithelial cell types. EBV latent antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is essential for EBV-induced immortalization of B-cells. The Moloney murine leukemia provirus integration site (PIM-1), which encodes an oncogenic serine/threonine kinase, is linked to several cellular functions involving cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Notably, enhanced expression of Pim-1 kinase is associated with numerous hematological and non-hematological malignancies. A higher expression level of Pim-1 kinase is associated with EBV infection, suggesting a crucial role for Pim-1 in EBV-induced tumorigenesis. We now demonstrate a molecular mechanism which reveals a direct role for EBNA3C in enhancing Pim-1 expression in EBV-infected primary B-cells. We also showed that EBNA3C is physically associated with Pim-1 through its amino-terminal domain, and also forms a molecular complex in B-cells. EBNA3C can stabilize Pim-1 through abrogation of the proteasome/Ubiquitin pathway. Our results demonstrate that EBNA3C enhances Pim-1 mediated phosphorylation of p21 at the Thr145 residue. EBNA3C also facilitated the nuclear localization of Pim-1, and promoted EBV transformed cell proliferation by altering Pim-1 mediated regulation of the activity of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21/WAF1. Our study demonstrated that EBNA3C significantly induces Pim-1 mediated proteosomal degradation of p21. A significant reduction in cell proliferation of EBV-transformed LCLs was observed upon stable knockdown of Pim-1. This study describes a critical role for the oncoprotein Pim-1 in EBV-mediated oncogenesis, as well as provides novel insights into oncogenic kinase-targeted therapeutic intervention of EBV-associated cancers.",,"['Banerjee, Shuvomoy', 'Lu, Jie', 'Cai, Qiliang', 'Sun, Zhiguo', 'Jha, Hem Chandra', 'Robertson, Erle S']","['Banerjee S', 'Lu J', 'Cai Q', 'Sun Z', 'Jha HC', 'Robertson ES']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (EBNA-3C, epstein-barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",,,2014/08/15 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/08/15 06:00'],"['2014/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004304 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-00421 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Aug 14;10(8):e1004304. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004304. eCollection 2014 Aug.,10,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004304 [doi],"['Department of Microbiology and the Tumor Virology Program, Abramson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and the Tumor Virology Program, Abramson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', ""Key Laboratory of Molecular Medical Virology (Ministries of Education and Health), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Microbiology and the Tumor Virology Program, Abramson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and the Tumor Virology Program, Abramson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and the Tumor Virology Program, Abramson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",PMC4133388,,20140814,,,,,"['R01 CA137894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5-R01-CA-137894-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is challenging sometimes to distinguish HCL from its mimics. Recently, the BRAF V600E mutation has been described as a disease-defining molecular marker for HCL which is present in nearly all cases of HCL but virtually absent in mimics of HCL. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using immunohistochemical detection of the BRAF V600E mutant protein to differentiate HCL from its mimics. A total of twenty-eight FFPE tissue specimens were studied, including HCL (n=12), HCL variant (HCL-v, n=3), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL, n=6), and other marginal zone lymphomas (MZL, n=7). Immunohistochemical studies were performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone VE1, Spring Bioscience, CA) specific for BRAF V600E mutation. Molecularly confirmed BRAF V600E mutation positive and negative cases were used as the positive and negative controls respectively. All 12 cases of HCL showed cytoplasmic BRAF V600E protein expression in leukemia cells by immunohistochemical study regardless of tumor burden, whereas all cases of HCL mimics including HCL-v, SMZL, and MZL were negative for BRAF V600E protein.

Although it has been found that activation of Notch1 signaling occurs in >50% T-ALL patients, gamma-secretase inhibitors that target Notch1 signaling are of limited efficacy. However, c-Myc is an important direct target of Notch1 and, thus, c-Myc is another potential therapeutic target for T-ALL. Valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has been reported to treat various hematological malignancies. In the present study, we showed that c-Myc expression, at a transcriptional level, was dose-dependently downregulated in VPA-induced growth inhibition in T-ALL cell lines, Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells. 10058-F4, a small molecule c-Myc inhibitor, could increase the downregulation of c-Myc and markedly increase the growth inhibition and cell death induced by VPA in Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells, which was accompanied by obvious cleavage of capase-3. Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, partially prevented the anti-leukemic effect.

ATF5 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is highly expressed in malignant glioma and is essential for glioma cell survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that human malignant gliomas are universally infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Recent studies have shown that HCMV may be resistant to the induction of apoptosis by disrupting cellular pathways in glioblastoma. To investigate the potential anti-apoptotic function of HCMV in glioma, malignant U87 glioma cells were infected with HCMV. The present study showed that HCMV infection suppressed apoptosis in glioblastoma U87 cells by regulating the expression of ATF5. Furthermore, in glioblastoma U87 cells, HCMV infection induced cellular proliferation in parallel with an increase in the expression level of ATF5 and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 to Bcl-2-associated X protein ratio. Loss of ATF5 function was achieved using a dominant-negative form of ATF5 in U87 cells, whereby cells appeared to grow marginally following HCMV infection when compared with the control. However, the anti-apoptotic ability was appeared to decline in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. These results indicate that ATF5 signaling pathways may be important in the anti-apoptotic activity of HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells; therefore, the anti-apoptotic molecular mechanisms of HCMV in human glioblastoma cells were investigated in the current study.

The genetic features and clinical implications of five NUP214-associated fusion genes are described in this review. SET-NUP214 was most frequently observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), concomitant with the elevated expression of HOXA cluster genes. Furthermore, the fusion transcript may be regarded as a potential minimal residual disease marker for SET-NUP214-positive patients. Episomal amplifications of NUP214-ABL1 are specific to T-ALL patients. The NUP214-ABL1 gene is observed in ~6% of T-ALL, in children and adults.

Achieving molecular negativity of DEK-NUP214 is of great importance for individual management. SQSTM1-NUP214 and NUP214-XKR3 were only identified in one T-ALL patient and one cell line, respectively. The NUP214 fusions have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications for leukemia patients.

By flow cytometry both MCL and B-CLL are CD19, CD20 and usually CD5 positive. However, ambiguities in other immune phenotypic markers of these lymphoma entities sometimes complicate the flow cytometric differential diagnosis. We here demonstrate that the transcription factor SOX11, which is highly up-regulated in most MCL, can be analyzed by flow cytometry. SOX11 protein could be consistently detected in ex vivo isolated MCL but not in B-CLL/SLL. Flow cytometry also enabled protein quantification, and SOX11 protein levels correlated with mRNA expression.

METHODS: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the p53 gene deletion in 77 patients with CLL. Presence of the deletion and its association with clinical and laboratory features as well as prognostic factors were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survivals, and the results were compared using a Log-rank test. RESULTS: p53 gene deletion was found in 10 (12.9%) of the patients but none from the control group (P<0.05). The deletion was found in 12.5% (4/32) of ethnic Hans and 13.3% (6/45) of ethnic Uyghurs (P>0.05). No significant different distribution of p53 gene deletion was found in regard to sex, age, ethnicity, peripheral blood cell count (except for Hb) or the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, beta2-micro globulin and CD38 (P>0.05). The deletion rate was higher in the group with high expression of ZAP-70 and patients with advanced stage disease than that in the group of low expression and early-stage CLL (P<0.05). Among 20 patients who received fludarabine therapy, the overall remission rate for those with p53 gene deletion (20%) was lower than those without (75%) (P<0.05). With a median follow-up time of 39.0 (8.0-136.0) months, 11 cases had died (14.3%), among them, 7 cases died from CLL and related complications, and all of them were founded p53 gene deletion.

In this review, we have generated a unifying model of the action of Nm23-H1 in AML, including previously unpublished data from our laboratory, and provide arguments as to why we consider this role to be distinct from that in ES and IPS cells.",,"['Lilly, A Joshua', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Bunce, Christopher M']","['Lilly AJ', 'Khanim FL', 'Bunce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mucin-1/metabolism', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism']",,,2014/08/15 06:00,2015/10/03 06:00,['2014/08/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00210-014-1027-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2015 Feb;388(2):225-33. doi: 10.1007/s00210-014-1027-8.

Disturbing the equilibrium between Met and its ligand may lead to inappropriate cell survival, accumulation of genetic abnormalities and eventually, malignancy. Abnormal activation of the HGF/Met axis is established in solid tumours and in chronic haematological malignancies, including myeloma, acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for the abnormal activation of HGF/Met pathways are described and discussed. Importantly, inCML and in MPNs, the production of HGF is independent of Bcr-Abl and JAK2V617F, the main molecular markers of these diseases. In vitro studies showed that blocking HGF/Met function with neutralizing antibodies or Met inhibitors significantly impairs the growth of JAK2V617F-mutated cells. With personalised medicine and curative treatment in view, blocking activation of HGF/Met could be a useful addition in the treatment of CML and MPNs for those patients with high HGF/MET expression not controlled by current treatments (Bcr-Abl inhibitors in CML; phlebotomy, hydroxurea, JAK inhibitors in MPNs).",,"['Boissinot, Marjorie', 'Vilaine, Mathias', 'Hermouet, Sylvie']","['Boissinot M', 'Vilaine M', 'Hermouet S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,,,2014/08/15 06:00,2014/08/15 06:01,['2014/08/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers6031631 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers6031631 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2014 Aug 12;6(3):1631-69. doi: 10.3390/cancers6031631.,6,10.3390/cancers6031631 [doi],"[""Translational Neuro-Oncology Group, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds, Level 5 Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St James's Hospital, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK. m.boissinot@leeds.ac.uk."", 'Institute of Research on Cancer and Aging (IRCAN), CNRS-Inserm-UNS UMR 7284, U 1081, Centre A.

Here we identify the absolute requirement for myeloid cell leukaemia sequence-1 (Mcl1) in the sustained survival of NK cells in vivo. Mcl1 is highly expressed in NK cells and regulated by IL-15 in a dose-dependent manner via STAT5 phosphorylation and subsequent binding to the 3'-UTR of Mcl1. Specific deletion of Mcl1 in NK cells results in the absolute loss of NK cells from all tissues owing to a failure to antagonize pro-apoptotic proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This NK lymphopenia results in mice succumbing to multiorgan melanoma metastases, being permissive to allogeneic transplantation and being resistant to toxic shock following polymicrobial sepsis challenge.

We found that HSP90 was cleaved to 55 kDa protein after treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in several leukemia cell lines. We further analyzed molecular changes induced by SAHA in K562 cells. The SAHA-induced cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, implying that the process is dependent on caspase activity. However, the experiments using antagonistic and agonistic Fas antibodies revealed that the cleavage of HSP90 was not dependent on Fas signaling. SAHA induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a ROS scavenger N-acetylcystein (NAC). We also confirmed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced cleavage of HSP90 in a similar manner. Caspase 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were activated by treatment with SAHA, and the activities were reduced by the pretreatment of NAC. Treatment of the cells with caspase 10 inhihitor, but not other inhibitors of caspases activated by SAHA, prevented cleavage of HSP90 by SAHA. SAHA-induced ROS generation and HSP90 cleavage were dependent on newly synthesized unknown proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that the cleavage of HSP90 by SAHA is mediated by ROS generation and caspase 10 activation.

Recently, clinical and physiopathologic evidences showed that vascular endothelium can be a target of GvHD in the early phase and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) represent surrogate markers of endothelial damage. METHODS: Using the CellSearch System (Veridex LLC, Raritan, NJ), CECs were counted before (T1), after conditioning regimen (T2), at engraftment (T3), at GvHD onset (T4), and after steroid treatment (T5) in 40 patients (7 Hodgkin's Disease, 13 Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia, 5 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 8 Multiple Myeloma, 3 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, 1 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, 1 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2 Severe Aplastic Anemia) undergoing allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The median CEC per milliliter at T1 was 20 (n=33, range 4-718), in comparison to a value of 2 (range, 1-14) in controls (P<0.001). At T3, CEC per milliliter were 47 (range, 16-148) in GvHD patients and 92 (range, 23-276) in patients without GvHD (P=0.006). This difference remained significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.99; P=0.02). At GvHD onset, the relative increase of CEC counts from time of engraftment (T4 vs. T3) was 44% (range, -43% to 569%) in GvHD patients versus 0% (range, -49% to 2%) in patients without GvHD (P=0.003), being confirmed as significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.08; P=0.04).

It suppresses genes expression by recruitment of a number of transcriptional repressors, resulting in differentiation block and malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Here, we found that mice primary hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), transduced by DNA-binding-defective PML/RARA mutants, were deficient in colony formation. Further experiments showed that DNA-binding-defective PML/RARA mutants could not repress the transcription of retinoic acid regulated genes.

Some retinoic acid target genes regulated by PML/RARA are involved in not only differentiation block but also hematopoietic cell self-renewal.

Thus, the impact of PTBP3 on the differentiation and proliferation of gastric cancer cells was investigated. MAIN METHODS: PTBP3 expression was analyzed in normal and tumor tissues using immunohistochemistry. A xenograft model was established in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of untransfected human gastric cancer MKN45 cells or those expressing a control vector or PTBP3 siRNA. We analyzed the tumor inhibition rate, the expression of PTBP3, the PCNA-positive rate and the serum levels of CEA, CA199, CA125, LDH, ALP and gamma-GT in different groups. KEY FINDINGS: The tumor weights in the PTBP3 siRNA group were significantly lower than that of the MKN45 cell control group (P<0.001). Immunohistochemistry analysis of PCNA expression revealed that it was markedly reduced after PTBP3 silencing. ELISAs showed that the serum levels of CEA and CA199 tumor markers as well as LDH and ALP were reduced after PTBP3 silencing. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that MKN45 cells expressing PTBP3 siRNA had reduced nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and regular nuclei, suggesting differentiation.

CSCs are difficult to study because their population is quite low in tumor specimens. To overcome this problem, we established a culture method to induce a pancreatic cancer stem-like cell (P-CSLC)-enriched population from human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines established at our department were cultured in CSC-inducing media containing epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), neural cell survivor factor-1 (NSF-1), and N-acetylcysteine. Sphere cells were obtained and then transferred to a laminin-coated dish and cultured for approximately two months. The surface markers, gene expression, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, cell cycle, and tumorigenicity of these induced cells were examined for their stem cell-like characteristics. The population of these induced cells expanded within a few months. The ratio of CD24high, CD44high, epithelial specific antigen (ESA) high, and CD44variant (CD44v) high cells in the induced cells was greatly enriched. The induced cells stayed in the G0/G1 phase and demonstrated mesenchymal and stemness properties. The induced cells had high tumorigenic potential. Thus, we established a culture method to induce a P-CSLC-enriched population from human pancreatic cancer cell lines. The CSLC population was enriched approximately 100-fold with this method.

Molecular data showed that the isolated fraction of LTE induced apoptosis of HL-60 as characterized by DNA fragmentation; activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9; and inactivation of poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. Moreover, LTE fraction increased the ratio of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) that caused mitochondrial membrane potential loss and cytochrome c released to cytosol.

Several genetic abnormalities have been identified as critical for the development of MM; however, a number of these abnormalities are also found in patients with MGUS, indicating that there are other, as yet unidentified, factors that contribute to the onset of MM disease. In this study, we identify a Samsn1 gene deletion in the 5TGM1/C57BL/KaLwRij murine model of myeloma. In addition, SAMSN1 expression is reduced in the malignant CD138+ PCs of patients with MM and this reduced expression correlates to total PC burden. We identify promoter methylation as a potential mechanism through which SAMSN1 expression is modulated in human myeloma cell lines. Notably, re-expression of Samsn1 in the 5TGM1 murine PC line resulted in complete inhibition of MM disease development in vivo and decreased proliferation in stromal cell-PC co-cultures in vitro. This is the first study to identify deletion of a key gene in the C57BL/KaLwRij mice that also displays reduced gene expression in patients with MM and is therefore likely to play an integral role in MM disease development.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

The disease is caused by fowl glioma-inducing virus (FGV) and its variants, belonging to subgroup A of avian leukosis virus (ALV-A). Fifty-seven FGV variants have so far been isolated from Japanese fowls and these variants have a variable degree of glioma inducibility. However, how these ALVs induce glioma with different degrees and frequencies has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the relationship between intracerebral viral replication and astrocytic growth in the early infectious phase. Replication abilities of two ALV strains, Sp-53 (a FGV variant) and ALV-based replication-competent vector RCAS(A) without glioma inducibility, were compared in the brains of C/O specific pathogen free chickens at 35 days of age. Sp-53 replicated faster than RCAS(A), and the histological score and the level of interleukin (IL)-1beta in brains increased depending on the level of intracerebral viral RNA. Up-regulation of IL-1beta was also demonstrated in primary cultured astrocytes.

Previous studies have produced conflicting results, probably because of limitations assessing radon exposure, too few cancer cases and poorly documented health statistics. METHODS: We used a cohort approach of 0-15-year-old children to examine whether residential radon exposure was associated with childhood leukaemia and cancer in the central nervous system in the Oslo region. The study was based on Norwegian population registers and identified cancer cases from The Cancer Registry of Norway. The residence of every child was geo-coded and assigned a radon exposure. RESULTS: In all, 712 674 children were followed from 1967 to 2009 from birth to date of cancer diagnosis, death, emigration or 15 years of age. A total of 864 cancer cases were identified, 437 children got leukaemia and 427 got cancer in the central nervous system.Conclusions or interpretation:No association was found for childhood leukaemia.

We now extend our study to non-solid tissue tumor cells, in this case, a primitive, possible stem cell human leukemia cell line (K562) that is also p53-homozygously deleted. Our purpose was twofold: to investigate if these cells likewise express HDM-2 in their plasma membranes and to determine if our anti-cancer peptide induces tumor cell necrosis in these non-solid tissue tumor cells in a manner that depends on the interaction between the peptide and membrane-bound HDM-2. PROCEDURES: The anti-cancer activity and mechanism of PNC-27, which carries a p53 aa12-26-leader sequence connected on its carboxyl terminal end to a trans-membrane-penetrating sequence or membrane residency peptide (MRP), was studied against p53-null K562 leukemia cells. Murine leukocytes were used as a non-cancer cell control. Necrosis was determined by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and apoptosis was determined by the detection of Caspases 3 and 7. Membrane colocalization of PNC-27 with HDM-2 was analyzed microscopically using fluorescently labeled antibodies against HDM-2 and PNC-27 peptides. RESULTS: We found that K562 cells strongly express HDM-2 protein in their membranes and that PNC-27 co-localizes with this protein in the membranes of these cells. PNC-27, but not the negative control peptide PNC-29, is selectively cytotoxic to K562 cells, inducing nearly 100 percent cell killing with LDH release. In contrast, this peptide had no effect on the lymphocyte control cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that HDM-2 is expressed in the membranes of non-solid tissue tumor cells in addition to the membranes of solid tissue tumor cells. Since K-562 cells appear to be in the stem cell family, the results suggest that early developing tumor cells also express HDM-2 protein in their membranes. Since PNC-27 induces necrosis of K-562 leukemia cells and co-localizes with HDM-2 in the tumor cell membrane as an early event, we conclude that the association of PNC-27 with HDM-2 in the cancer cell membrane results in trans-membrane pore formation which results in cancer cell death, as previously discovered in a number of different solid tissue tumor cells. Since K562 cells lack p53 expression, these effects of PNC-27 on this leukemia cell line occur by a p53-independent pathway.","['(c) 2014 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Davitt, Katlin', 'Babcock, Blake D', 'Fenelus, Maly', 'Poon, Chi Kong', 'Sarkar, Abhishek', 'Trivigno, Vincent', 'Zolkind, Paul A', 'Matthew, Sheena M', ""Grin'kina, Natalia"", 'Orynbayeva, Zulfiya', 'Shaikh, Mohammad F', 'Adler, Victor', 'Michl, Josef', 'Sarafraz-Yazdi, Ehsan', 'Pincus, Matthew R', 'Bowne, Wilbur B']","['Davitt K', 'Babcock BD', 'Fenelus M', 'Poon CK', 'Sarkar A', 'Trivigno V', 'Zolkind PA', 'Matthew SM', ""Grin'kina N"", 'Orynbayeva Z', 'Shaikh MF', 'Adler V', 'Michl J', 'Sarafraz-Yazdi E', 'Pincus MR', 'Bowne WB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PNC-27)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['PNC-27', 'apoptosis', 'cancer', 'leukemia', 'necrosis', 'p53-derived peptide']",2014/08/15 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/08/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['44/3/241 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2014 Summer;44(3):241-8.,44,,"['Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Physiology, Department of Microbiology and Anatomy and Cell Biology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY Department of Microbiology and Anatomy and Cell Biology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, New York Harbor VA Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY and New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA Department of Surgery, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY wilbur.bowne@drexelmed.edu matthew.pincus2@med.va.gov.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective cohort study of cancer patients referred to a hospice research network.,505-12,"CONTEXT: Although much is known about solid tumor patients who use hospice, the hematologic malignancies hospice population is inadequately described. OBJECTIVES: To compare the characteristics and outcomes of hospice patients with hematologic malignancies to those with solid tumors. METHODS: We extracted electronic patient data (2008-2012) from a large hospice network (Coalition of Hospices Organized to Investigate Comparative Effectiveness) and used bivariate analyses to describe between-group differences. RESULTS: In total, 48,147 patients with cancer were admitted during the study period; 3518 (7.3%) had a hematologic malignancy. These patients had significantly worse Palliative Performance Scale scores (32% vs. 24% were below 40; P < 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (median 11 vs. 19 days; P < 0.001). They were more likely to die within 24 hours of hospice enrollment (10.9% vs. 6.8%; odds ratio [OR] 1.66; 95% CI 1.49, 1.86; P < 0.001) or within seven days (36% vs. 25.1%; OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.56, 1.81; P < 0.001) and were more likely to receive hospice services in an inpatient or nursing home setting (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.16, 1.56 and OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.39, 1.72; both P < 0.001). Among hematologic malignancy patients, those with leukemia had the shortest survival (hazard ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.13, 1.34; P < 0.001), and 40.3% used hospice for less than seven days (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.11, 1.56; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Hospice patients with hematologic malignancies are more seriously ill at the time of admission, with worse functional status and shorter lengths of stay than other cancer patients. Differences in outcomes suggest the need for targeted interventions to optimize hospice services for the hematologic malignancies population, especially those with leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

We show that SUSD2 expression, and hence the ratio of W5C5(+):W5C5(-) cells, changes in culture depending on cell-cell contact and activation of the Notch signaling pathway. RNA sequencing revealed that cultures derived from W5C5(+) progenitor cells remain phenotypically distinct by the enrichment of novel and established endometrial perivascular signature genes. In an undifferentiated state, W5C5(+)-derived cells produced lower levels of various chemokines and inflammatory modulators when compared with their W5C5(-) counterparts. This divergence in secretomes was switched and became more pronounced upon decidualization, which transformed perivascular W5C5(+) cells into the dominant source of a range of chemokines and cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7.

In this study we examined the effect of altered p21 expression on the sensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia cells in response to HDAC inhibitor SAHA treatment and investigated the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Stably transfected HL60 cell lines were established in RPMI-1640 with supplementation of G-418. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Western blot was applied to assess the protein expression levels of target genes. Cell apoptosis was monitored by AnnexinV-PE/7AAD assay. RESULTS: We showed HL60 cells that that didn't up-regulate p21 expression were more sensitive to SAHA-mediated apoptosis than NB4 and U937 cells that had increased p21 level. Enforced expression of p21 in HL60 cells reduced sensitivity to SAHA and blocked TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Conversely, p21 silencing in NB4 cells enhanced SAHA-mediated apoptosis and lethality. Finally, we found that combined treatment with SAHA and rapamycin down-regulated p21 and enhanced apoptosis in AML cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that up-regulated p21 expression mediates resistance to SAHA via inhibition of TRAIL apoptotic pathway. P21 may serve as a candidate biomarker to predict responsiveness or resistance to SAHA-based therapy in AML patients. In addition, rapamycin may be an effective agent to override p21-mediated resistance to SAHA in AML patients.","['(c) 2014 S.

Mutant p53 exerts an oncogenic function and is often highly expressed in cancer cells due to evasion of proteasome-dependent degradation. Thus, reactivating proteasome-dependent degradation of mutant p53 protein is an attractive strategy for cancer management. Previously, we found that arsenic trioxide (ATO), a drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, degrades mutant p53 protein through a proteasome pathway. However, it remains unclear what is the E3 ligase that targets mutant p53 for degradation. In current study, we sought to identify an E3 ligase necessary for ATO-mediated degradation of mutant p53. We found that ATO induces expression of Pirh2 E3 ligase at the transcriptional level. We also found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, ATO-induced degradation of mutant p53 protein. Furthermore, we found that Pirh2 E3 ligase physically interacts with and targets mutant p53 for polyubiquitination and subsequently proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, we found that ATO cooperates with HSP90 or HDAC inhibitor to promote mutant p53 degradation and growth suppression in tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that ATO promotes mutant p53 degradation in part via induction of the Pirh2-dependent proteasome pathway.",,"['Yan, Wensheng', 'Jung, Yong-Sam', 'Zhang, Yanhong', 'Chen, Xinbin']","['Yan W', 'Jung YS', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RCHY1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Mutant Proteins', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,,2014/08/15 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/08/14 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0103497 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-17020 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 12;9(8):e103497. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0103497. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0103497 [doi],"['Comparative Oncology Laboratory, School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of California at Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Comparative Oncology Laboratory, School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of California at Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Comparative Oncology Laboratory, School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of California at Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Comparative Oncology Laboratory, School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of California at Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.']",PMC4130519,,20140812,,,,,"['R01 CA121137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA076069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 121137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 076069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The unfavorable prognostic significance of complex karyotype (CK) has been reported, whereas the prognostic relevance of monosomal karyotype (MK) has not been consistently evaluated. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of CK and MK in adults with ALL treated with risk-adapted protocols of the Spanish PETHEMA Group. METHODS: The karyotypes of 881 adult ALL patients treated according to the protocols of the PETHEMA Group between 1993 and 2012 were centrally reviewed. CK and MK were assessed according to Moorman's criteria, and Breem's criteria, respectively. Specific analyses according to the risk groups and to the presence of t(9:22) were performed. RESULTS: Of 364 evaluable patients 33 (9.2%) had CK, and 68 of 535 evaluable patients (12.8%) had MK. Complete remission rate, remission duration, and overall survival were not significantly different according to the presence of CK or MK in the whole series, according to the B or T lineage, in the high-risk group, or in patients with t(9;22), regardless of imatinib treatment, and in patients who received chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CK and MK were not associated with a worse prognosis in adult patients with ALL treated with risk-adapted or subtype-oriented protocols.

The goal of the current study was to describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in this population. METHODS: Patients aged birth to 40 years at time of primary diagnosis with osteosarcoma and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2010 were eligible for inclusion in the cohort. Competing risks methods were used to estimate the cumulative incidence of SMNs and potential risk factors for developing an SMN. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and overall survival after an SMN were estimated. RESULTS: The SEER database included 3379 patients who were diagnosed with osteosarcoma as their first malignancy. Of these, 89 patients were diagnosed with an SMN. The cumulative incidence of any SMN was 2.1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.6%-2.7%) at 10 years, 4.0% (95% CI, 3.1%-5.1%) at 20 years, and 7.4% (95% CI, 5.6%-9.5%) at 30 years. The median time from the primary diagnosis to an SMN diagnosis was 6.0 years. The SIR for SMNs for survivors of osteosarcoma compared with the general population was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.5) for patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma from 1973 through 1985 and 4.7 (95% CI, 3.3-6.4) for patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma from 1986 through 2010, with a 34-fold increased risk of leukemia in this most recent era. The overall survival rate at 5 years for patients with SMNs after a diagnosis of osteosarcoma was 44.5%.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess TCF3 rearrangement in newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients in relation to clinical and laboratory parameters, CNS relapse, and clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients following at Pediatric Hematology Oncology Clinic, Ain Shams University Hospitals were included in this study. Their ages ranged from 0.75 to 16 years. Seventy six (95%) patients had B-lineage ALL and four (5%) had T-lineage ALL. Data recorded included; age, sex, extramedullary manifestations, CNS, and testes infiltrations, risk stratification, response to treatment, and CBC and BM findings. TCF3 rearrangement was assessed by FISH technique using dual color break-apart probe. RESULTS: TCF3 rearrangement [t(1;19) (q23;p13)] was detected in 16 (20%) out of the 80 studied patients, and it was significantly associated with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, CNS infiltration at presentation, high total leucocytic count, low platelet count, high-risk group, and isolated CNS relapse. These results identify a group of high-risk ALL patients with high incidence of CNS relapse and poor response to standard therapeutic regimen.

There is a shortage of published literature regarding the indications, procedure, and outcome of bone marrow examination (BME) in neonates and infants. The aim of the present study is to analyze the common indications of performing BME and to assess the spectrum of disorders diagnosed from BM of neonates and infants. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of BMEs performed in infants over a period of 5 years, between 2009 and 2013 was done. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 297 BME were performed on 285 infants, which constitutes 10.3% of pediatric BME procedures during the same period. In our institute, BME is routinely performed by trained pathologists from posterior superior iliac spine in children including infants and neonates with an overall sample adequacy of 97%. Evaluation of cytopenias and suspicion of storage disorder were the most common indications for BME procedure, while acute leukemias and storage disorders were the most common diagnoses offered in infant BM. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior superior iliac spine is a good site of BME in neonates and infants. BM trephine biopsy is a difficult procedure in this age group, however remains indispensable in situations where an infiltrative pathology is suspected. BME not only helps to make specific diagnoses but should also be used as an extremely valuable, quick, and economically viable procedure to exclude major hematological disorders including certain forms of storage disorder and hematological malignancy in this age group.",,"['Sreedharanunni, Sreejesh', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Kumar, Narender', 'Sharma, Prashant', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Ahluwalia, Jasmina', 'Das, Reena', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Marwaha, Ram Kumar']","['Sreedharanunni S', 'Sachdeva MU', 'Kumar N', 'Sharma P', 'Naseem S', 'Ahluwalia J', 'Das R', 'Varma N', 'Marwaha RK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination/methods/standards', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tertiary Care Centers']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Bone marrow aspirate', 'Bone marrow trephine biopsy', 'Infant', 'Neonates', 'Storage disorder']",2014/08/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000184 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Apr;20(3):175-81. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000184.

However, ATRA treatment also increases cytokine, chemokine, and adhesive molecule (mainly ICAM-1) expression, which can cause clinical complications, including a severe situation known as differentiation syndrome (DS) which can cause death. Therefore, it is of clinical significance to find a strategy to specifically blunt inflammatory effects while preserving differentiation. Here we report that the natural compound, celastrol, could effectively block lung infiltrations in DS animal models created by loading ATRA-induced APL cell line NB4. In ATRA-treated NB4 cells, celastrol could potently inhibit ICAM-1 elevation and partially reduce TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion, though treatment showed no effects on IL-8 and MCP-1 levels. Celastrol's effect on ICAM-1 in ATRA-treated NB4 was related to reducing MEK1/ERK1 activation.

Half of PVSG/WHO-defined ET patients show low serum erythropoietin levels and carry the JAK2(V617F) mutation, indicating prodromal PV. The positive predictive value of a JAK2(V617F) PCR test is 95% for the diagnosis of PV, and about 50% for ET and MF. The WHO-defined JAK2(V617F)-positive ET comprises three ET phenotypes at clinical and bone marrow level when the integrated WHO and European Clinical, Molecular and Pathological (ECMP) criteria are applied: normocellular ET (WHO-ET), hypercellular ET due to increased erythropoiesis (prodromal PV) and hypercellular ET associated with megakaryocytic granulocytic myeloproliferation (EMGM). Four main molecular types of clonal MPN can be distinguished: JAK2(V617F)-positive ET and PV; JAK2 wild-type ET carrying the MPL(515); mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene in JAK2/MPL wild-type ET and MF, and a small proportion of JAK2/MPL/CALR wild-type ET and MF patients. The JAK2(V617F) mutation load is low in heterozygous normocellular WHO-ET. The JAK2(V617F) mutation load in hetero-/homozygous PV and EMGM is clearly related to MPN disease burden in terms of splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms and fibrosis. The JAK2 wild-type ET carrying the MPL(515) mutation is featured by clustered small and giant megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated stag-horn-like nuclei, in a normocellular bone marrow (WHO-ET), and lacks features of PV. JAK2/MPL wild-type, CALR mutated hypercellular ET associated with PMGM is featured by dense clustered large immature dysmorphic megakaryocytes and bulky (cloud-like) hyperchromatic nuclei, which are never seen in WHO-ECMP-defined JAK2(V617F) mutated ET, EMGM and PV, and neither in JAK2 wild-type ET carrying the MPL(515) mutation. Two thirds of JAK2/MPL wild-type ET and MF patients carry one of the CALR mutations as the cause of the third distinct MPN entity. WHO-ECMP criteria are recommended to diagnose, classify and stage the broad spectrum of MPN of various molecular etiologies.","['(c) 2014 S.

We evaluated the impact of Jak2 deletion in platelets (PLTs) and megakaryocytes (MKs) on blood counts, stem/progenitor cells, and Jak-Stat signaling. Pf4-Cre-mediated Jak2 deletion in PLTs and MKs did not compromise PLT formation but caused thrombocytosis, and resulted in expansion of MK progenitors and Lin(-)Sca1(+)Kit+ cells. Serum thrombopoietin (TPO) was maintained at normal levels in Pf4-Cre-positive Jak2(f/f) mice, consistent with reduced internalization/turnover by Jak2-deficient PLTs. These data demonstrate that Jak2 in terminal megakaryopoiesis is not required for PLT production, and that Jak2 loss in PLTs and MKs results in non-autonomous expansion of stem/progenitors and of MKs and PLTs via dysregulated TPO turnover. This suggests that the thrombocytopenia frequently seen with JAK inhibitor treatment is not due to JAK2 inhibition in PLTs and MKs, but rather due to JAK2 inhibition in stem/progenitor cells.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Meyer, Sara C', 'Keller, Matthew D', 'Woods, Brittany A', 'LaFave, Lindsay M', 'Bastian, Lennart', 'Kleppe, Maria', 'Bhagwat, Neha', 'Marubayashi, Sachie', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Meyer SC', 'Keller MD', 'Woods BA', 'LaFave LM', 'Bastian L', 'Kleppe M', 'Bhagwat N', 'Marubayashi S', 'Levine RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Thrombocytosis/*metabolism', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/blood/metabolism']",,,2014/08/15 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35499-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-560441 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Oct 2;124(14):2280-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-560441.

We compared the expression of several antioxidant enzymes in these two cell lines and found that peroxiredoxin 1/2/6 and catalase are expressed at high levels in K562 cells. We further investigated the possible role of peroxirdoxin 1/2/6 and catalase in determining the cellular sensitivity to As2O3. Interestingly, knockdown of peroxiredoxin 1/2/6 did not increase the susceptibility of K562 cells to As2O3. On the contrary, knockdown of catalase markedly enhanced As2O3-induced apoptosis. In addition, we provide evidence that overexpression of BCR/ABL cannot increase the expression of PRDX 1/2/6 and catalase.

The patient did not improve on treatment with meropenem, clindamycin, or vancomycin until neutrophil recovery. Since L. rhamnosus GG is used in dairy products, and the patient ingested dairy products daily before starting chemotherapy, we suspected an association between the ingestion of dairy products and the development of infection. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using two different restriction enzymes showed that the strain isolated from the patient was identical to the L. rhamnosus GG strain isolated from dairy products and ATCC #53103.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study of 4,647 civilian, full-time workers employed at Camp Lejeune during 1973-1985 and potentially exposed to contaminated drinking water. We selected a comparison cohort of 4,690 Camp Pendleton workers employed during 1973-1985 and unexposed to contaminated drinking water. Mortality follow-up period was 1979-2008. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios utilized U.S. age-, sex-, race-, and calendar period-specific mortality rates as reference. We used survival analysis to compare mortality rates between Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton workers and assess the effects of estimated cumulative contaminant exposures within the Camp Lejeune cohort. Ground water contaminant fate/transport and distribution system models provided monthly estimated contaminant levels in drinking water serving workplaces at Camp Lejeune. The confidence interval (CI) indicated precision of effect estimates. RESULTS: Compared to Camp Pendleton, Camp Lejeune workers had mortality hazard ratios (HRs) >1.50 for kidney cancer (HR = 1.92, 95% CI: 0.58, 6.34), leukemias (HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.66, 3.84), multiple myeloma (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 0.45, 7.58), rectal cancer (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 0.36, 7.44), oral cavity cancers (HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 0.34, 10.81), and Parkinson's disease (HR = 3.13, 95% CI: 0.76, 12.81). Within the Camp Lejeune cohort, monotonic exposure-response relationships were observed for leukemia and vinyl chloride and PCE, with mortality HRs at the high exposure category of 1.72 (95% CI: 0.33, 8.83) and 1.82 (95% CI: 0.36, 9.32), respectively. Cumulative exposures were above the median for most deaths from cancers of the kidney, esophagus, rectum, prostate, and Parkinson's disease, but small numbers precluded evaluation of exposure-response relationships. CONCLUSION: The study found elevated HRs in the Camp Lejeune cohort for several causes of death including cancers of the kidney, rectum, oral cavity, leukemias, multiple myeloma, and Parkinson's disease. Only 14% of the Camp Lejeune cohort died by end of follow-up, producing small numbers of cause-specific deaths and wide CIs.

Nevertheless, disease relapse is the most important prognostic factor for the disease outcome. We aimed to elucidate the role of Wnt secretion-regulating protein, Wntless (Wls)/GPR177, on disease outcome in pediatric patients with BCP ALL, and assess its pathogenetic role in the regulation of the disease. Wls expression was characterized and correlated with Wnt pathway signaling in the bone marrow leukemia cells isolated from 44 pediatric patients with BCP ALL. The overexpression of Wls was detected in leukemia cells and was significantly correlated with the disease relapse and poor survival in the patients. The high expression of Wls also correlated with the Wnt expression and consequent downstream signaling activation, which was shown to provide essential proliferation, transformation and anti-apoptotic activity during leukemogenesis. These results indicated that Wls played an essential role in disease relapse and poor survival in patients with BCP ALL. Therefore, Wls may provide a potential future therapeutic target, particularly for patients who do not respond to existing therapies and suffer relapse.","['(c) The Author 2014.

The notable deregulated proteins for PAHs exposure were displayed as follows: lamin-A/C isoform 3 and annexin A1 for benzopyrene; lamin-A/C isoform 3 and DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha for pentacene; poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) for fluoranthene; and talin-1 and DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha for pyrene. Among them, lamin-A/C isoform 3 and PARP-1 were further confirmed using mRNA and protein expression study. Obvious morphological abnormalities including curved backbone and cardiomegaly in zebrafish were observed in the 54 hpf with more than 400 nM of benzopyrene. In conclusion, the change of mitochondrial genome (increased mtDNA copy number) was closely associated with PAH exposure in cell lines and mesenchymal stem cells.

ASNase II is an effective antineoplastic agent, used in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapy. Cloned ASNase II gene (ansB) in pAED4 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21pLysS (DE3) competent cells and expressed under optimal conditions. The lyophilized enzyme was loaded into CSNPs by ionotropic gelation method. In order to get optimal entrapment efficiency, CSNP preparation, chitosan/tripolyphosphate (CS/TPP) ratio, and protein loading were investigated. ASNase II loading into CSNPs was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and morphological observation was carried out by transmission electron microscopy. Three absolute CS/TPP ratios were studied. Entrapment efficiency and loading capacity increased with increasing CS and TPP concentration. The best ratio was applied for obtaining optimal ASNase II-loaded CSNPs with the highest entrapment efficiency. Size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and loading capacity of the optimal ASNase II-CSNPs were 340 +/- 12 nm, 21.2 +/- 3 mV, 76.2% and 47.6%, respectively. The immobilized enzyme showed an increased in vitro half-life in comparison with the free enzyme. The pH and thermostability of the immobilized enzyme was comparable with the free enzyme. This study leads to a better understanding of how to prepare CSNPs, how to achieve high encapsulation efficiency for a high molecular weight protein, and how to prolong the release of protein from CSNPs. A conceptual understanding of biological responses to ASNase II-loaded CSNPs is needed for the development of novel methods of drug delivery.",,"['Bahreini, Elham', 'Aghaiypour, Khosrow', 'Abbasalipourkabir, Roghayeh', 'Mokarram, Ali Rezaei', 'Goodarzi, Mohammad Taghi', 'Saidijam, Massoud']","['Bahreini E', 'Aghaiypour K', 'Abbasalipourkabir R', 'Mokarram AR', 'Goodarzi MT', 'Saidijam M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nanoscale Res Lett,Nanoscale research letters,101279750,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cross-linking', 'Enzyme immobilization', 'Half-life', 'Ionotropic gelation', 'Nanoparticle', 'Optimization']",2014/08/13 06:00,2014/08/13 06:01,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1556-276X-9-340 [doi]', '1556-276X-9-340 [pii]']",epublish,Nanoscale Res Lett. 2014 Jul 9;9(1):340. doi: 10.1186/1556-276X-9-340. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1186/1556-276X-9-340 [doi],"['Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517619651, Iran.', 'Department of Genomics and Genetic Engineering, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute (RVSRI), Karaj 3197619751, Iran.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517619651, Iran.', 'Department of Genomics and Genetic Engineering, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute (RVSRI), Karaj 3197619751, Iran.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517619651, Iran.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517619651, Iran.']",PMC4110547,,20140709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complete clinical details, investigations, treatment and follow-up were obtained from Medical Oncology records. The peripheral blood picture, bone marrow cytology and trephine sections along with special stains were reviewed. There were 12 cases of HCL during the study period with a M:F ratio of 11:1. Of these, ten were diagnosed as classical HCL and two as variant HCL. The most common clinical manifestations were fever, easy fatigability and weakness. Splenomegaly was present in 81.8 % cases.

Although understanding of genetic and epigenetic changes of childhood leukemia has improved, the causes of childhood leukemia and the potential role of environmental exposures in leukemogenesis remain largely unknown. Although many epidemiologic studies have examined a variety of environmental exposures, ionizing radiation remains the only generally accepted environmental risk factor for childhood leukemia. Among suspected risk factors, infections, exposure to pesticides, and extremely low frequency magnetic fields are notable. While there are well-defined differences between leukemia in children with and without DS, studies of risk factors for leukemia among DS children are generally consistent with trends seen among non-DS (NDS) children. We provide background on DS epidemiology and review the similarities and differences in biological and epidemiologic features of leukemia in children with and without DS. We propose that both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloblastic leukemia among DS children can serve as an informative model for development of childhood leukemia. Further, the high rates of leukemia among DS children make it possible to study this disease using a cohort approach, a powerful method that is unfeasible in the general population due to the rarity of childhood leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two thousand one hundred seventy-eight female adult survivors of childhood cancer and 408 female siblings from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) completed a self-report questionnaire about their psychosexual functioning and quality of life. On average, participants were age 29 years (range, 18 to 51 years) at the time of the survey, had been diagnosed with cancer at a median age of 8.5 years (range, 0 to 20) and were most commonly diagnosed with leukemia (33.2%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (15.4%). RESULTS: Multivariable analyses suggested that after controlling for sociodemographic differences, survivors reported significantly lower sexual functioning (mean difference [MnD], -0.2; P = .01), lower sexual interest (MnD, -0.2; P < .01), lower sexual desire (MnD, -0.3; P < .01), lower sexual arousal (MnD, -0.3; P < .01), lower sexual satisfaction (MnD, -0.2; P = .01), and lower sexual activity (MnD, -0.1; P = .02) compared with siblings. Risk factors for poorer psychosexual functioning among survivors included older age at assessment, ovarian failure at a younger age, treatment with cranial radiation, and cancer diagnosis during adolescence. CONCLUSION: Decreased sexual functioning among female survivors of childhood cancers seems to be unrelated to emotional factors and is likely to be an underaddressed issue. Several risk factors among survivors have been identified that assist in defining high-risk subgroups who may benefit from targeted screening and interventions.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Ford, Jennifer S', 'Kawashima, Toana', 'Whitton, John', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Sklar, Charles A']","['Ford JS', 'Kawashima T', 'Whitton J', 'Leisenring W', 'Laverdiere C', 'Stovall M', 'Zeltzer L', 'Robison LL', 'Sklar CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/psychology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/psychology', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual Behavior/psychology', 'Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/*psychology', 'Siblings', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/08/13 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2013.54.1086 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2013.54.1086 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2014 Oct 1;32(28):3126-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2013.54.1086.

A workshop was held at the 11th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano, Switzerland, in June 2011, that included leading hematologists, oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and nuclear medicine physicians, representing major international lymphoma clinical trials groups and cancer centers. Clinical and imaging subcommittees presented their conclusions at a subsequent workshop at the 12th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma, leading to revised criteria for staging and of the International Working Group Guidelines of 2007 for response. As a result, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) was formally incorporated into standard staging for FDG-avid lymphomas. A modification of the Ann Arbor descriptive terminology will be used for anatomic distribution of disease extent, but the suffixes A or B for symptoms will only be included for HL. A bone marrow biopsy is no longer indicated for the routine staging of HL and most diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. However, regardless of stage, general practice is to treat patients based on limited (stages I and II, nonbulky) or advanced (stage III or IV) disease, with stage II bulky disease considered as limited or advanced disease based on histology and a number of prognostic factors. PET-CT will be used to assess response in FDG-avid histologies using the 5-point scale. The product of the perpendicular diameters of a single node can be used to identify progressive disease. Routine surveillance scans are discouraged.

For instance, an important relationship between Clostridium septicum and colon carcinoma as well as between leukemia or lymphoma with species frequently considered contaminants (Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp.) or others rarely isolated from different contexts (Capnocytophaga spp.) were described. Some bacteria are almost exclusively isolated from AIDS patients (Rhodococcus equi). Campylobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., group G and mitis group streptococci were more frequently isolated in individuals suffering from any type of cancer than in other patients. Furthermore, some other bacteria can be considered markers of an undetected cancer that can be found mostly in neutropenic patients rather than in immunologically normal individuals. Possible mechanisms of bacterial oncogenesis include a modification of the inflammatory response, antigen-derived lymphoproliferation, and induction of hormones that increase epithelial cell proliferation. Typical examples of the above are: gastric adenocarcinoma induced by Helicobacter pylori, the association between group bovis bacteremia and colon carcinoma and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) related to Helicobacter species (gastric MALT) and Chlamydophila spp. (ocular MALT). Isolation of any of these pathogens should require a thorough search for possible malignant diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Asociacion Colombiana de Psiquiatria. Publicado por Elsevier', 'Espana.

A lot of studies have reported the association of XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism with risk of cancer, but the results remained controversial. Hence, we performed a systematic review and conducted a meta-analysis to explore association of the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism with risk of cancer (78,398 cases and 103,178 controls from 224 studies). Overall, a significantly increased cancer risk was found in all genetic models (dominant model: odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.14; recessive model: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05-1.15; homozygous model: OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08-1.21; heterozygous model: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05-1.12; additive model: OR = 1.08, 95% CI= 1.05-1.11) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, the elevated risk of cancer remained for subgroups of breast cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, and melanoma. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism is a genetic susceptibility for some cancer types. Moreover, ethnicity, histological type of cancer, and smokers seem to contribute to varying expressions of the Lys751Gln on some cancer risk. In addition, our work also points out the importance of new studies for Lys751Gln association in endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, where at least some of the covariates responsible for heterogeneity could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the Lys751Gln polymorphism in cancer development.",,"['Wu, Kai-Ge', 'He, Xiao-Feng', 'Li, Yun-Hui', 'Xie, Wei-Bin', 'Huang, Xi']","['Wu KG', 'He XF', 'Li YH', 'Xie WB', 'Huang X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['EC 3.6.4.12 (Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein)', 'EC 5.99.- (ERCC2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein/*genetics']",,,2014/08/13 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2379-x [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Nov;35(11):11243-59. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2379-x.

We used the Jurkat T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia model to characterize the role of pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels in the release of nucleotides during chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Diverse pro-apoptotic drugs, including topoisomerase II inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and proteosome inhibitors, induced functional activation of Panx1 channels via caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the Panx1 autoinhibitory C-terminal domain. The caspase-activated Panx1 channels mediated efflux of ATP, but also ADP and AMP, with the latter two comprising >90% of the released adenine nucleotide pool as cells transitioned from the early to late stages of apoptosis. Chemotherapeutic drugs also activated an alternative caspase- and Panx1-independent pathway for ATP release from Jurkat cells in the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor. Comparison of Panx1 levels indicated much higher expression in leukemic T lymphocytes than in normal, untransformed T lymphoblasts. This suggests that signaling roles for Panx1 may be amplified in leukemic leukocytes. Together, these results identify chemotherapy-activated pannexin-1 channels and ATP release as possible mediators of paracrine interaction between dying tumor cells and the effector leukocytes that mediate immunogenic anti-tumor responses.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Boyd-Tressler, Andrea', 'Penuela, Silvia', 'Laird, Dale W', 'Dubyak, George R']","['Boyd-Tressler A', 'Penuela S', 'Laird DW', 'Dubyak GR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Connexins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PANX1 protein, human)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Connexins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATP', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase', 'Pannexin', 'Purinergic Agonist']",2014/08/13 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)37178-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.590240 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 26;289(39):27246-27263. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.590240.

In recent years, a variety of polymorphisms in DDR genes have been associated with increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or of disease relapse. Moreover, a growing body of literature has indicated that epigenetic silencing of DDR genes could contribute to the leukemogenic process. In addition, a variety of AML oncogenes have been shown to induce replication and oxidative stress leading to accumulation of DNA damage, which affects the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, upregulation of DDR genes can provide AML cells with escape mechanisms to the DDR anticancer barrier and induce chemotherapy resistance.

PROCEDURE: To longitudinally assess presence and changes of sleep complaints and fatigue, we administered questionnaires designed to measure sleep complaints, sleep habits, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue to parents of pediatric oncology patients ages 2-18 and to pediatric oncology patients, themselves, ages 8-18 within 30 days of diagnosis (n = 170) and again 8 weeks later (n = 153). RESULTS: Bedtimes, wake times, and sleep duration remained relatively stable across the first 8 weeks of treatment. Sleep duration and fatigue were not related for the entire sample, though children's self-reported sleep duration was positively correlated with fatigue only at the baseline time point. Parent reports of fatigue significantly decreased for leukemia patients but remained rather high for solid tumor and brain tumor patients. CONCLUSIONS: Because fatigue remained high for solid tumor and brain tumor patients across the initial 8 weeks of treatment, this may highlight the need for intervention in this patient population.",,"['Crabtree, Valerie McLaughlin', 'Rach, Amanda M', 'Schellinger, Kriston B', 'Russell, Kathryn M', 'Hammarback, Teresa', 'Mandrell, Belinda N']","['Crabtree VM', 'Rach AM', 'Schellinger KB', 'Russell KM', 'Hammarback T', 'Mandrell BN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Dyssomnias/diagnosis/etiology', '*Fatigue/diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/classification/complications/diagnosis', 'Parents', 'Self Report', 'Sleep', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",,,2014/08/13 06:00,2015/08/22 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2013/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2356-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 Feb;23(2):393-401. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2356-3.

Although studies in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have shown that the addition of l-asparaginase improved the overall remission rate, life-threatening acute pancreatitis has occurred in 0.5-4% of patients. We describe the first adult case report, to our knowledge, of the successful use of octreotide as a chemoprotectant for the prevention of recurrent pegylated asparaginase (PEG-ASP)-induced pancreatitis in a 21-year-old man with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After recurrent PEG-ASP administration during induction chemotherapy, he developed necrotizing pancreatitis, confirmed by abdominal computed tomography, and further asparaginase therapy was withheld. Currently, there are no specific treatment recommendations for the management of asparaginase-induced pancreatitis other than drug discontinuation. After disease relapse, a pediatric PEG-ASP-containing regimen was initiated, and PEG-ASP therapy was resumed due to its potential clinical benefit. Octreotide 100 mug subcutaneously 3 times/day, utilized as a chemoprotectant, was found to prevent pancreatitis recurrence. The patient completed therapy and was able to receive a bone marrow transplant without further complications from PEG-ASP therapy. Based on this patient's experience, we believe it is reasonable to reincorporate PEG-ASP after an episode of pancreatitis with use of octreotide as a chemoprotectant; however, this conclusion will need to be substantiated in a randomized clinical trial with a larger group of patients.","['(c) 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Buie, Larry W', 'Moore, Joseph', 'van Deventer, Hank']","['Buie LW', 'Moore J', 'van Deventer H']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Octreotide/*therapeutic use', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['PEG-asparaginase', 'chemoprotectant', 'octreotide', 'pancreatitis']",2014/08/13 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1460 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2014 Aug;34(8):e149-51. doi: 10.1002/phar.1460.,34,10.1002/phar.1460 [doi],"['Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Health Care, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDBD has cytotoxic effects and induces apoptosis via phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. However, the mechanism of action of EDBD has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms of EDBD in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. EDBD arrested the growth of S. cerevisiae cells by suppressing progression from the G1 phase to the S phase and from the G2 phase to the M phase. Moreover, biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that EDBD activated environmental stress-response pathways involving Hog1 and affected Cln3/G1 cyclin activity, thereby inhibiting the expression of SCB-binding factor and MCB-binding factor target genes. Our results provided important insights into the functions of EDBD in tumor cells and may facilitate the development of EDBD-based antitumor therapies.

Intriguingly, leukemia cells exposed to platelet components demonstrate a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsiM) and a transient increase in oxygen consumption, suggestive of mitochondrial uncoupling. Accompanying the ranolazine-sensitive increase in oxygen consumption, a reduction in triglyceride content was also observed in leukemia cells cultured with platelet components indicating that lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation may support the molecular reduction of oxygen in these cells. Mechanistically, platelet components antagonized Bax oligomerization in accordance with previous observations supporting an antiapoptotic role for fatty acid oxidation in leukemia cells. Lastly, substantiating the notion that mitochondrial uncoupling reduces oxidative stress, platelet components induced a marked decrease in basal and rotenone-induced superoxide levels in leukemia cells. Taken together, the decrease in DeltaPsiM, the transient increase in ranolazine-sensitive oxygen consumption, the reduction in triglyceride levels, and the reduced generation of superoxide, all accompanying the increased resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis, substantiate the hypothesis that platelets may contribute to the chemoprotective sanctuary of the bone marrow microenvironment via promotion of mitochondrial uncoupling.",,"['Velez, Juliana', 'Enciso, Leonardo Jose', 'Suarez, Marta', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Grismaldo, Adriana', 'Lopez, Catalina', 'Barreto, Alfonso', 'Cardozo, Claudia', 'Palacios, Pilar', 'Morales, Ludis', 'Duque, Jorge Eduardo', 'Carmona, Jorge Uriel', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Samudio, Ismael']","['Velez J', 'Enciso LJ', 'Suarez M', 'Fiegl M', 'Grismaldo A', 'Lopez C', 'Barreto A', 'Cardozo C', 'Palacios P', 'Morales L', 'Duque JE', 'Carmona JU', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Samudio I']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Microenviron,Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society,101322634,,,,,,2014/08/13 06:00,2014/08/13 06:01,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12307-014-0149-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Microenviron. 2014 Aug;7(1-2):79-90. doi: 10.1007/s12307-014-0149-3.

Although the 5-year survival rate from childhood cancer has increased significantly over the years due to advances in treatment technologies, cancer is still one of the leading causes of death among children in westernized countries. Leukemia and lymphoma are two of the most common cancer types in children and together account for about 45% of all childhood cancers. Nevertheless, very little is known of the etiology of childhood leukemia and lymphoma. Several studies had looked into the question of a relationship between infant nutrition--breastfeeding or lack thereof--and the risk of childhood leukemia and lymphoma as part of the ""infective agent theory"". This review aims to describe the current scientific evidence regarding the possible connection between breastfeeding and childhood malignancies, with an emphasis on childhood and adolescent leukemia and lymphoma. To that end, a systematic review of past studies has been conducted using Pubmed. Furthermore, the bibliographies of the relevant studies found on Pubmed were consulted. Studies were divided into two groups: original studies, and systematic reviews and meta analyses. Based on the Literature review, it is evident that the results are still inconclusive--some studies found a connection between breastfeeding and a lower risk of childhood leukemia and lymphoma, while others found no connection. The variability in breastfeeding and childhood cancer rates among the different populations where studies were conducted is large. In view of that variability and the differing results of former studies, there is a need to continue research. Israel, with characteristics of both a westernized country and a more traditional society with respect to parity and breastfeeding, is a good place to conduct such a study, with possible important implications for public health.",,"['Amitay, Efrat', 'Keinan-Boker, Lital']","['Amitay E', 'Keinan-Boker L']",['heb'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', '*Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/08/13 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/08/13 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,"Harefuah. 2014 May;153(5):273-9, 305, 304.",153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modifiable factors, such as parenting strategies, may be an appropriate target for interventions to assist families with managing their child's behavior, potentially leading to improved psychosocial and clinical outcomes. This study examined whether parenting strategies are associated with child behavioral and emotional problems in a pediatric oncology context, with the aim of establishing whether parenting is a potential modifiable target for psychosocial intervention. PROCEDURE: Participants included 73 parents of children aged 2-6 years who were either (i) in the maintenance phase of treatment for ALL at the Royal Children's Hospital Children's Cancer Centre, Melbourne (N = 43), or (ii) had no major medical history (healthy control group) (N = 30). Participants completed psychometrically validated questionnaires that assessed parenting strategies and child emotional and behavioral problems. RESULTS: Results revealed that the ALL group parents reported higher lax parenting and more spoiling and bribing of their child than the healthy control group. Results from regression models indicated that, after controlling for the significant contribution of illness status and child age on child emotional and behavioral difficulties, parental laxness and parental overprotection were significantly associated with child emotional and behavioral difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting parents to minimise sub-optimal parenting strategies, particularly lax parenting, may offer a fruitful avenue for future research directed toward modifiable factors associated with managing child emotional and behavioral problems in a pediatric oncology context.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Williams, Lauren K', 'Lamb, Karen E', 'McCarthy, Maria C']","['Williams LK', 'Lamb KE', 'McCarthy MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Affective Symptoms/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders/*etiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parenting/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'child behavior', 'parenting', 'pediatric oncology', 'psycho-oncology']",2014/08/12 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/08/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25164 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Nov;61(11):2065-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25164.

Identification of cancer cell dependency on a number of these mutations has quickly resulted in the development of therapies targeting several of these genetic alterations. This includes, the development of mutant-selective IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors, DOT1L inhibitors for MLL rearranged leukemias, EZH2 inhibitors for several cancer types, and the development of bromodomain inhibitors for many cancer types--all of which are in early phase clinical trials.

To further improve their efficacy in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we investigated their synergism with sorafenib (Sor). Exposure of FLT3-ITD-positive MV-4-11 and MOLM 13 cells to Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity; no such synergism was observed in the FLT3-wild type THP-1 and KBM3/Bu250(6) cell lines. The drug synergism in MV-4-11 cells could be attributed to activation of DNA damage response, histone 3 modifications, inhibition of prosurvival kinases, and activation of apoptosis. Further, the phosphorylation of kinases, including FLT3, MAPK kinase (MEK), and AKT, was inhibited. The FLT3-ITD substrate STAT5 and its target gene PIM 2 product decreased when cells were exposed to Sor alone, Bu+Clo+Flu, and Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor. The level of the proapoptotic protein p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) increased, whereas the level of prosurvival protein MCL-1 decreased when cells were exposed to Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor. The interactions of PUMA with MCL-1 and/or BCL-2 were enhanced when cells were exposed to Bu+Clo+Flu or Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor. The changes in the level of these proteins, which are involved in mitochondrial control of apoptosis, correlate with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor decreased mitochondrial membrane potential by 60% and caused leakage of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)/direct IAP Binding protein with low pI (DIABLO), and AIF from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, caspase activation, and cell death, suggesting the activation of apoptosis. Analogous, synergistic cytotoxicity in response to Bu, Clo, Flu, and Sor was observed in mononuclear cells isolated from FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. Although our previous studies were aimed at standardizing the conditioning regimen, the new findings suggest that patients with abnormal expression of FLT3 might further benefit from individualizing treatment through the addition of Sor to Bu+Clo+Flu, thereby providing personalized pretransplantation therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed 264 adults with CBF-AML from 2002 to 2011, and focused on 206 patients who achieved CR after standard '3+7' induction chemotherapy. Patients who achieved CR with an available donor were treated with allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT, n=115) and the rest were treated with autologous (auto) HSCT (n=72) or chemotherapy alone (n=19). OS was not significantly different between CBFbeta/MYH11 (n=62) and RUNX1/RUNX1T1 (n=144), and auto-HSCT showed favorable OS compared with allo-HSCT or chemotherapy alone. Cytogenetic analysis identified that inv(16) without trisomy had a favorable OS and t(8;21) with additional chromosomes had an unfavorable OS, but multivariate analysis revealed those were NS. Patients with c-kit mutation showed inferior OS. For transplanted patients, residual post-transplant CBF-minimal residual disease quantitative PCR with higher WT1 expression at D+60 showed the worst OS with a higher incidence of relapse.

The goals of this analysis were to comprehensively describe risks of NHL subtypes, especially those not well studied, among HIV/AIDS patients; examine risks specifically in the HAART era; and distinguish risks in HIV-infected individuals prior to diagnosis with AIDS. DESIGN: Population-based registry linkage study. METHODS: We used data from the US HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study from 1996 to 2010 (N = 273 705) to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) comparing subtype-specific NHL risks in HIV-infected people to those in the general population, and used Poisson regression to test for differences in SIRs between the HIV-only and AIDS periods. RESULTS: NHL risk was elevated 11-fold compared to the general population, but varied substantially by subtype. AIDS-defining NHL subtypes comprised the majority, and risks were high (SIRs >/=17), but risks were also increased for some T-cell lymphomas (SIRs = 3.6-14.2), marginal zone lymphoma (SIR = 2.4), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (SIR = 3.6), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (SIR = 2.4). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected people in the HAART era continue to have elevated risk of AIDS-defining NHL subtypes, highlighting the contribution of moderate and severe immunosuppression to their cause. Whereas non-AIDS-defining subtypes are much less common, immunosuppression or other dysregulated immune states likely play a role in the cause of some T-cell lymphomas, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.",,"['Gibson, Todd M', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Shiels, Meredith S', 'Clarke, Christina A', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Gibson TM', 'Morton LM', 'Shiels MS', 'Clarke CA', 'Engels EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,,IM,"['Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active/*methods', 'HIV Infections/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Risk Assessment', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/08/12 06:00'],"['2014/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QAD.0000000000000428 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2014 Sep 24;28(15):2313-8. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000000428.,28,10.1097/QAD.0000000000000428 [doi],"[""aDivision of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics bCancer Prevention Fellowship Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland cCancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California, USA. *Current affiliation: Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",PMC4260326,,,,,,,"['U58 DP003931/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', '5U58DP000824-04/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', '5U58DP003931-02/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000848-04/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201300021I/PHS HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201300021C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000024C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U58DP003875-01/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'N01PC-2013-00021/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000824/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003875/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', '5U58DP000812-03/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000848/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000812/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS643427'],,,,,,,,,

Data on RS is sparse and mostly derived from case reports or small series of patients and only a few larger cohorts have been published. The purpose of this large retrospective study was to summarize our national experience with RS in CLL, examine possible risk factors, and analyze relevant demographic, laboratory and clinical parameters, including results of therapy and outcome. We first evaluated data obtained from 119 patients with RS diagnosed during 1971-2010 from 12 medical centers in Israel. The final cohort summarized consisted of 81 patients with RS who developed only diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after exclusion all cases with insufficient data and those who were not DLBCL. Median overall survival from time of diagnosis of RS was 8 months; after applying the Richter score, patients could be stratified into three prognostic groups, while all other clinical and laboratory parameters evaluated had no prognostic significance. Prior therapy for CLL had no impact on RS survival (P = 0.8) and patients with therapy ""naive"" RS and those who had already received chemotherapy prior to developing RS, had the same survival. The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy for RS improved 2 years overall survival from 19% in the chemotherapy alone arm to 42% (P value of 0.001).

We have subsequently discovered that HCL is really at least two diseases: classical HCL and the hairy cell leukemia variant. The former is among a small group of cancers exceptional for being (nearly) unified by a single genetic lesion, the BRAF V600E mutation. Over the past three decades, tremendous progress in both diagnostic and prognostic clarification has been accompanied by therapeutic advances in classical HCL. Consequently, this once uniformly fatal disease has been converted in most cases into a chronic illness enabling patients to live long and productive lives. In response to standard therapy, patients have high complete remission rates. Unfortunately, the long-term survival curves have not plateaued, revealing that this disease is controlled but not cured. Though rare and representing only about 10% of an already rare disease, those patients with the variant fare exceptionally poorly with standard therapy: complete response rates to purine nucleoside analogs are reported to be less than 50%, whereas the complete response rates in classical HCL are up to 90%. Novel small molecules targeting BRAF and the B-cell receptor signaling complex, and biologic agents like antibodies and immunotoxin conjugates are being explored for those patients who have relapsed. Substantial opportunities for continued research remain. This complex and multi-faceted disease incorporates challenges from altered immunity associated with the underlying disease and its treatments. Considering the rarity of this malignancy, optimization of patient management requires multi-institutional collaboration.

Current TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapies effectively inhibit BCR-Abl to control CML in the majority of patients, but do not eliminate the LSC (leukaemic stem cell) population, which becomes quiescent following treatment. Patients require long-term treatment to sustain remission; alternative strategies are therefore required, either alone or in combination with TKIs to eliminate the LSCs and provide a cure. The embryonic morphogenetic pathways play a key role in haemopoiesis with recent evidence suggesting LSCs are more dependent on these signals following chemotherapy than normal HSCs (haemopoietic stem cells). Recent evidence in the literature and from our group has revealed that the BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) pathway is differentially expressed in CML patients compared with normal donors.

Furthermore, looking at the involvement of these switching signalling pathways that may be aberrant in leukaemia informs us of their importance in cancer tumorigenesis and how they may be targeted pharmacologically to treat various types of human leukaemias. Furthermore, these important pathways may play a crucial role in acquired chemotherapy resistance and should be studied further to overcome in the clinic many drug-resistant forms of blood cancers.

Relapse remains the leading cause of death for HR-AML patients after haplo-HSCT. Accordingly, the prevention of relapse remains a challenge in the treatment of HR-AML. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in southwestern China, 178 HR-AML patients received haplo-HSCT with conditioning regimens involving recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) or non-rhG-CSF. The cumulative incidences of relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. HR-AML patients who underwent the priming conditioning regimen with rhG-CSF had a lower relapse rate than those who were treated with non-rhG-CSF (38.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28.1% to 48.3% versus 60.7%, 95% CI, 50.5% to 70.8%; P < .01). The cumulative incidences of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, transplantation-related toxicity, and infectious complications appeared to be equivalent. In total, 53 patients in the rhG-CSF-priming group and 31 patients in the non-rhG-CSF-priming group were still alive at the median follow-up time of 42 months (range, 24 to 80 months). The 2-year probabilities of LFS and OS in the rhG-CSF-priming and non-rhG-CSF-priming groups were 55.1% (95% CI, 44.7% to 65.4%) versus 32.6% (95% CI, 22.8% to 42.3%) (P < .01) and 59.6% (95% CI, 49.4% to 69.7%) versus 34.8% (95% CI, 24.9% to 44.7%) (P < .01), respectively. Multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-year probability of LFS of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) before transplantation was better than that of patients who did not achieve CR. The 2-year probability of LFS of patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype was better than that of patients with the M4/M5/M6 subtype in the G-CSF-priming group (67.4%; 95% CI, 53.8% to 80.9% versus 41.9%; 95% CI, 27.1% to 56.6%; P < .05).

To date, multiple extracellular stimuli and transcription factors have been shown to regulate EMT. Many of them are not druggable and therefore it is necessary to identify targets, which can be inhibited using small molecules to prevent metastasis. Recently, we identified the ganglioside GD2 as a novel breast cancer stem cell marker. Moreover, we found that GD3 synthase (GD3S)--an enzyme involved in GD2 biosynthesis--is critical for GD2 production and could serve as a potential druggable target for inhibiting tumor initiation and metastasis. Indeed, there is a small molecule known as triptolide that has been shown to inhibit GD3S function. Accordingly, in this manuscript, we demonstrate that the inhibition of GD3S using small hairpin RNA or triptolide compromises the initiation and maintenance of EMT instigated by various signaling pathways, including Snail, Twist and transforming growth factor-beta1 as well as the mesenchymal characteristics of claudin-low breast cancer cell lines (SUM159 and MDA-MB-231). Moreover, GD3S is necessary for wound healing, migration, invasion and stem cell properties in vitro. Most importantly, inhibition of GD3S in vivo prevents metastasis in experimental as well as in spontaneous syngeneic wild-type mouse models. We also demonstrate that the transcription factor FOXC2, a central downstream effector of several EMT pathways, directly regulates GD3S expression by binding to its promoter. In clinical specimens, the expression of GD3S correlates with poor prognosis in triple-negative human breast tumors. Moreover, GD3S expression correlates with activation of the c-Met signaling pathway leading to increased stem cell properties and metastatic competence. Collectively, these findings suggest that the GD3S-c-Met axis could serve as an effective target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancers.",,"['Sarkar, T R', 'Battula, V L', 'Werden, S J', 'Vijay, G V', 'Ramirez-Pena, E Q', 'Taube, J H', 'Chang, J T', 'Miura, N', 'Porter, W', 'Sphyris, N', 'Andreeff, M', 'Mani, S A']","['Sarkar TR', 'Battula VL', 'Werden SJ', 'Vijay GV', 'Ramirez-Pena EQ', 'Taube JH', 'Chang JT', 'Miura N', 'Porter W', 'Sphyris N', 'Andreeff M', 'Mani SA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (mesenchyme fork head 1 protein)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.8 (alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*drug effects', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Sialyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/08/12 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014245 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.245 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jun 4;34(23):2958-67. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.245.

Using this screen, we identified interleukin-2 gamma receptor (IL2Rgamma) as a critical growth determinant for a JAK3(A572V) mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia cell line. We observed that knockdown of IL2Rgamma abrogates phosphorylation of JAK3 and downstream signaling molecules, JAK1, STAT5, MAPK and pS6 ribosomal protein. Overexpression of IL2Rgamma in murine cells increased the transforming potential of activating JAK3 mutations, whereas absence of IL2Rgamma completely abrogated the clonogenic potential of JAK3(A572V), as well as the transforming potential of additional JAK3-activating mutations such as JAK3(M511I). In addition, mutation at the IL2Rgamma interaction site in the FERM domain of JAK3 (Y100C) completely abrogated JAK3-mediated leukemic transformation. Mechanistically, we found IL2Rgamma contributes to constitutive JAK3 mutant signaling by increasing JAK3 expression and phosphorylation. Conversely, we found that mutant, but not wild-type JAK3, increased the expression of IL2Rgamma, indicating IL2Rgamma and JAK3 contribute to constitutive JAK/STAT signaling through their reciprocal regulation. Overall, we demonstrate a novel role for IL2Rgamma in potentiating oncogenesis in the setting of JAK3-mutation-positive leukemia.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying the progression of PDAC remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in various human cancers as cancer suppressors or oncogenes. MicroRNA-183 (miR-183) was recently reported to be dysregulated in various types of cancer and to play an important role in the processes of cancer. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of action of miR-183 in PDAC have not been explored. In the present study, low expression of miR-183 was observed in PDAC tissues and cell lines. Low expression of miR-183 in PDAC was significantly associated with tumor grade, metastasis and TNM stage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients harboring low expression of miR-183 had a significantly reduced overall survival than patients with a high level of miR-183 expression. The present study revealed that B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) expression was inversely correlated with miR-183. Our findings also demonstrated that a low level of miR-183 expression effectively suppressed the growth of PDAC cells via regulation of Bmi-1. Following Bmi-1 silencing or upregulation of miR-183, the expression levels of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 and CDK4 were decreased. It is reasonable to conclude that alteration of miR-183 expression may regulate the function of PDAC cells by the downregulation of Bmi-1 expression.",,"['Zhou, Liang', 'Zhang, Wei-Guo', 'Wang, De-Sheng', 'Tao, Kai-Shan', 'Song, Wen-Jie', 'Dou, Ke-Feng']","['Zhou L', 'Zhang WG', 'Wang DS', 'Tao KS', 'Song WJ', 'Dou KF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN183 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/08/12 06:00'],"['2014/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2014.3374 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2014 Oct;32(4):1734-40. doi: 10.3892/or.2014.3374.

Bone marrow remains the traditional source tissue for MSCs but is relatively hard to access in large volumes. Alternatively, MSCs may be derived from other tissues including the placenta and adipose tissue. In an initial study no obvious differences in parameters such as cell surface phenotype, chemokine receptor display, mesodermal differentiation capacity or immunosuppressive ability, were detected when we compared human marrow derived-MSCs to human placenta-derived MSCs. The aim of this study was to establish and evaluate a protocol and related processes for preparation placenta-derived MSCs for early phase clinical trials. METHODS: A full-term placenta was taken after delivery of the baby as a source of MSCs. Isolation, seeding, incubation, cryopreservation of human placenta-derived MSCs and used production release criteria were in accordance with the complex regulatory requirements applicable to Code of Good Manufacturing Practice manufacturing of ex vivo expanded cells. RESULTS: We established and evaluated instructions for MSCs preparation protocol and gave an overview of the three clinical areas application. In the first trial, MSCs were co-transplanted iv to patient receiving an allogeneic cord blood transplant as therapy for treatment-refractory acute myeloid leukemia. In the second trial, MSCs were administered iv in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and without serious adverse effects. In the third trial, MSCs were injected directly into the site of tendon damage using ultrasound guidance in the treatment of chronic refractory tendinopathy. CONCLUSION: Clinical trials using both allogeneic and autologous cells demonstrated MSCs to be safe. A described protocol for human placenta-derived MSCs is appropriate for use in a clinical setting, relatively inexpensive and can be relatively easily adjusted to a different set of regulatory requirements, as applicable to early phase clinical trials.",,"['Ilic, Nina', 'Atkinson, Kerry']","['Ilic N', 'Atkinson K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,IM,"['Cell Separation', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Placenta/*cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Specimen Handling/*methods']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/08/12 06:00'],"['2014/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/vsp130410050i [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2014 Jul;71(7):651-9. doi: 10.2298/vsp130410050i.,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of patients with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) according to insurance status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed, covering all patients with AML and high-risk MDS evaluated and treated at Akron General Medical Center between 2002 and 2012. A Cox regression model was analyzed to account for survival over time, adjusted for insurance type, while controlling for patient age at diagnosis and patient risk of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 130 adult patients (age >/= 18 years) were identified. Insurance information was available for 97 patients enrolled in the study; 3 were excluded because of self-pay status. Cox regression analysis with insurance type as the predictor found that overall survival declines over time and that the rate of decline may be influenced by insurance type (chi(2)(2) = 6.4; P = .044). The likelihood of survival in patients with Medicaid or Medicare without supplemental insurance was .552 (95% CI, .338-.903; P = .018) times the likelihood in patients who had Medicare with supplemental insurance. To explain the difference, variables of age, gender, and risk of mortality were added to the model. Age and risk of mortality were found to be significant predictors of survival. The addition of insurance type to the model did not significantly contribute (chi(2)(3) = 3.83; P = .147). CONCLUSION: No significant difference in overall survival was observed when patients with AML or high-risk MDS were analyzed according to their health insurance status.

METHODS: A CD19.CAR gene was delivered into mononuclear cells from 10 mL of blood of healthy donors through the use of piggyBac-transposons and the 4-D Nucleofector System. Nucleofected cells were stimulated with CD3/CD28 antibodies, magnetically selected for the CD19.CAR, and cultured in interleukin-15-containing serum-free medium with autologous feeder cells for 21 days. To evaluate their cytotoxic potency, we co-cultured CAR T cells with seven Ph(+)ALL cell lines including three TKI-resistant (T315I-mutated) lines at an effector-to-target ratio of 1:5 or lower without cytokines. RESULTS: We obtained approximately 1.3 x 10(8) CAR T cells (CD4(+), 25.4%; CD8(+), 71.3%), co-expressing CD45RA and CCR7 up to approximately 80%. After 7-day co-culture, CAR T cells eradicated all tumor cells at the 1:5 and 1:10 ratios and substantially reduced tumor cell numbers at the 1:50 ratio. Kinetic analysis revealed up to 37-fold proliferation of CAR T cells during a 20-day culture period in the presence of tumor cells. On exposure to tumor cells, CAR T cells transiently and reproducibly upregulated the expression of transgene as well as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and interleukin-2. CONCLUSIONS: We generated a clinically relevant number of CAR T cells from 10 mL of blood through the use of piggyBac-transposons, a 4D-Nulcleofector, and serum/xeno/tumor cell/virus-free culture system. CAR T cells exhibited marked cytotoxicity against Ph(+)ALL regardless of T315I mutation. PiggyBac-mediated CD19-specific T-cell therapy may provide an effective, inexpensive and safe option for drug-resistant Ph(+)ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Screening for TERT A1062T mutation in exon 15 of the TERT gene was performed on diagnostic DNA samples from 153 AML patients and 197 healthy subjects as a control group by using sequence-specific primers. TERT A1062T mutation was detected in 18 cases out of 153 patients (11.8 %) and in one out of 197 control group subjects (0.51 %). The achievement of complete remission was significantly higher in AML group with wild type as compared to that in the mutant one (53.3 vs 16.7 %, respectively). In addition, the relapse rate was significantly higher in the mutant patients as compared to those with wild type (62.5 vs 28.2 %, respectively). The AML patients with TERT (A1062T) mutation had shorter overall survival than patients with wild type (P = 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, TERT (A1062T) mutational status is independently worse predictor factor (P = 0.007) when controlling for cytogenetic status (P = <0.001), performance status (P = <0.001) and bone marrow blast cells (P = 0.001). In conclusion, TERT A1062T mutation is an independent negative prognostic factor in AML patients. Therefore, molecular testing for TERT A1062T mutation in patients with AML is recommended in order to delineate their prognostic status.",,"['Aref, Salah', 'El-Ghonemy, Mohamed Sabry', 'Abouzeid, Tarek Elsayed', 'El-Sabbagh, Amr Mohamed', 'El-Baiomy, Mohamed Ali']","['Aref S', 'El-Ghonemy MS', 'Abouzeid TE', 'El-Sabbagh AM', 'El-Baiomy MA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2014/08/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0158-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Sep;31(9):158. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0158-6.

However, the function of HO-1 in the nucleus is not completely clear. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor and master regulator of numerous antioxidants and anti-apoptotic proteins, including HO-1, also accumulates in the nucleus with oxidative injury and in various types of cancer. Here we demonstrate that in oxidative stress, nuclear HO-1 interacts with Nrf2 and stabilizes it from glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)-mediated phosphorylation coupled with ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, thereby prolonging its accumulation in the nucleus. This regulation of Nrf2 post-induction by nuclear HO-1 is important for the preferential transcription of phase II detoxification enzymes such as NQO1 as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), a regulator of the pentose phosphate pathway. Using Nrf2 knock-out cells, we further demonstrate that nuclear HO-1-associated cytoprotection against oxidative stress depends on an HO-1/Nrf2 interaction. Although it is well known that Nrf2 induces HO-1 leading to mitigation of oxidant stress, we propose a novel mechanism by which HO-1, by modulating the activation of Nrf2, sets an adaptive reprogramming that enhances antioxidant defenses.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Biswas, Chhanda', 'Shah, Nidhi', 'Muthu, Manasa', 'La, Ping', 'Fernando, Amal P', 'Sengupta, Shaon', 'Yang, Guang', 'Dennery, Phyllis A']","['Biswas C', 'Shah N', 'Muthu M', 'La P', 'Fernando AP', 'Sengupta S', 'Yang G', 'Dennery PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Nfe2l2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Hmox1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (Nqo1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteolysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Heme Oxygenase', 'Nuclear Factor 2 (Erythroid-derived 2-like Factor) (NFE2L2) (Nrf2)', 'Nuclear Translocation', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein-Protein Interaction']",2014/08/12 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/08/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)37150-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.567685 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 26;289(39):26882-26894. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.567685.

A striking feature of the PIC is its powerful integration activity in vitro. The PICs from a freshly isolated cytoplasmic extract of infected cells are able to insert viral DNA into exogenously added target DNA in vitro. Therefore, a PIC-based in vitro assay is a reliable system for assessing protein factors influencing retroviral integration. In this study, we applied a microtiter plate-based in vitro assay to a screening study using a protein library that was produced by the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. Using a library of human E3 ubiquitin ligases, we identified RFPL3 as a potential stimulator of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) PIC integration activity in vitro. This enhancement of PIC activity by RFPL3 was likely to be attributed to its N-terminal RING domain. To further understand the functional role of RFPL3 in HIV infection, we created a human cell line overexpressing RFPL3. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that RFPL3 was associated with the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 PICs in infected cells. More importantly, single-round HIV-1 infection was enhanced significantly by RFPL3 expression. Our proteomic approach displays an advantage in the identification of new cellular proteins affecting the integration activity of the PIC and, therefore, contributes to the understanding of functional interaction between retroviral integration complexes and host factors.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Tan, Beng Hui', 'Suzuki, Yasutsugu', 'Takahashi, Hirotaka', 'Ying, Pamela Ho Rui', 'Takahashi, Chikako', ""Han, Qi'En"", 'Chin, Wei Xin', 'Chao, Sheng-Hao', 'Sawasaki, Tatsuya', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Suzuki, Youichi']","['Tan BH', 'Suzuki Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Ying PHR', 'Takahashi C', 'Han Q', 'Chin WX', 'Chao SH', 'Sawasaki T', 'Yamamoto N', 'Suzuki Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RFPL3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Titrimetry', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*physiology', 'Virus Integration']",['NOTNLM'],"['E3 Ubiquitin Ligase', 'HIV-1 Protease', 'Host-Pathogen Interaction', 'Microtiter Plate-based Integration Assay', 'Preintegration Complex', 'Protein Screening', 'Recombinant Protein Expression', 'Retrovirus', 'Wheat Germ Cell-free Protein Production System']",2014/08/12 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2014/08/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)48465-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.561662 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 19;289(38):26368-26382. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.561662.

Thus, CDDP resistance often leads to the upregulation of the DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) with the consequent intracellular accumulation of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR)-modified proteins. Here we report another frequent alteration accompanying CDDP resistance, namely upregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein MCL-1. Six out of 8 CDDP resistant cancer cell lines manifested an increase in MCL-1 protein expression level, while only a minority of cell lines overexpressed BCL-2 or BCL-XL. BCL-XL was decreased in six out of 8 cancer cell lines. Importantly, MCL-1 overexpressing, CDDP resistant cells appear to be 'addicted' to MCL-1 because they died upon depletion of MCL-1 by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibition of MCL-1 expression by the BH3 mimetic obatoclax. Knockdown of PARP1 did not succeed in reducing MCL-1 expression, while depletion or inhibition of MCL-1 failed to affect the activity of PARP1. Hence, the two resistance mechanisms are not linked to each other by a direct cause-effect relationship. Importantly, CDDP-resistant, MCL-1 overexpressing human non-small cell lung cancers responded to monotherapy with obatoclax in vivo, in xenotransplanted mice, underscoring the probable therapeutic relevance of these findings.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This has a twofold effect: it causes increased numbers of myeloid progenitor cells and circulating myeloid cells, and it causes leakage of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria. We describe a kinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) model of Bcr-Abl signalling in myeloid cells that is used to simulate effects of four classes of drugs: Bcr-Abl signalling inhibitors, such as imatinib, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and pro- and anti-oxidants. The model also has the potential to describe the PD effects of agents acting on other sites in the Bcr-Abl signalling pathway. Having calibrated the model against dose-response curves of these drugs acting as single agents on Bcr-Abl-transformed cells in vitro, the model was used to predict effects of the agents in combination. Used in conjunction with pharmacokinetic models, our PD model enables an approach to protocol optimization: large numbers of doses and timings and (in the case of combination treatments) relative dose ratios can be simulated in silico. Predicted selectivity, as well as efficacy, can be extracted from the model. An understanding of the Bcr-Abl signalling pathway has implications for strategies to prevent acquired drug resistance, and for preventing or delaying CML progression to its blast phase.",,"['Jackson, Robert C', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas']","['Jackson RC', 'Radivoyevitch T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidants/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pharmacological Phenomena', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/08/10 06:00'],"['2014/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2556-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Oct;74(4):765-76. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2556-z.

However, the cardiotoxicity of long QT syndrome restricts its clinical application. Previous studies showed that As2O3 can damage the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) current via disturbing its trafficking to cellular membrane. This study aimed to investigate whether the As2O3-insulted hERG channel can be rescued by resveratrol, a recognized cardioprotective agent. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record the hERG current and action potential duration. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assay were applied to determine the function of hERG-Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone complexes and the expression alteration of protein-folding-related proteins, respectively. Compared with treatment of As2O3 alone, co-treatment with resveratrol successfully restored the current and surface expression of hERG and obviously shortened action potential duration in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Further experiments demonstrate that resveratrol relieved As2O3-caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by restoring the function of hERG-Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone complexes and downregulating the protein expression of ER chaperone proteins (calnexin and calreticulin) and activating transcription factor 6. In conclusion, resveratrol was able to rescue the trafficking deficiency and relieve the ER stress (ERS).

A preliminary NCI 60-cell screen demonstrated that these compounds display promising anti-tumour activity across a number of different cell types. We have consequently examined the effect of these derivatives in detail on the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) cell line, MV4-11. Cell cycle analyses revealed that the compounds had a range of distinctive cell cycle effects. 7-Hydroxyisoellipticine showed the most promise with respect to cytostatic activity. We demonstrated that this compound inhibited proliferation of leukaemia cells by preventing cells from progressing from G2 phase into mitosis over a period of 24 h at a concentration of 5 muM. Our research suggests that this is mediated by an induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn activates the DNA damage response pathway. As a result of the activation of p53, cyclin B1 is inhibited. The induction of this pathway leads to apoptosis which is seen at 48 h using the same dose of 7-hydroxyisoellipticine.

An increased risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) has also developed. Little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MM treated at our institution from 1993 to 2011 were reviewed. Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with t-MN. Our primary objective was to evaluate the interval to t-MN, response to treatment, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median patient age at the MM diagnosis was 65 years. Of the 47 patients, 32 (68.0%) initially received conventional chemotherapeutic agents, 7 (14.9%), novel agents (eg, lenalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib), and 8 (17.0%), a combination. Twenty patients (42.6%) underwent high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The median interval from the MM diagnosis to t-MN was 7 years (95% CI, 5.0-28.0). Of the 47 patients, 33 (70.2%) developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS), 11 (23.4%) acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), and 3 (6.4%) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (t-CMML). The median age at the t-MN diagnosis was 65 years. Of the 47 patients, 26 (78.8%) with t-MDS, 9 (81.8%) with t-AML, and 1 (33.3%) with t-CMML had complex/high-risk cytogenetics. The median OS for all 47 patients after the t-MN diagnosis was 6.3 months (95% CI, 4.0-8.7). CONCLUSION: The development of t-MN in patients with MM is associated with poor outcomes. These patients, in general, have complex cytogenetic abnormalities and short complete remission and OS times. A better understanding of the disease biology and novel therapeutic approaches are warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The main features are bacterial and fungal infections predominantly in the skin and mucosal surfaces, impaired wound healing and delayed umbilical cord separation. The infections are indolent, necrotic and recurrent. In contrast to the striking difficulties in defense against bacterial and fungal microorganisms, LAD 1 patients do not exhibit susceptibility to viral infections and neoplasias. The severity of clinical manifestations is directly related to the degree of CD18 deficiency. Here, a 20 year-old female presenting a partial CD18 deficiency that developed a megakaryocytic (M7) acute myeloid leukemia is described for the first time. The clinical features of the patient included relapsing oral thrush due to Candida, cutaneous infections and upper and lower respiratory tract infections, followed by a locally severe necrotic genital herpetic lesion. The patient's clinical features improved for a period of approximately two years, followed by severe bacterial infections. At that time, the investigation showed a megakaryocytic acute myeloid leukemia, treated with MEC without clinical improvement.

Autoimmune cytopenia, especially haemolytic anaemia, is common in lymphoproliferative disorders such as chronic lymphoid leukemia. The link between cancer and myositis is well established. Dermatomyositis is associated with an increased relative risk of cancer of 3.4 to 4.4. A combination of detection of antibodies against p155 and TEP-computed tomography may be the best approach to ascertain the presence of occult malignancy in patients with dermatomyositis. A cutaneous or a systemic vascularitis may reveal a cancer, most often a haematological malignancy such as hairy cell leukemia. Paraneoplastic polyarthritis have been described in particular with adenocardinoma of the lungs. Underlying neoplasia should be considered in male smokers patients with new onset polyarthritis and poor health status. The prevalence of autoimmune conditions in myelodysplastic syndromes is 10 to 30%. Vasculitis and relapsing polychondritis are the most commonly reported manifestations. Immune manifestations can also be related to treatment.

The aim of this study is to assess Von Willebrand Factor antigen (VWF antigen) and Factor VIII (FVIII) in newly diagnosed ALL patients, in relation to peripheral blast (PB) cells, steroid therapy, and any prognostic potential. PROCEDURE: VWF antigen and FVIII were assessed initially (D0) and at day 8 (D8) steroid therapy for 32 newly diagnosed ALL patients with and without peripheral blood blast cells. RESULTS: At diagnosis, patients with PBs had a significantly higher levels of VWF antigen (102.7 +/- 22.9% vs. 56.9 +/- 8%, P<0.001) and FVIII (93.4 +/- 15.9% vs. 6 62.6 +/- 18.1%, P<0.001) than those without. Following steroid therapy, both factors decreased in those with PBs, whereas an increase above baseline was observed in those without PBs. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between PBs and both VWF antigen (P<0.001) and FVIII levels (P=0.002). High-risk patients were comparable with standard-risk group in mean values of VWF antigen (P=0.234) and FVIII (P=0.891) at diagnosis. After 12 months from diagnosis, all patients without PB achieved and maintained complete remission. Those with initial PB reported relapse (12.5%) or death (4.2%) during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of endothelial dysfunction namely VWF and FVIII were related to circulating blast cells and steroids therapy through lysis of lymphoblasts results in reduction of both factors, with risk of thrombosis during induction with marked disintegration of malignant cells.",,"['El Sherif, Nayera H K', 'Narouz, Marian F G', 'Elkerdany, Tahany A', 'El Habashy, Safinaz A']","['El Sherif NH', 'Narouz MF', 'Elkerdany TA', 'El Habashy SA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Egypt', 'Factor VIII/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Steroids/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', '*Thrombosis/chemically induced/diagnosis/metabolism', 'von Willebrand Factor/*metabolism']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Oct;36(7):518-23. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000219.,36,10.1097/MPH.0000000000000219 [doi],"[""*Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, Children's Hospital double daggerClinical Pathology Department, Ain Shams University, Nasr City dagger15 May Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis used data from a nonrandomized pediatric study in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Bendamustine 90 or 120 mg/m(2) (60-minute infusion) was administered on days 1 and 2 of 21 day cycles. The population PK base model was adjusted for body surface area (BSA), and the appropriateness of the final model was evaluated by visual predictive check. A covariate analysis explored PK variability. Bayesian PK parameter estimates and concentration-time profiles for each patient were generated. Bendamustine PK in pediatric patients was compared with that of adults with indolent NHL. PK/pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted for fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and infection. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (median age: 7 years; range: 1-19 years) receiving bendamustine 120 mg/m(2) and an additional five patients receiving bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) (median age: 12 years; range: 8-14 years) were included in the population PK analysis. Peak plasma concentrations of bendamustine (Cmax) occurred at the end of infusion (about 1 h). Decline from peak showed a rapid distribution phase (t(1/2)alpha = 0.308 h) and a slower elimination phase (t(1/2)beta = 1.47 h). Model-predicted mean Cmax and area under the curve values from time 0-24 h were 6806 ng/mL and 8240 ng*h/mL, respectively. When dosed based upon BSA, it appeared that age, body weight, race, mild renal (n = 3) or hepatic (n = 2) dysfunction, cancer type, and cytochrome P450 1A2 inhibitors (n = 17) or inducers (n = 3) did not affect systemic exposure, which was comparable between pediatric and adult patients. Infection was the only adverse event associated with bendamustine Cmax. However, due to the small sample size for some subgroups, the observed trends should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: At the recommended dose (120 mg/m(2)), bendamustine systemic exposure was similar across the pediatric population and comparable to adults. The similarity in exposure despite the large range of BSA across pediatric and adult populations confirms the appropriateness of BSA-based dosing, which was utilized to attain systemic exposures in pediatric patients reflective of the therapeutic range in adults. Probability of occurrence of infection increased with higher bendamustine Cmax.",,"['Darwish, Mona', 'Megason, Gail', 'Bond, Mary', 'Hellriegel, Edward', 'Robertson, Philmore Jr', 'Grasela, Thaddeus', 'Phillips, Luann']","['Darwish M', 'Megason G', 'Bond M', 'Hellriegel E', 'Robertson P Jr', 'Grasela T', 'Phillips L']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bendamustine', 'Body surface area', 'Exposure', 'Pediatric', 'Pharmacokinetics']",2014/08/12 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.941976 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2014 Nov;30(11):2305-15. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.941976.

Here, using full-exome or cancer genes-targeted sequencing of 42 ALL samples from 39 DS patients, we uncover driver mutations in RAS, (KRAS and NRAS) recurring to a similar extent (15/42) as JAK2 (12/42) mutations or P2RY8-CRLF2 fusions (14/42). RAS mutations are almost completely mutually exclusive with JAK2 mutations (P=0.016), driving a combined total of two-thirds of analysed cases. Clonal architecture analysis reveals that both RAS and JAK2 drove sub-clonal expansions primarily initiated by CRLF2 rearrangements, and/or mutations in chromatin remodellers and lymphocyte differentiation factors. Remarkably, in 2/3 relapsed cases, there is a switch from a primary JAK2- or PTPN11-mutated sub-clone to a RAS-mutated sub-clone in relapse.

Acute bowel obstruction is its usual clinical presentation. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of small-bowel myeloid sarcoma that occurred in a 64-year-old woman who presented chronic secretory diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, and weight loss. Immature white blood cells in a peripheral smear and small-bowel capsule endoscopic features were the main diagnostic clues. The patient experienced capsule retention and developed acute bowel obstruction. Urgent laparotomy showed a stricturing ileal mass and pathology of the resected bowel specimen unveiled a CD34+, CD117+, and myeloperoxidase-positive myeloid sarcoma. The diarrhoea promptly resolved after surgery, and the patient is now undergoing chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: Secretory diarrhoea can be the first manifestation of small-bowel myeloid sarcoma. Capsule endoscopy may provide a diagnostic clue, but it can trigger an acute bowel obstruction. Differential diagnosis of the pathologic specimen may be difficult and a high suspicion index of is mandatory to perform immunophenotyping to determine the correct management. CONCLUSION: Chronic diarrhoea with alarm features can be the first manifestation of small-bowel myeloid sarcoma.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Unfortunately, few CSC-specific genes have been identified. Here, we determined that the gene encoding arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15/15-LO) is essential for the survival of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in a murine model of BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the absence of Alox15, BCR-ABL was unable to induce CML in mice. Furthermore, Alox15 deletion impaired LSC function by affecting cell division and apoptosis, leading to an eventual depletion of LSCs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of 15-LO function impaired LSC function and attenuated CML in mice. The defective CML phenotype in Alox15-deficient animals was rescued by depleting the gene encoding P-selectin, which is upregulated in Alox15-deficient animals. Both deletion and overexpression of P-selectin affected the survival of LSCs. In human CML cell lines and CD34+ cells, knockdown of Alox15 or inhibition of 15-LO dramatically reduced survival. Loss of Alox15 altered expression of PTEN, PI3K/AKT, and the transcription factor ICSBP, which are known mediators of cancer pathogenesis. These results suggest that ALOX15 has potential as a therapeutic target for eradicating LSCs in CML.",,"['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Peng, Cong', 'Abraham, Sheela A', 'Shan, Yi', 'Guo, Zhiru', 'Desouza, Ngoc', 'Cheloni, Giulia', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Chen Y', 'Peng C', 'Abraham SA', 'Shan Y', 'Guo Z', 'Desouza N', 'Cheloni G', 'Li D', 'Holyoake TL', 'Li S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (6,11-dihydro-5-thia-11-aza-benzo(a)-fluorene)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (P-Selectin)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorenes/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*pathology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'P-Selectin/physiology']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/01/21 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2012/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['66129 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI66129 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Sep;124(9):3847-62. doi: 10.1172/JCI66129.

Bilirubin is a potent endogenous antioxidant, and the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is the main genetic cause of variation in plasma bilirubin in Western Europe. METHODS: In a case-control study of 665 incident cases of ALL in childhood in Denmark 1982-2010 and 1,379 controls, associations between UGT1A1*28 genotypes and ALL in childhood were estimated as odds ratios by logistic regression with adjustment for sex and birth decade. Subgroup analyses were carried out by age at onset in three groups, and on the ALL subtypes precursor B-cell, T-cell, and t(12;21) positive status. Cases were identified in The Danish Registry of Childhood Cancer, and genotypes were estimated from dried blood spots stored in The Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank. Controls were newborns with blood spots taken right before and after a case. RESULTS: We found no association between ALL in childhood and UGT1A1*28 genotypes. The odds ratio was 1.01 (0.88-1.17) for heterozygotes and 1.03 (0.78-1.36) for homozygotes. Also, no associations were found in the subgroup analyses.

Individuals with FA are at high risk of developmental abnormalities, early bone marrow failure and leukemia. These are followed in the second and subsequent decades by a very high risk of carcinomas of the head and neck and anogenital region, and a small continuing risk of leukemia. In order to characterize base pair-level disease-associated (DA) and population genetic variation in FANC genes and the segregation of this variation in the human population, we identified 2948 unique FANC gene variants including 493 FA DA variants across 57,240 potential base pair variation sites in the 16 FANC genes. We then analyzed the segregation of this variation in the 7578 subjects included in the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). There was a remarkably high frequency of FA DA variants in ESP/1KGP subjects: at least 1 FA DA variant was identified in 78.5% (5950 of 7578) individuals included in these two studies. Six widely used functional prediction algorithms correctly identified only a third of the known, DA FANC missense variants. We also identified FA DA variants that may be good candidates for different types of mutation-specific therapies. Our results demonstrate the power of direct DNA sequencing to detect, estimate the frequency of and follow the segregation of deleterious genetic variation in human populations.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone) form a critical component of chemotherapy regimens for pediatric ALL, and the initial response to glucocorticoid therapy is a major prognostic factor, where resistance is predictive of poor outcome. We have previously established a clinically relevant ALL xenograft model, consisting of primary pediatric ALL biopsies engrafted into immune-deficient mice, in which in vitro and in vivo dexamethasone sensitivity significantly correlated with patient outcome. In this study, we used high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify novel compounds that reverse dexamethasone resistance in a xenograft (ALL-19) derived from a chemoresistant pediatric ALL patient that is representative of the most common pediatric ALL subtype (B-cell precursor [BCP-ALL]).

PDC flux depends on catalytic activity of the most important enzyme component pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH kinase inactivates PDC by phosphorylating PDH at specific serine residues, including Ser-293, whereas dephosphorylation of PDH by PDH phosphatase restores PDC activity. The current understanding suggests that Ser-293 phosphorylation of PDH impedes active site accessibility to its substrate pyruvate. Here, we report that phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue Tyr-301 also inhibits PDH alpha 1 (PDHA1) by blocking pyruvate binding through a novel mechanism in addition to Ser-293 phosphorylation. In addition, we found that multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate PDHA1 at Tyr-301, and Tyr-301 phosphorylation of PDHA1 is common in EGF-stimulated cells as well as diverse human cancer cells and primary leukemia cells from human patients. Moreover, expression of a phosphorylation-deficient PDHA1 Y301F mutant in cancer cells resulted in increased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased cell proliferation under hypoxia, and reduced tumor growth in mice. Together, our findings suggest that phosphorylation at distinct serine and tyrosine residues inhibits PDHA1 through distinct mechanisms to impact active site accessibility, which act in concert to regulate PDC activity and promote the Warburg effect.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Fan, Jun', 'Kang, Hee-Bum', 'Shan, Changliang', 'Elf, Shannon', 'Lin, Ruiting', 'Xie, Jianxin', 'Gu, Ting-Lei', 'Aguiar, Mike', 'Lonning, Scott', 'Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Khoury, Hanna J', 'Shin, Dong M', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Boggon, Titus J', 'Kang, Sumin', 'Chen, Jing']","['Fan J', 'Kang HB', 'Shan C', 'Elf S', 'Lin R', 'Xie J', 'Gu TL', 'Aguiar M', 'Lonning S', 'Chung TW', 'Arellano M', 'Khoury HJ', 'Shin DM', 'Khuri FR', 'Boggon TJ', 'Kang S', 'Chen J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', 'EC 1.2.4.1 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide))', 'EC 1.2.4.1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyruvic Acid/chemistry', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell Proliferation', 'Phosphotyrosine Signaling', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC)', 'Tumor Metabolism', 'Warburg Effect']",2014/08/12 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)48480-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.593970 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 19;289(38):26533-26541. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.593970.

The potential effect of ofatumumab on cardiac repolarization and the relationship between ofatumumab concentration and change in corrected QT interval (DeltaQTcF) were evaluated in data from three clinical trials in 82 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receiving ofatumumab alone (n = 14), ofatumumab with chemotherapy (n = 33), and chemotherapy alone (n = 35). Because of ofatumumab accumulation, baseline QTcF interval was recorded prior to the first infusion for each patient. No patient had a post-baseline QTcF interval >480 milliseconds or a DeltaQTcF >60 milliseconds; five patients (four on ofatumumab) had a DeltaQTcF between 30 and 60 milliseconds. At cycle 6 (week 21; 308 mug/mL), there was an increase in QTcF in patients on ofatumumab treatment, with an estimated between-treatment difference (90% CI) of 12.5 (4.5, 20.5) milliseconds. However, at the visit with the highest median concentration (week 8; 1386 mug/mL), median DeltaQTcF was 4.8 milliseconds.

This treatment, however, may adversely influence folliculogenesis and negatively affect oocyte quality through modifications in the follicular concentrations of cytokines released by these immune cells. We studied this hypothesis by systematically analysing the concentrations of cytokines present in the serum and follicular fluid at the time of follicular aspiration in conventional gonadotropin-stimulated (c-IVF) cycles in comparison with natural cycle IVF (NC-IVF) in which the follicles were naturally matured. Our study involved 37 NC-IVF and 39 c-IVF cycles including 13 women who underwent both therapies. Mean age was 35.3 +/- 4.6 (SD) and 34.2 +/- 3.7 years in the NC-IVF and c-IVF groups (ns). Thirteen cytokines were determined in matched serum and FF samples. Interleukin (IL)-4, TNF-alpha, RANTES, eotaxin and interferon-gamma-induced protein-10 concentrations were lower in FF than in serum. IL-6, -8, -10, -18, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), VEGF and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) showed higher median levels in FF than in serum, indicating possible ovarian production. Most of these markers were also increased in concentration in the stimulated (c-IVF) than in the NC groups in the serum, but not in the follicular fluid. This finding can be attributed to the increased number of active follicles present after controlled ovarian stimulation. IL-8 was reduced in c-IVF cycles.

However, little is known regarding the responses by astroglia and microglia to this family of cytokines. Here the expression of the IL-6/gp130 cytokine receptors and subsequent signal pathway activation was examined in murine astrocytes and microglia in vitro. Astrocytes had high levels of OSMR mRNA while lower levels of IL-6R, LIFR and IL-11R mRNAs were also present. In comparison, in microglia there was no detectable OSMR mRNA, higher levels of IL-6R mRNA and lower levels of the LIFR and IL-11R mRNAs. The OSMR protein was present in astrocytes but was undetectable in microglia. Conversely, the IL-6R protein was present in microglia but not detectable in astrocytes. In astrocytes but not microglia, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 occurred in response to OSM, whereas both microglia and astrocytes responded to hyper-IL-6 (IL-6 linked to the soluble IL-6 receptor). Finally, in both microglia and astrocytes, OSM failed to activate NFkappaB or induce iNOS and nitrite production. We conclude: (1) notable differences exist in the expression of receptors utilized by the IL-6/gp130 family of cytokines in astrocytes and microglia, and (2) the findings provide a molecular basis for the differential response to OSM by astrocytes versus microglia and demonstrate a fundamental means for achieving cellular specificity in the response of these glial cells to this cytokine.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hsu, Meng-Ping', 'Frausto, Ricardo', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Campbell, Iain L']","['Hsu MP', 'Frausto R', 'Rose-John S', 'Campbell IL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B-cell differentiation factor receptor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['gp130', 'receptor', 'signal transducers and activators of transcription', 'signal transduction']",2014/08/12 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.22739 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2015 Jan;63(1):132-41. doi: 10.1002/glia.22739.

The most commonly used synthetic GCs in the clinical setting are prednisolone and dexamethasone. While the latter has a higher activity and more effectively reduces the tumor load in patients, it is also accompanied by more serious adverse effects than the former. Whether this difference might be explained by regulation of different genes by the two GCs has never been addressed. RESULTS: Using a recently developed GC bioassay based on a GC-responsive reporter construct in human Jurkat T-ALL cells, we found ~7-fold higher biological activity with dexamethasone than prednisolone. Similarly, 1.0e-7 M dexamethasone and 7.0e-7 M prednisolone triggered similar cell death rates in CCRF-CEM-C7H2 T-chALL cells after 72 hours of treatment. Using microarray-based whole genome expression profiling and a variety of statistical and other approaches, we compared the transcriptional response of chALL cells to 6 hour exposure to both synthetic GCs at the above concentrations. Our experiments did not detect any gene whose regulation by dexamethasone differed significantly from that by prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the reported differences in treatment efficacy and cytotoxicity of dexamethasone and prednisolone are not caused by inherent differences of the 2 drugs to regulate the expression of certain genes, but rather result either from applying them in biologically in-equivalent concentrations and/or from differences in their pharmacokinetics and - dynamics resulting in different bioactivities in tumor cells and normal tissues.",,"['Bindreither, Daniel', 'Ecker, Simone', 'Gschirr, Barbara', 'Kofler, Anita', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Rainer, Johannes']","['Bindreither D', 'Ecker S', 'Gschirr B', 'Kofler A', 'Kofler R', 'Rainer J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/04/01 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-15-662 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-15-662 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2014 Aug 7;15:662. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-662.,15,10.1186/1471-2164-15-662 [doi],"['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Medical University Innsbruck, Innrain 80-82, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria. johannes.rainer@i-med.ac.at.']",PMC4133055,,20140807,,,,,['W 1101/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the study of its characteristics and mechanisms is critical in the search for novel therapeutic approaches to overcome it. This effort is hampered by the absence of appropriate preclinical models, especially those mimicking acquired resistance. Here we present an in vivo model of acquired resistance based on the continuous treatment of mice bearing subcutaneous MM1S plasmacytomas. Xenografts acquired resistance to two generations of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs; lenalidomide and pomalidomide) in combination with dexamethasone, that was reversible after a wash-out period. Furthermore, lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LD) or pomalidomide-dexamethasone (PD) did not display cross-resistance, which could be due to the differential requirements of the key target Cereblon and its substrates Aiolos and Ikaros observed in cells resistant to each combination. Differential gene expression profiles of LD and PD could also explain the absence of cross-resistance. Onset of resistance to both combinations was accompanied by upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway and addition of selumetinib, a small-molecule MEK inhibitor, could resensitize resistant cells. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of acquired resistance to LD and PD combinations and offer possible therapeutic approaches to addressing IMiD resistance in the clinic.",,"['Ocio, E M', 'Fernandez-Lazaro, D', 'San-Segundo, L', 'Lopez-Corral, L', 'Corchete, L A', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Garayoa, M', 'Paino, T', 'Garcia-Gomez, A', 'Delgado, M', 'Montero, J C', 'Diaz-Rodriguez, E', 'Mateos, M V', 'Pandiella, A', 'Couto, S', 'Wang, M', 'Bjorklund, C C', 'San-Miguel, J F']","['Ocio EM', 'Fernandez-Lazaro D', 'San-Segundo L', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Corchete LA', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Garayoa M', 'Paino T', 'Garcia-Gomez A', 'Delgado M', 'Montero JC', 'Diaz-Rodriguez E', 'Mateos MV', 'Pandiella A', 'Couto S', 'Wang M', 'Bjorklund CC', 'San-Miguel JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Crbn protein, mouse)', '0 (Ikzf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Lenalidomide', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmacytoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014238 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.238 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):705-14. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.238.

Myeloma cells closely interact with the BM stroma, which secretes soluble factors that foster myeloma progression and therapy resistance. Growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) is produced by BM-derived stroma cells and can promote malignancy. However, the role of Gas6 and its receptors Axl, Tyro3 and Mer (TAM receptors) in myeloma is unknown. We therefore investigated their expression in myeloma cell lines and in the BM of myeloma patients and healthy donors. Gas6 showed increased expression in sorted BMPCs of myeloma patients compared with healthy controls. The fraction of Mer(+) BMPCs was increased in myeloma patients in comparison with healthy controls whereas Axl and Tyro3 were not expressed by BMPCs in the majority of patients. Downregulation of Gas6 and Mer inhibited the proliferation of different myeloma cell lines, whereas knocking down Axl or Tyro3 had no effect. Inhibition of the Gas6 receptor Mer or therapeutic targeting of Gas6 by warfarin reduced myeloma burden and improved survival in a systemic model of myeloma.

AGM-S3 cells in concert with stem cell factor plus thrombopoietin increased the numbers of peripheral blood CD34(+) cells to approximately 20-fold of the input value after 2 weeks in nine JMML patients with either PTPN11 mutations or RAS mutations, who received allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also augmented the proliferation of JMML CD34(+) cells on AGM-S3 cells. The expansion potential of CD34(+) cells was markedly low in four patients who achieved spontaneous hematological improvement. A large proportion of day-14-cultured CD34(+) cells were negative for CD38 and cryopreservable. Cultured JMML CD34(+)CD38(-) cells expressed CD117, CD116, c-mpl, CD123, CD90, but not CXCR4, and formed GM and erythroid colonies.

Regional differences in prevalence might cause regional differences in physicians' experiences and the efficiency of care-resource use. This study investigated regional differences in the performance of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), outcome and care-resource use in patients with ATL in Japan. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using a Japanese hospital administrative database in 2010, with a diagnostic-procedure combination/per diem payment system. We examined the association between BMT performance, resource use, outcomes and region. RESULTS: We analysed data for 712 subjects of whom 60.5% were Kyushu/Okinawa residents. Significantly more patients with ATL underwent BMT in Kanto (p = 0.018) and Kansai (p < 0.001) regions compared with the Kyushu/Okinawa regions. The lengths of hospital stay were longer in Kanto (p = 0.002) and Kansai (p = 0.006) regions than in the Kyushu/Okinawa region. Total health-care costs were higher in Kanto (p = 0.001) and Kansai (p = 0.005) regions than the Kyushu/Okinawa region. The risks of in hospital mortality were not significantly different between regions. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant regional differences in BMT performance and resource use within Japan. ATL prevalence was not related to the performance of BMTs, resource use or outcomes. Factors related to regional socioeconomics might affect the performance of BMTs and care resource use within Japan.",,"['Maeda, Toshiki', 'Babazono, Akira', 'Nishi, Takumi', 'Matsuda, Shinya', 'Fushimi, Kiyohide', 'Fujimori, Kenji']","['Maeda T', 'Babazono A', 'Nishi T', 'Matsuda S', 'Fushimi K', 'Fujimori K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Health Serv Res,BMC health services research,101088677,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Prevalence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/08/12 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/08/09 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6963-14-337 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6963-14-337 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Health Serv Res. 2014 Aug 8;14:337. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-14-337.,14,10.1186/1472-6963-14-337 [doi],"['Department of Healthcare Administration and Management, Graduate School of Healthcare Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan. toshikimaeda1216@gmail.com.']",PMC4127524,,20140808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fine resolution view of this clonal architecture provides insight into tumor heterogeneity, evolution, and treatment response, all of which may have clinical implications. Single tumor analysis already contributes to understanding these phenomena. However, cryptic subclones are frequently revealed by additional patient samples (e.g., collected at relapse or following treatment), indicating that accurately characterizing a tumor requires analyzing multiple samples from the same patient. To address this need, we present SciClone, a computational method that identifies the number and genetic composition of subclones by analyzing the variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations. We use it to detect subclones in acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer samples that, though present at disease onset, are not evident from a single primary tumor sample.

We show that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) integrates the DNA damage response with DNA metabolism by regulating the salvage of deoxyribonucleosides. Specifically, ATM phosphorylates and activates deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) at serine 74 in response to ionizing radiation (IR). Activation of dCK shifts its substrate specificity toward deoxycytidine, increases intracellular dCTP pools post IR, and enhances the rate of DNA repair. Mutation of a single serine 74 residue has profound effects on murine T and B lymphocyte development, suggesting that post-translational regulation of dCK may be important in maintaining genomic stability during hematopoiesis. Using [(18)F]-FAC, a dCK-specific positron emission tomography (PET) probe, we visualized and quantified dCK activation in tumor xenografts after IR, indicating that dCK activation could serve as a biomarker for ATM function and DNA damage response in vivo.

Six t(8;21) AML patients with c-KIT mutants maintaining > 3 years of complete remission were analyzed. At diagnosis, all single LSCs had both AML1/ETO and c-KIT mutations. However, in remission, 16 out of 1,728 CD34(+)CD38(-) HSCs and 89 out of 7,187 single HSC-derived myeloerythroid colonies from these patients had AML1/ETO, whose breakpoints were identical to those found in LSCs. These cells had wild-type c-KIT, which expressed AML1/ETO at a low level, and could differentiate into mature blood cells, suggesting that they may be the persistent preleukemic stem cells.

The study aim was to determine the antibody response to a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) administered during chemotherapy. METHODS: An open-label study in pediatric leukemia patients: Group 1 had completed a primary 7-valent (PCV7) course and received a single PCV10 dose. Group 2 were PCV immunization naive and received 3 doses of PCV10, administered 2 months apart. Serum samples were taken at baseline and 1 month post each PCV10 dose. Antipneumococcal serotype-specific IgG to 10 serotypes were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the functional response to 4 serotypes (1, 6B, 19F and 23F) was measured using opsonophagocytic assays. RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants were recruited between May 2010 and January 2011; group 1 (n = 27) and group 2 (n = 12). The diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (38) and acute myeloid leukemia (1). Median age was 6.2 years (1.7-17.2 years) with 62% male. The median time from diagnosis to baseline serology was 7.4 months (1.6-36.8 months). At baseline, protective geometric mean concentration above the threshold (>0.35 mug/mL) ranged from 5.3% (serotype 4) to 71% (serotype 19F). More than 60% of participants in both groups were above threshold postimmunization for 7 of the 10 PCV serotypes. Opsonophagocytic assay correlated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 3 of the 4 serotypes and r ranged from 0.51 to 0.84. An injection-site reaction was reported in 73% (27/37). CONCLUSIONS: It is safe to administer PCV10 vaccine during therapy for pediatric leukemia. It provided a satisfactory serum immune response for the majority of vaccine serotypes.",,"['Crawford, Nigel W', 'Balloch, Anne', 'Tikkanen, Leena', 'Merchinaud, Francoise', 'Downie, Peter', 'Buttery, Jim P']","['Crawford NW', 'Balloch A', 'Tikkanen L', 'Merchinaud F', 'Downie P', 'Buttery JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine)', '0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy/*methods', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Opsonin Proteins/blood', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pneumococcal Infections/*prevention & control', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*immunology']",,,2014/08/08 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0000000000000502 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2015 Jan;34(1):e9-15. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000000502.,34,10.1097/INF.0000000000000502 [doi],"[""From the *SAEFVIC, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute; daggerDepartment of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital; double daggerDepartment of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne; section signPneumococcal Laboratory, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute; paragraph signChildren's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital; ||Children's Cancer Centre and **Paediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Monash Children's Hospital, Monash Health; and daggerdaggerDepartment of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of Rituxan(R) (rituximab) and its use in immunochemotherapy regimens has transformed the treatment of CLL and is the current gold standard in physically fit individuals aged < 65 years. Despite this therapeutic development, Rituxan-based immunochemotherapy is limited in the two CLL groups that form the majority of CLL cases-the elderly and patients with comorbidities and high risk factors. Moreover, within 2 years of first- and second-line therapy, around 25% and 50% of patients relapse, respectively, and patients who experience remission for several years exhibit poor responses to subsequent therapies. Therefore, there still remains a significant unmet need in CLL. The rapid development of small-molecule agents targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway has been stimulated both by the association of this pathway with the initiation and progression of CLL as well as the high response rates and durable remissions reported in early-stage trials. Imbruvica (ibrutinib), an oral first-in-class Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, recently entered the market following accelerated approval in the relapsed/refractory setting, but long-term survival data are currently immature. New therapies face several significant challenges: to provide even greater response rates, particularly in the elderly and in patients with comorbidities and high risk factors, and to overcome resistance to current treatments. Currently, the only curative treatment for CLL, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, is not an option for the majority of CLL patients. The ultimate question is whether small-molecule therapeutics can achieve a cure for CLL. It is hoped that developments in identifying the cytogenetic and molecular changes associated with the prognosis and pathogenesis of CLL will enable the rapid development of next-generation targeted therapies.","['Copyright 2014 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

In case of patients' relapse, refractory tumor cells may then be targeted by cellular therapy-based combination strategies. Here, we investigated the potential of small molecule IAP (SMAC mimetic) BV6 in increasing cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity against different tumor targets. Four-hour pre-incubation with 2.5 muMol BV6 moderately enhanced CIK cell-mediated lysis of hematological (H9, THP-1, and Tanoue) and solid malignancies (RH1, RH30, and TE671). However, BV6 also increased apoptosis of non-malignant cells like peripheral blood mononuclear cells and most notably had an inhibitory effect on immune cells potentially limiting their cytotoxic potential. Hence, cytotoxicity increased in a dose-dependent manner when BV6 was removed before CIK cells were added to tumor targets. However, cytotoxic potential was not further increasable by extending BV6 pre-incubation period of target cells from 4 to 12 h. Molecular studies revealed that BV6 sensitization of target cells involved activation of caspases. Here, we provide evidence that SMAC mimetic may sensitize targets cells for CIK cell-induced cell death. However, BV6 also increased apoptosis of non-malignant cells like CIK cells and peripheral mononuclear cells.

Its success is limited by acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a life-threatening complication that occurs when allo-reactive donor T cells attack recipient organs. There is growing evidence that microbes and innate pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLR) and nod-like receptors (NLR) are critically involved in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. Currently, a widely accepted model postulates that intensive chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation during pre-transplant conditioning results in tissue damage and a loss of epithelial barrier function. Subsequent translocation of bacterial components as well as release of endogenous danger molecules stimulate PRRs of host antigen-presenting cells to trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) that modulate T cell allo-reactivity against host tissues, but eventually also the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.

Regarding hematological malignancies, recent novel findings have indicated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which have the potential to self-renew and differentiate into multilineage hematopoietic cells, are an important cellular target for the accumulation of critical somatic mutations and play a central role in myeloid malignancy development. In contrast to myeloid malignancies, mature lymphoid malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), are considered to directly originate from differentiated mature lymphocytes; however, we previously reported that the propensity to generate clonal B cells had already been acquired at the HSC stage in CLL patients. Similarly, HSC involvement has been reported in the pathogenesis of mature T cell lymphomas. These studies indicate that, in mature lymphoid, if not all, malignancies, HSCs should be considered as the critical cellular target in the oncogenic process. The prevalence of these hematological malignancies dramatically increases with age, and the effect of aging HSCs should thus be taken into account when investigating the stepwise malignant transformation process of these age-associated malignancies.",,"['Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro']","['Kikushige Y', 'Miyamoto T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Aging/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2014/08/08 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1651-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Oct;100(4):335-40. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1651-6.

Aside from predisposing to ALL, polymorphisms could also be associated with poor outcome. Indeed, genetic variations involved in drug metabolism could, at least partially, be responsible for heterogeneous responses to standardized leukemia treatments, hence requiring more personalized therapy. The aims of this study were to (a) to determine the prevalence of seven common genetic polymorphisms including those that affect the folate and/or thiopurine metabolic pathways, i.e. cyclin D1 (CCND1-G870A), gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH-C452T), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR-C677T and MTHFR-A1298C), thymidylate synthase promoter (TYMS-TSER), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA-C94A), in Caucasian (n = 94, age < 20) and Vietnamese (n = 141, age < 16 years) childhood ALL and (b) to assess the impact of a multilocus genetic risk score (MGRS) on relapse-free survival (RFS) using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model. RESULTS: The prevalence of MTHFR-677TT genotype was significantly higher in Caucasians (P = 0.008), in contrast to the prevalence of TYMS-TSER*3R/3R and ITPA-94AA/AC genotypes which were significantly higher in Vietnamese (P < 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Compared with children with a low MGRS (</= 3), those with a high MGRS (>/= 4) were 2.06 (95% CI = 1.01, 4.22; P = 0.04) times more likely to relapse. Adding MGRS into a multivariate Cox regression model with race/ethnicity and four clinical variables improved the predictive accuracy of the model (AUC from 0.682 to 0.709 at 24 months). CONCLUSION: Including MGRS into a clinical model improved the predictive accuracy of short and medium term prognosis, hence confirming the association between well determined pharmacogenotypes and outcome of paediatric ALL. Whether variants on other genes associated with folate metabolism can substantially improve the predictive value of current MGRS is not known but deserves further evaluation.",['(c) 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Hoang, Phuong Thu Vu', 'Ambroise, Jerome', 'Dekairelle, Anne-France', 'Durant, Jean-Francois', 'Butoescu, Valentina', 'Chi, Vu Luan Dang', 'Huynh, Nghia', 'Nguyen, Tan Binh', 'Robert, Annie', 'Vermylen, Christiane', 'Gala, Jean-Luc']","['Hoang PT', 'Ambroise J', 'Dekairelle AF', 'Durant JF', 'Butoescu V', 'Chi VL', 'Huynh N', 'Nguyen TB', 'Robert A', 'Vermylen C', 'Gala JL']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Pharmacogenetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Whites/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Caucasian', 'Vietnamese', 'leukemia', 'pharmacogenetics', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms']",2014/08/08 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcp.12481 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Mar;79(3):429-40. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12481.,79,10.1111/bcp.12481 [doi],"[""Centre de Technologies Moleculaires Appliquees (CTMA), Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite catholique de Louvain (UCL), Brussels, Belgium; Service d'hematologie et oncologie pediatrique, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain (UCL), Brussels, Belgium; Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medecin, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam; Blood Transfusion and Hematology Hospital, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.""]",PMC4345953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: With Institutional Review Board approval, a search of the surgical pathology records from 1st January 2000 to 1st July 2012 was performed for haematological malignancies. RESULTS: Forty-eight cases of haematological malignancies (42 women and 6 men) were identified with imaging available for review: 39 cases of breast lymphoma, 6 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 2 cases of acute leukaemia and 1 case of known multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: Breast manifestations of haematological malignancies are rare. They can have a variable appearance at imaging and can mimic primary breast carcinoma. In the setting of suspicious breast imaging findings, pathological diagnosis of haematological malignancy is concordant. Correlation with a clinical history of prior haematological malignancy can be helpful in suggesting the diagnosis and help prevent unnecessary surgical treatment. TEACHING POINTS: * Breast haematological malignancies are rare but the imaging appearances can mimic breast carcinoma. * Breast lymphoma, most often B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, may be primary or due to secondary disease. * At ultrasound, haematological malignancies may present as a heterogeneous or predominantly echogenic mass. * Haematological malignancies show intense activity on PET/CT except myeloma which has low FDG uptake.",,"['Glazebrook, K N', 'Zingula, S', 'Jones, K N', 'Fazzio, R T']","['Glazebrook KN', 'Zingula S', 'Jones KN', 'Fazzio RT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Insights Imaging,Insights into imaging,101532453,,,,,,2014/08/08 06:00,2014/08/08 06:01,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13244-014-0344-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Insights Imaging. 2014 Dec;5(6):715-22. doi: 10.1007/s13244-014-0344-2.

We previously reported that Sp1 is required for the transcriptional activation of the key oncogenes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), including B-lymphoma mouse Moloney leukemia virus insertion region 1 (Bmi1) and centromere protein H (CENPH), but the role of Sp1 and its underlying mechanisms in NPC remained largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the cellular function of Sp1 and to verify the clinical significance of Sp1 as a potential therapeutic target in NPC. METHODS: The levels of Sp1 in the normal primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NPECs) and NPC cell lines were analyzed by Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The location and expression of Sp1 in the NPC tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). The effect of Sp1 knockdown on the cell proliferation, clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth and the stem-cell like phenotype in NPC cells were evaluated by MTT, flow cytometry, clonogenicity analysis and sphere formation assay. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of Sp1 were elevated in NPC cell lines than in the normal primary NPECs. Higher expression of Sp1 was found in NPC tissues with advanced clinical stage (P=0.00036). Either inhibition of Sp1 activity by mithramycin A, the FDA-approved chemotherapeutic anticancer drug or Sp1 silencing by two distinct siRNA against Sp1 suppressed the growth of NPC cells. Mechanism analysis revealed that Sp1 silencing may suppress cell proliferation, clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth and the stem-cell like phenotype through inducing the expression of p27 and p21, and impairing the expressions of the critical stem cell transcription factors (SCTFs), including Bmi1, c-Myc and KLF4 in NPC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Sp1 was enriched in advanced NPC tissues and silencing of Sp1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth and the stem-cell like phenotype of NPC cells, suggesting Sp1 may serve as an appealing drug target for NPC.",,"['Zhang, Jing-Ping', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Wang, Hong-Bo', 'Li, Yan-Xian', 'Liu, Gui-Hong', 'Xing, Shan', 'Li, Man-Zhi', 'Zeng, Mu-Sheng']","['Zhang JP', 'Zhang H', 'Wang HB', 'Li YX', 'Liu GH', 'Xing S', 'Li MZ', 'Zeng MS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', '*Down-Regulation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Spheroids, Cellular/metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2014/08/08 06:00,2015/03/05 06:00,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2014/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['s12967-014-0222-1 [pii]', '10.1186/s12967-014-0222-1 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Aug 7;12:222. doi: 10.1186/s12967-014-0222-1.,12,10.1186/s12967-014-0222-1 [doi],,PMC4132216,,20140807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi provide the sources of ASNase used clinically today. From the time ASNase was first introduced into treatment protocols, the 5-year survival rate has increased significantly, particularly in children and adolescents. E. coli-derived ASNase was approved in 1978 to be used as part of a multiagent chemotherapy to treat ALL. However, the development of hypersensitivity in 10-30% of patients often leads to treatment discontinuation. E. chrysanthemi-derived ASNase (referred to herein as ASNase Erwinia chrysanthemi) is immunologically distinct from E. coli ASNase and therefore does not cross-react with the E. coli enzyme. In 2011, ASNase Erwinia chrysanthemi was approved in the United States for patients who develop hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived ASNase. When indicated, a switch from ASNase E. coli to ASNase E. chrysanthemi allows patients to continue to receive treatment and maintain therapeutic levels of ASNase activity. Therapeutic drug monitoring may help ensure that therapeutic enzyme levels are maintained. Pegylated recombinant ASNase Erwinia chrysanthemi is currently being developed to improve pharmacokinetic properties and reduce immunogenicity.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

The inability of imatinib to cure CML suggests that inactivation of BCR-ABL kinase activity alone is not sufficient to control the disease. Aberrant STAT signaling and constitutive STAT5 or STAT3 activation are frequently found in both acute and chronic leukemia. Constitutive activation of STAT5 and STAT3 are associated with imatinib resistance on leukemia cells. Development of drugs targeting SH2 domains of STAT5 and STAT3 provides a novel strategy for the treatment of the imatinib-resistant CML. Here, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interactions of the drugs targeting STAT3 and STAT5 receptors at molecular level. The calculated binding free energies are consistent with the ranking of the experimental affinities and our simulations also explained their differences in binding energy. Then virtual screening based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics was applied to screen a set of ~1500 compounds for dual inhibitors of the SH2 domains of STAT5 and STAT3. Three top score compounds obtained in virtual screening were compound 660, 304, and 561.

Lupus-prone mice with reduced Fli-1 expression have significantly less nephritis, prolonged survival, and decreased infiltrating inflammatory cells into the kidney. Inflammatory chemokines, including CCL5, are critical for attracting inflammatory cells. In this study, decreased CCL5 mRNA expression was observed in kidneys of lupus-prone NZM2410 mice with reduced Fli-1 expression. CCL5 protein expression was significantly decreased in endothelial cells transfected with Fli-1-specific small interfering RNA compared with controls. Fli-1 binds to endogenous Ets binding sites in the distal region of the CCL5 promoter. Transient transfection assays demonstrate that Fli-1 drives transcription from the CCL5 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Both Ets1, another Ets family member, and Fli-1 drive transcription from the CCL5 promoter, although Fli-1 transactivation was significantly stronger. Ets1 acts as a dominant-negative transcription factor for Fli-1, indicating that they may have at least one DNA binding site in common. Systematic deletion of DNA binding sites demonstrates the importance of the sites located within a 225-bp region of the promoter. Mutation of the Fli-1 DNA binding domain significantly reduces transactivation of the CCL5 promoter by Fli-1. We identified a novel regulator of transcription for CCL5. These results suggest that Fli-1 is a novel and critical regulator of proinflammatory chemokines and affects the pathogenesis of disease through the regulation of factors that recruit inflammatory cells to sites of inflammation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Lennard Richard, Mara L', 'Sato, Shuzo', 'Suzuki, Eiji', 'Williams, Sarah', 'Nowling, Tamara K', 'Zhang, Xian K']","['Lennard Richard ML', 'Sato S', 'Suzuki E', 'Williams S', 'Nowling TK', 'Zhang XK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ccl5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL5/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA/*chemistry/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology', 'Kidney/cytology/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nephritis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Transfection']",,,2014/08/08 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302779 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302779 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Sep 15;193(6):2661-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302779.

We previously reported that FV-induced expansion of this Treg subset was dependent on CD8(+) T cells and TNF-alpha, but independent of IL-2. We now show that the inflammatory milieu associated with FV infection is not necessary for induction of Vbeta5(+) Treg expansion. Rather, it is the presence of activated CD8(+) T cells that is critical for their expansion. The data indicate that the mechanism involves signaling between the membrane-bound form of TNF-alpha on activated CD8(+) T cells and TNFR2 on Tregs. CD8(+) T cells expressing membrane-bound TNF-alpha but no soluble TNF-alpha remained competent to induce strong Vbeta5(+) Treg expansion in vivo. In addition, Vbeta5(+) Tregs expressing only TNFR2 but no TNFR1 were still responsive to expansion. Finally, treatment of naive mice with soluble TNF-alpha did not induce Vbeta5(+) Treg expansion, but treatment with a TNFR2-specific agonist did. These results reveal a new mechanism of intercellular communication between activated CD8(+) T cell effectors and Tregs that results in the activation and expansion of a Treg subset that subsequently suppresses CD8(+) T cell functions.",,"['Joedicke, Jara J', 'Myers, Lara', 'Carmody, Aaron B', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Wajant, Harald', 'Lang, Karl S', 'Lang, Philipp A', 'Mak, Tak W', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Joedicke JJ', 'Myers L', 'Carmody AB', 'Messer RJ', 'Wajant H', 'Lang KS', 'Lang PA', 'Mak TW', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Dittmer U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (T cell receptor peptide Vbeta5.2)', '0 (Tnfrsf1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (iRhom2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/agonists/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",,,2014/08/08 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/08/08 06:00'],"['2014/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1400649 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1400649 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Sep 15;193(6):2952-60. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1400649.

OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to evaluate a qualitative PCR based method for detection of clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement as a marker of minimal residual disease in patients of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the end of induction. METHOD: It was a descriptive study conducted at Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Aug 2009 to Feb 2010. For prospective analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood/bone marrow aspirates and unstained bone marrow smears. A total of 50 patients of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who showed positive immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by qualitative PCR at the time of diagnosis were included. These patients were then investigated for minimal residual disease at the end of induction. PCR amplification of the IgH gene was done by a VH primer homologous with a highly conserved sequence near the 3' end of the FR3 region and a consensus sequence JH primer. Test for minimal residual disease was conducted by PCR amplification of DNA from remission marrow cells (at day 29 of chemotherapy) with the help of the primer sets used at the time of diagnosis. The amplified DNA was seen by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gel. RESULTS: A sharp clonal hand ranging from 90-200 bp indicated a positive reaction. Of 50 patients, 28 (56%) were positive for Ig gene rearrangement on PCR at the end of induction, 17 (34%) patients were found to be negative for minimal residual disease, 2 (4%) patients died during induction therapy, and 3 (6%) patients did not come for follow-up. CONCLUSION: Molecular approaches have allowed us to detect low level of residual disease which is not detected by cytomorphological methods.

Cancer registry is vital for policy making, resource allocation, progress tracking and overall cancer control. In Pakistan, cancer prevention, screening and standardised clinical trials, as well as quality assurance through surveillance are badly hampered due to the lack of a National Cancer Registry. For Pakistan a well-integrated system of Cancer Registry is need of the day. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on the hospital records at the Oncology Department of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad from year 2007-12. Data were collected tIhrough a standard data capture form with a final figure of 555 patients. The malignancies were diagnosed clinically and histopathologically at different laboratories of Pakistan. RESULTS: Among these cases, 54.08% were male and 45.92% female. Incidence of cancer in patients below 14 years age was 8.47% and 91.53% above 14 years. Majority (31.95%) cases were from Mansehra followed by Abbottabad with 27.08% and Haripur 14.26% cases. Leukaemias were at top with 15.14% cases followed by breast carcinoma (13.69%), Lymphomas (12.07%), ovarian carcinomas (8.65%), and gastric carcinoma and skin cancers with 2.70% each. Among men, the highest incidence was of Hodgkin's lymphoma (14.9%) followed by lymphocytic Ieukaemia (14.3%). Prostate cancer was seen in 8.3% male patients. Another 5.7% patients had lung cancer. In women, the highest incidence was carcinoma breast (19.7%) followed by ovarian carcinoma (13.4%), leukaemia (9.7%), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (4.3%).

The purpose of this study was to determine the heterogeneity of BCR-ABL rearrangement in patients with Ph(+)CML in Pakistan. METHODS: The study was conducted at Civil Hospital and Baqai Institute of Hematology (BIH) Karachi. Blood samples from 25 patients with CML were collected. Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to identify various BCR-ABL transcripts. RESULTS: All 25 samples showed BCR-ABL rearrangements. Out of these, 24 (96%) patients expressed p210 BCR-ABL rearrangements i.e. 60% (n=15) had b3a2 and 32% (n=8) had b2a2 rearrangements. Co-expression of b3a2 /b2a2 rearrangement and p190 (e1a3) rearrangement was also identified in two patients. CONCLUSION: It is apparent that majority of the patients had p210 BCR-ABL rearrangements.

Whereas sporadic JMML is known to be aggressive, JMML occurring in patients with NS is often considered as benign and transitory. However, little information is available regarding the occurrence and characteristics of JMML in NS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Within a large prospective cohort of 641 patients with a germline PTPN11 mutation, we identified MPD features in 36 (5.6%) patients, including 20 patients (3%) who fully met the consensus diagnostic criteria for JMML. Sixty percent of the latter (12/20) had severe neonatal manifestations, and 10/20 died in the first month of life. Almost all (11/12) patients with severe neonatal JMML were males. Two females who survived MPD/JMML subsequently developed another malignancy during childhood. Although the risk of developing MPD/JMML could not be fully predicted by the underlying PTPN11 mutation, some germline PTPN11 mutations were preferentially associated with myeloproliferation: 10/48 patients with NS (20.8%) with a mutation in codon Asp61 developed MPD/JMML in infancy. Patients with a p.Thr73Ile mutation also had more chances of developing MPD/JMML but with a milder clinical course. SNP array and whole exome sequencing in paired tumoral and constitutional samples identified no second acquired somatic mutation to explain the occurrence of myeloproliferation. CONCLUSIONS: JMML represents the first cause of death in PTPN11-associated NS. Few patients have been reported so far, suggesting that JMML may sometimes be overlooked due to early death, comorbidities or lack of confirmatory tests.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

There is evidence of eosinophil activation in the intestine during acute inflammatory episodes of these diseases; these episodes are also characterized by an influx of neutrophils, which have the potential to cause extensive tissue damage. We undertook a study to determine whether eosinophils in contact with colonic epithelial cells produce factors that may attract neutrophils in response to immunological stimulation. Neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) and concentrations of three neutrophil-attracting CXC chemokines - CXCL1 (Groalpha), CXCL5 (Ena78) and CXCL8 (IL8) - were measured in supernatants of T84 colonic epithelial cells and blood eosinophils or eosinophil-like myeloid leukaemia cells (AML14.3D10), alone or in combination. Cells were stimulated with serum-opsonized zymosan (OZ) particles. NCA (P<0.005) and CXCL5 levels (P<0.05) in the supernatants of OZ-stimulated epithelial/eosinophil co-cultures were significantly higher than in the supernatants of either cell type alone. Release of CXCL1 (P<0.05) and CXCL8 (P<0.01) from OZ-stimulated co-culture supernatants was significantly higher than from OZ-stimulated eosinophils but not higher than from OZ-stimulated epithelial cells. Eosinophils and colonic epithelial cells exhibit synergy in production of neutrophil chemoattractants in response to immunological stimulation.

METHODS: 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay was adopted to examine cytotoxicity of different treatments. Changes on apoptosis and necrosis rates, DNA fragmentation, intracellular reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular membrane permeability and DOX-uptake were analysed by flow cytometry. Nuclear morphology changes were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Ultrasonic cavitation was measured by spectrofluorimetry. RESULTS: Under optimal conditions, MB-US significantly aggravated DOX-induced K562 cell death, especially necrosis, when compared with either monotherapy. Synergistic potentiation on DNA damage, ROS generation and MMP loss were observed. Ultrasonic cavitation effects, plasma membrane permeabilization and DOX-uptake were notably improved after MB-US exposure. CONCLUSIONS: MB-US could increase the susceptibility of tumours to antineoplastic drugs, suggesting a potential clinical method for US-mediated tumour chemotherapy. KEY POINTS: * Microbubble-ultrasound (MB-US) aggravated doxorubicin (DOX) induced K562 cell death, especially necrosis * MB-US synergistically potentiated DOX-initiated DNA damage, ROS generation and MMP loss * Ultrasonic cavitation effects, plasma membrane permeabilization and DOX-uptake were improved after treatment * MB-US holds significant potential for improving the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy.",,"['Yang, Shuang', 'Wang, Pan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Su, Xiaomin', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Yang S', 'Wang P', 'Wang X', 'Su X', 'Liu Q']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur Radiol,European radiology,9114774,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Contrast Media', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', '*Microbubbles', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Ultrasonic Therapy/*methods']",,,2014/08/07 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/08/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00330-014-3334-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Radiol. 2014 Nov;24(11):2739-53. doi: 10.1007/s00330-014-3334-3.

EPR measurements showed that superoxide radical anion and singlet oxygen were produced upon irradiation of AcrDIMs with UV-A light (>300nm) in the presence of molecular oxygen. This indicates that AcrDIMs may act as photosensitizers. The most active pentyl-AcrDIM and hexyl-AcrDIM displayed photocytotoxic effect toward the mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210 and human ovarian cancer cells A2780. Antitumor activity of pentyl-AcrDIM increased as high as about 12 times (72h incubation) after irradiation of A2780 cells (365nm, 1.05J/cm(2)). The photocytotoxicity seems to be associated with oxidative stress. Concerning the cell cycle, flow cytometry showed an arrest in the S-phase already 4h after irradiation. In a comet assay, no genotoxicity of AcrDIMs was found. Typical morphologic changes and formation of DNA-ladders indicated induction of apoptotic cell death, though no activation of caspase-3 was observed. Investigation of intracellular localization of pentyl-AcrDIM confirmed its partial accumulation in mitochondria and lysosomes. After irradiation of the A2780 cells, colocalization of pentyl-AcrDIM with monodansylcadaverine, a lysosomal dye, was proven, suggesting that lysosomes in the irradiated cells may be involved in the cell death.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This may reflect different disease-related and patient-related factors. The purpose of this analysis is to identify disease-specific prognostic factors and to develop prognostic scores for both patient groups. A total of 692 patients in the EORTC/GIMEMA AML-10 study and 289 patients in the CRIANT study received identical remission-induction and consolidation treatment. Estimated 5-year survival rate was 34 % in the AML-10 versus 27 % in the CRIANT study, and estimated disease-free survival was 40 % versus 28 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, cytogenetic characteristics, white blood count, and age appeared prognostic for survival in both studies. French-American-British (FAB) subtype and performance status were prognostic in the AML-10 study only, whereas number of cytopenias and duration of antecedent hematologic disorder >6 months were prognostic in the CRIANT study only.

Only a few and small cohorts of chronic NK LPD have been published. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report here clinicobiological features collected retrospectively from 70 cases of chronic NK LPD, and compared with those of T-LGL leukemia. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between chronic NK LPD and T-LGL leukemia concerning median age [61 years (range 23-82 years)], organomegaly (26%), associated autoimmune diseases (24%), and associated hematological malignancies (11%). Patients with chronic NK LPD were significantly less symptomatic (49% versus 18%, P < 0.001) and the association with rheumatoid arthritis was more rarely observed (7% versus 17%, P = 0.03). The neutropenia (<0.5 x 10(9)/l) was less severe in chronic NK LPD (33% versus 61%, P < 0.001) without difference in the rate of recurrent infections. STAT3 mutation was detected in 12% of the cohort, which is lower than the frequency observed in T-LGL leukemia. Thirty-seven percent of the patients required specific therapy. Good results were obtained with cyclophosphamide. Overall and complete response rates were, respectively, 69% and 56%. Overall survival was 94% at 5 years. CONCLUSION: This study suggests very high similarities between chronic NK LPD and T-LGL leukemias. Since chronic NK LPD is still a provisional entity, our findings should be helpful when considering further revisions of the WHO classification.","['(c) The Author 2014.

There is tremendous interest to understand how the proapoptotic BCL-2 effector members (e.g. BCL-2-associated X protein, BAX) cooperate with the BCL-2 homology domain only (BH3-only) subclass (e.g. BCL-2 interacting mediator of death, BIM; BCL-2 interacting-domain death agonist, BID) to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis and whether these mechanisms may be pharmacologically exploited to enhance the killing of cancer cells. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members have been designed rationally. However, the success of these ""BH3 mimetics"" in the clinic has been limited, likely due to an incomplete understanding of how these drugs function in the presence of multiple BCL-2 family members. To increase our mechanistic understanding of how BH3 mimetics cooperate with multiple BCL-2 family members in vitro, we directly compared the activity of several BH3-mimetic compounds (i.e. ABT-263, ABT-737, GX15-070, HA14.1, TW-37) in biochemically defined large unilamellar vesicle model systems that faithfully recapitulate BAX-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Our investigations revealed that the presence of BAX, BID, and BIM differentially regulated the ability of BH3 mimetics to derepress proapoptotic molecules from anti-apoptotic proteins. Using mitochondria loaded with fluorescent BH3 peptides and cells treated with inducers of cell death, these differences were supported. Together, these data suggest that although the presence of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins primarily dictates cellular sensitivity to BH3 mimetics, additional specificity is conferred by proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Renault, Thibaud T', 'Elkholi, Rana', 'Bharti, Archana', 'Chipuk, Jerry E']","['Renault TT', 'Elkholi R', 'Bharti A', 'Chipuk JE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TW-37 compound)', '0 (Unilamellar Liposomes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/chemistry/*physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Benzopyrans/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/physiology', 'Nitriles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Nitrophenols/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Unilamellar Liposomes/chemistry', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/chemistry/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/chemistry/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer Drug', 'Apoptosis', 'BH3 Mimetics', 'Bax', 'Bcl-2 Proteins', 'MOMP', 'Mitochondria']",2014/08/07 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2014/08/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)48475-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.569632 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 19;289(38):26481-26491. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.569632.

SST0116CL1 binds to the ATP binding pocket of Hsp90, and interferes with Hsp90 chaperone function thus resulting in client protein degradation and tumor growth inhibition. The aim of the study was to assess SST0116CL1 in various solid and haematological tumors. The antitumor properties of SST0116CL1 were assessed using in vitro cell proliferation and client protein degradation assays and in vivo different tumor xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were also generated in tumor-bearing mice to gain an understanding of optimal dosing schedules and regimens. SST0116CL1 was shown to inhibit recombinant Hsp90alpha and to induce the destabilization of different client proteins, often overexpressed and constitutively activated in different types of hematological or solid human tumors. In preclinical in vivo studies, it was revealed to induce antitumor effects in murine models of leukemia and of gastric and ovarian carcinoma. A modulation of PD biomarkers in terms of downregulation of Hsp90 client proteins in tumor-bearing mice was found. SST0116CL1 is a new clinical candidate for cancer therapy.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for associations between birth weight and: (1) all cancer sites combined, (2) gynecologic cancers, and (3) several site-specific cancer sites. RESULTS: After adjustments, birth weight was positively associated with the risk of lung cancer (p=0.01), and colon cancer (p=0.04). An inverse trend was observed between birth weight and risk for leukemia (p=0.04). A significant trend was not observed with breast cancer risk (p=0.67); however, women born weighing >/=10 lbs were less likely to develop breast cancer compared to women born between 6 lbs-7 lbs 15 oz (aHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63, 0.94).

We propose a new SV system identification method to estimate all underlying key system parameters for the Probit model and compare it with the LG model in the setting of genetic association studies. Across an extensive series of simulation studies, the Probit method maintained type I error control and had similar or greater power than the LG method, which is robust to different distributions of noise: logistic, normal, or t distributions. Additionally, the Probit association parameter estimate was 2.7-46.8-fold less variable than the LG log-odds ratio association parameter estimate. Less variability in the association parameter estimate translates to greater power and robustness across the spectrum of minor allele frequencies (MAFs), and these advantages are the most pronounced for rare variants. For instance, in a simulation that generated data from an additive logistic model with an odds ratio of 7.4 for a rare single nucleotide polymorphism with a MAF of 0.005 and a sample size of 2,300, the Probit method had 60% power whereas the LG method had 25% power at the alpha = 10(-6) level. Consistent with these simulation results, the set of variants identified by the LG method was a subset of those identified by the Probit method in two example analyses. Thus, we suggest the Probit method may be a competitive alternative to the LG method in genetic association studies such as candidate gene, genome-wide, or next-generation sequencing studies for a binary phenotype.",,"['Kang, Guolian', 'Bi, Wenjian', 'Zhao, Yanlong', 'Zhang, Ji-Feng', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Xu, Heng', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Cheng, Cheng']","['Kang G', 'Bi W', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang JF', 'Yang JJ', 'Xu H', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP', 'Relling MV', 'Pounds S', 'Cheng C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Hum Hered,Human heredity,0200525,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Exome', 'Genetic Association Studies/*statistics & numerical data', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', '*Models, Statistical', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Regression Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,,2014/08/07 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/08/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['000363660 [pii]', '10.1159/000363660 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Hered. 2014;78(2):104-16. doi: 10.1159/000363660.

It has often been defined as a functionally pleiotropic molecule because it can simultaneously target multiple pathways bypassing or ameliorating the onset of drug resistance in malignant cells. In this context, we reviewed the sometimes paradoxical antioxidant properties of quercetin and the functional role of its glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates to discuss the low bioavailability of the molecule measured in vivo. We recently demonstrated that quercetin is able to sensitize several leukemia cell lines as well as B cells isolated from patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to death ligand agonists (anti-CD95 and rTRAIL). The flavonol also potentiates the effect of canonical and innovative chemotherapeutic drugs (fludarabine and ABT-737) against CLL. The apoptosis-enhancing activity of quercetin in cell lines and B-CLL cells depends upon the modulated expression and activity of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family. Herein, we suggest that the pleotropic activity of quercetin in CLL is obtained by the direct inhibition of key protein kinases, which positively regulate Mcl-1 activity and by indirect downregulation of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels acting on its mRNA stability and proteasome-mediated degradation.

HMGB3 is also expressed at a high level in the progression phase of breast and gastric cancer (GC). Using bioinformatic analyses, we found that HMGB3 is a potential target for miR-513b. However, the pathophysiological role of miR-513b and its relevance to the growth and development of GC have yet to be investigated. This study focuses on whether miR-513b acts as a tumor suppressor in GC. Compared with non-malignant adjacent tissues samples, qRT-PCR data showed significant downregulation of miR-513b in 74 GC tissue samples (P < 0.01). Furthermore, western blotting revealed that HMGB3 protein was overexpressed in tumor samples relative to matched, non-malignant adjacent tissues. Western blotting and qRT-PCR results showed that high expression of HMGB3 and low expression of miR-513b were both significantly associated with primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and the clinical stage (P < 0.01). MiR-513b was shown to not only inhibit the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells (MKN45 and SGC7901) in the CCK-8 and transwell assays, but also to promote cell apoptosis in a flow-cytometric apoptosis assay. In western blot and luciferase assays, HMGB3 was identified as a major target of miR-513b. Moreover, we also found that the expression of HMGB3 lacking in 3' UTR could abrogate the anti-migration and pro-apoptosis function of miR-513b. These findings suggest the importance of miR-513b targeting of HMGB3 in the regulation of growth, migration and apoptosis of GC, improve our understanding of the mechanisms of GC pathogenesis, and may promote the development of novel targeted therapies.",,"['Chen, Xudong', 'Zhao, Guoqiang', 'Wang, Fuqing', 'Gao, Fenglan', 'Luo, Hailan', 'Wang, Yuanyuan', 'Du, Yuwen', 'Chen, Xiaonan', 'Xue, Changgui', 'Dong, Ziming', 'Song, Guohua']","['Chen X', 'Zhao G', 'Wang F', 'Gao F', 'Luo H', 'Wang Y', 'Du Y', 'Chen X', 'Xue C', 'Dong Z', 'Song G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (HMGB3 Protein)', '0 (MIRN513 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HMGB3 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/08/07 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/08/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2405-z [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Nov;35(11):11081-9. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2405-z.

The role of the microenvironment within which cancer cells evolve and which mediates this effect is far from clear. Here, the involvement of IGF-I in inducing multidrug resistance in a myeloid leukemia cell line, grown in the presence of bone marrow-derived stromal cells called 'Hospicells' (BMH), is demonstrated. We found that i) drug sensitive as well as resistant leukemia cells express IGF-I and its receptor IGF-IR. However, the resistant cells were found to secrete high levels of IGF-I. ii) Presence of exogenous IGF-I promoted cell proliferation, which decreased when an inhibitor of IGF-IR (picropodophyllin, PPP) was added. iii) BMH and IGF-I are both involved in the regulation of genes of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) related to resistance development (MDR1, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3 and BCRP). iv) The levels of ABC gene expression by leukemia cells were found to increase in the presence of increasing numbers of BMH. However, these levels decreased when IGF-IR was inhibited by addition of PPP. v) Co-culture of the drug-sensitive leukemia cells with BMH induced protection against the action of daunorubicin.

HSC transplantation offers a potentially curative treatment for a number of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies as well as immune and genetic disorders. Limited availability of immune-matched donors reduces the viable options for many patients in need of HSC transplantation, particularly those of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Due to rapid availability and less stringent immune-matching requirements, umbilical cord blood (UCB) has emerged as a valuable source of transplantable HSCs. A single UCB unit contains a suboptimal number of HSCs for treating larger children or adults and there has thus been great clinical interest in expanding UCB HSCs ex vivo for use in transplantation.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is required for detoxification, through S-methylation, of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), a byproduct of thiopurine metabolism. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TPMT gene have been shown to affect its function, with some variants associated with serious clinical manifestations including severe to fatal myelosuppression and organ transplant rejection following treatment with standard thiopurine doses. In this study, we describe a TaqMan real time PCR allelic discrimination assay requiring minimal DNA input for TPMT genotyping. DESIGN AND METHODS: We designed controls for the homozygous wild type and allelic variants of TPMT*2, *3B, and *3C. Genomic DNA was extracted from an additional 412 human blood samples. The samples were tested for the TPMT*2, *3B, *3C, and *3A polymorphisms by TaqMan genotyping assays using the AB 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR instrument. Allelic discrimination plots were used to identify each mutation. RESULTS: The TaqMan assay correctly genotyped all custom control DNA samples. Of the 412 tested samples, our assay identified 375 samples as wild-type *1/*1 (91.02%), 3 as *1/*2 (0.73%), 1 as *1/*3B (0.24%), 3 as *1/*3C (0.73%), 27 presumed to be *1/*3A (6.55%), and 3 as *3B/*3A (0.73%). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical implications of TPMT genotyping, along with the simplicity and specificity of the TaqMan genotyping assays make this test highly suitable for use in a clinical laboratory.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Whereas a range of DNA-damage responses have been characterized, mechanisms underlying subsequent cell-fate decision remain elusive. Here we exposed cultured cells and mice to different doses and dose rates of gamma-irradiation, which revealed cell-type-specific sensitivities to chronic, but not acute, gamma-irradiation. Among tested cell types, human fibroblasts were associated with the highest levels of growth inhibition in response to chronic gamma-irradiation. In this context, fibroblasts exhibited a reversible G1 cell-cycle arrest or an irreversible senescence-like growth arrest, depending on the irradiation dose rate or the rate of DNA damage. Remarkably, when the same dose of gamma-irradiation was delivered chronically or acutely, chronic delivery induced considerably more cellular senescence. A similar effect was observed with primary cells isolated from irradiated mice. We demonstrate a critical role for the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/tumor protein p53 (TP53)/p21 pathway in regulating DNA-damage-associated cell fate. Indeed, blocking the ATM/TP53/p21 pathway deregulated DNA damage responses, leading to micronucleus formation in chronically irradiated cells.

AML patients' plasma collected at diagnosis contains elevated exosome levels relative to normal donor (ND) plasma. The molecular profile of AML exosomes changes in the course of therapy and may serve as a measure of disease progression or response to therapy. However, plasma contains a mix of exosomes derived from various cell types. To be able to utilize blast-derived exosomes as biomarkers for AML, we have developed an immunoaffinity-based capture method utilizing magnetic microbeads coated with anti-CD34 antibody (Ab). This Ab is specific for CD34, a unique marker of AML blasts. The capture procedure was developed using CD34+ exosomes derived from Kasumi-1 AML cell culture supernatants. The capture capacity of CD34microbeads was shown to linearly correlate with the input exosomes. A 10 uL aliquot of CD34 microbeads was able to capture all of CD34+ exosomes present in 100-1,000 uL of AML plasma. The levels of immunocaptured CD34+ exosomes correlated with the percentages of CD34+ blasts in the AML patients' peripheral blood. The immunocaptured exosomes had a typical cup-shaped morphology by transmission electron microscopy, and their molecular cargo was similar to that of parental blasts. These exosomes were biologically-active. Upon co-incubation with natural killer (NK) cells, captured blast-derived exosomes down-regulated surface NKG2D expression, while non-captured exosomes reduced expression levels of NKp46. Our data provide a proof-of-principle that blast-derived exosomes can be quantitatively recovered from AML patients' plasma, their molecular profile recapitulates that of autologous blasts and they retain the ability to mediate immune suppression. These data suggest that immunocaptured blast-derived exosomes might be useful in diagnosis and/or prognosis of AML in the future.",,"['Hong, Chang Sook', 'Muller, Laurent', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Whiteside, Theresa L']","['Hong CS', 'Muller L', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Whiteside TL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Platelets/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Fractionation/methods', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/pathology', 'Exosomes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/chemistry/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultracentrifugation']",,,2014/08/06 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/08/06 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0103310 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-18511 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 5;9(8):e103310. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0103310. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0103310 [doi],"['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America; University Hospital, Department of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Basel, Switzerland.', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America; University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America; University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Departments of Pathology, Immunology and Otolaryngology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",PMC4122364,,20140805,,,,,"['UL1 TR000005/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA168628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA168628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we will discuss the data on the use of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor Idelalisib in the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The preclinical and clinical data thus far demonstrate that Idelalisib produces a dramatic and durable response in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and without causing significant toxicity. Moving forward, the ongoing clinical trials will help address the various questions currently being raised regarding the long-term application and safety of Idelalisib. With greater clinical experience following more widespread use of Idelalisib, we will be able to determine the optimal combination therapies in treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory patients, resulting in more individualized therapeutic strategies for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,"['Khan, Maliha', 'Saif, Areeba', 'Sandler, Steven', 'Mirrakhimov, Aibek E']","['Khan M', 'Saif A', 'Sandler S', 'Mirrakhimov AE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Egypt,ISRN Oncol,ISRN oncology,101567026,,,,,,2014/08/06 06:00,2014/08/06 06:01,['2014/08/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/931858 [doi]'],epublish,ISRN Oncol. 2014 Apr 1;2014:931858. doi: 10.1155/2014/931858. eCollection 2014.,2014,10.1155/2014/931858 [doi],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Saint Joseph Hospital, 2900 N.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, IGF1R is one of the most abundantly phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases, promoting cell growth through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF1R gene dysregulation in cancer. We discovered a novel intragenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) within the IGF1R locus, named IRAIN, which is transcribed in an antisense direction from an intronic promoter. The IRAIN lncRNA was expressed exclusively from the paternal allele, with the maternal counterpart being silenced. Using both reverse transcription-associated trap and chromatin conformation capture assays, we demonstrate that this lncRNA interacts with chromatin DNA and is involved in the formation of an intrachromosomal enhancer/promoter loop. Knockdown of IRAIN lncRNA with shRNA abolishes this intrachromosomal interaction. In addition, IRAIN was downregulated both in leukemia cell lines and in blood obtained from high-risk AML patients. These data identify IRAIN as a new imprinted lncRNA that is involved in long-range DNA interactions.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014.

Our primary objective was to determine whether adding GO to standard chemotherapy improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in children with newly diagnosed AML. Our secondary objectives examined outcomes by risk group and method of intensification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children, adolescents, and young adults ages 0 to 29 years with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled onto Children's Oncology Group trial AAML0531 and then were randomly assigned to either standard five-course chemotherapy alone or to the same chemotherapy with two doses of GO (3 mg/m2/dose) administered once in induction course 1 and once in intensification course 2 (two of three). RESULTS: There were 1,022 evaluable patients enrolled. GO significantly improved EFS (3 years: 53.1% v. 46.9%; hazard ratio [HzR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99; P.04) but not OS (3 years: 69.4% v. 65.4%; HzR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P = .39). Although remission was not improved (88% v. 85%; P = .15), posthoc analyses found relapse risk (RR) was significantly reduced among GO recipients overall (3 years: 32.8% v. 41.3%; HzR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.91; P = .006). Despite an increased postremission toxic mortality (3 years: 6.6% v. 4.1%; HzR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.93 to 3.08; P = .09), disease-free survival was better among GO recipients (3 years: 60.6% v. 54.7%; HzR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.02; P = .07).

While many efforts to confirm this observation failed, one report detected polytropic murine leukemia virus (pMLV), instead of XMRV. In both studies, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based methods were employed which could provide the basis for the development of a practical diagnostic tool. To confirm these studies, we hypothesized that the ability to detect these viruses will not only depend upon the technical details of the methods employed but also on the criteria used to diagnose CFS and the availability of well characterized clinical isolates. METHODS: A repository of clinical isolates from geographically distinct sites was generated by the collection of fresh blood samples from well characterized CFS and healthy subjects. Molecular techniques were used to generate assay positive controls and to determine the lower limit of detection (LLOD) for murine retroviral and Intracisternal A particle (Cell 12(4):963-72, 1977) detection methods. RESULTS: We report the establishment of a repository of well-defined, clinical isolates from five, geographically distinct regions of the US, the comparative determination of the LLODs and validation efforts for the previously reported detection methods and the results of an effort to confirm the association of these retroviral signatures in isolates from individuals with CFS in a blinded, multi-site, prospective study. We detected various, murine retroviral DNA signatures but were unable to resolve a difference in the incidence of their detection between isolates from CFS (5/72; 6.7%) and healthy (2/37; 5.4%) subjects (Fisher's Exact Test, p-value = 1). The observed sequences appeared to reflect the detection of endogenous murine retroviral DNA, which was not identical to either XMRV or pMLV. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to confirm a previously reported association between the detection of XMRV or pMLV sequences and CFS in a prospective, multi-site study. Murine retroviral sequences were detected at a low frequency that did not differ between CFS and control subjects.

Using this more potent isoform, we show that mPR promotes immortalization by preventing cellular senescence, impeding up-regulation of both the p21 and p19(ARF) cell-cycle regulators.

Patients with FLT3-ITD mutations tend to have a poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a pivotal role in myeloid differentiation and leukemia. MiRNA-155 (MiR-155) was found to be upregulated in FLT3-ITD-associated AMLs. In this study, we discovered that FLT3-ITD signaling induces the oncogenic miR-155. We show in vitro and in vivo that miR-155 expression is regulated by FLT3-ITD downstream targets nuclear factor-kappaB (p65) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5).

We determined the prognostic impact of comorbidity and World Health Organization Performance Status (PS) on achievement of complete remission and mortality in all Danish AML patients treated between 2000 and 2012 overall and stratified by age. Comorbidity was measured using a modified version of the Charlson Comorbidity Index, with separate adjustment for pre-leukemic conditions. Of 2792 patients, 1467 (52.5%) were allocated to intensive therapy. Of these patients, 76% did not have any comorbidities, 19% had one comorbid disease and 6% had two or more comorbidities. Low complete remission rates were associated with poor PS but not with comorbidity. Surprisingly, among all intensive therapy patients, presence of comorbidity was not associated with an increased short-term mortality (adjusted 90 day mortality rate (MR)=1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.76-1.48)) and, if any, only a slight increase in long-term mortality (91 day-3 year adjusted MR=1.18 (95%CI=0.97-1.44).

In our previous study, we found that area-based standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of some diseases were elevated shortly after the incident. This previous study, however, was unable to determine whether these elevated SMRs were a result of other area-specific factors. To overcome this limitation, we obtained mortality data from the 5 years before the incident and conducted an area-based study using vital statistics records dating from 1963 to 2002. METHODS: The population of Nagasaki Prefecture was set as the reference population for calculating SMRs. We also included data on cause-specific mortality attributable to cancer and expanded the population to encompass two severely exposed areas where contaminated rice oil was distributed (namely Tamanoura and Naru). We also calculated SMRs in the remainder of the Shimo-Goto region, excluding the exposed area, which was used as a comparison area. RESULTS: Even after considering the time trends in mortality before the incident, mortality due to diabetes mellitus and heart disease, as well as all-cause mortality, was found to be elevated shortly afterward. Additionally, mortalities due to uterine cancer in Tamanoura and leukemia were also elevated at 30-34 and 10-59 years after the event in both exposed areas, respectively. SMRs for leukemia in Tamanoura were as high as 3.0 (95% confidence interval 1.4-6.2) and 2.4 (1.2-4.8) 10-19 years later. In this period, SMRs for leukemia in the comparison area were not elevated.

It is well known that Mcl-1 can interact with certain pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in normal cells to neutralize their pro-apoptotic functions, thus prevent apoptosis. In addition, it was recently found that Mcl-1 can also inhibit mitochondrial calcium uptake. The detailed mechanism, however, is still not clear. Based on Yeast Two-Hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified a mitochondrial protein p32 (C1qbp) as a novel binding partner of Mcl-1. We found that p32 had a number of interesting properties: (1) p32 can positively regulate UV-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. (2) Over-expressing p32 could significantly promote mitochondrial calcium uptake, while silencing p32 by siRNA suppressed it. (3) In p32 knockdown cells, Ruthenium Red treatment (an inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uniporter) showed no further suppressive effect on mitochondrial calcium uptake. In addition, in Ruthenium Red treated cells, Mcl-1 also failed to suppress mitochondrial calcium uptake. Taken together, our findings suggest that p32 is part of the putative mitochondrial uniporter that facilitates mitochondrial calcium uptake. By binding to p32, Mcl-1 can interfere with the uniporter function, thus inhibit the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uploading. This may provide a novel mechanism to explain the anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Proteomic research in pediatrics is important and most of the successes thus far are seen in research that utilize samples that require less invasive procedures and focus on prevailing childhood diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and neuroblastoma. Recent advances in proteomics are helping to elucidate platelet processes that are relevant to bleeding and clotting disorders, as well as other important roles of platelets such as in angiogenesis and inflammation. Nevertheless, most of platelet proteome data obtained to date are derived from the adult population and the potential of platelet proteomic application in children has not yet been explored. As it happens in all research fields, there are additional challenges in studying children such as procuring sufficient biological samples and access to less common disease cohorts as compared to in adults. Furthermore, many of the prevalent platelet-mediated diseases in adults, such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerotic lesions, are believed to have origins during childhood. Hence, platelet proteomic research in children may reveal some important information on how platelet plays a role in the pathogenesis of disease.

We aimed to validate the prognostic significance of MSI2 in ALL. METHODS: MSI2 expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 140 adult B-ALL patients and compared to controls. RESULTS: MSI2 expression level in patients was significantly higher when compared to the control group (P = 0.001). High MSI2 expression did not correlate with the clinical characteristics of patients. However, patients with high MSI2 expression had significantly lower incidence of complete remission (CR) (P = 0.03), inferior overall survival (P = 0.018), and shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high MSI2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for adult BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL patients.

A common germline deletion in the BIM gene was recently shown to favor the production of non-apoptotic BIM isoforms, and to predict inferior responses in TKI-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and EGFR-driven lung cancer patients. Given that both in vitro and in vivo GC resistance are predictive of adverse outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we hypothesized that this polymorphism would mediate GC resistance, and serve as a biomarker of poor response in ALL. Accordingly, we used zinc finger nucleases to generate ALL cell lines with the BIM deletion, and confirmed the ability of the deletion to mediate GC resistance in vitro. In contrast to CML and lung cancer, the BIM deletion did not predict for poorer clinical outcome in a retrospective analysis of 411 pediatric ALL patients who were uniformly treated with GCs and chemotherapy. Underlying the lack of prognostic significance, we found that the chemotherapy agents used in our cohort (vincristine, L-asparaginase, and methotrexate) were each able to induce ALL cell death in a BIM-independent fashion, and resensitize BIM deletion-containing cells to GCs. Together, our work demonstrates how effective therapy can overcome intrinsic resistance in ALL patients, and suggests the potential of using combinations of drugs that work via divergent mechanisms of cell killing to surmount BIM deletion-mediated drug resistance in other cancers.",,"['Soh, Sheila Xinxuan', 'Lim, Joshua Yew Suang', 'Huang, John W J', 'Jiang, Nan', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng Juh', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Soh SX', 'Lim JY', 'Huang JW', 'Jiang N', 'Yeoh AE', 'Ong ST']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Deficiency']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*deficiency/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2014/08/05 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2014/08/05 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0103435 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-12777 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Aug 4;9(8):e103435. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0103435. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0103435 [doi],"['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', ""Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore; Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, University Children's Medical Institute, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore; Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore."", 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore, Singapore; Division of Medical Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.']",PMC4121131,,20140804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pgp is an efflux pump capable of activating the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. The gene encoding Pgp (ABCB1) has several binding sites in its promoter region, along with CpG islands and GC boxes, involved in its epigenetic control. In previous work, we performed a proteomic study to identify proteins involved in IM cross-resistance in acute leukemia. Among these proteins, we identified LRPPRC as a potential regulator of ABCB1 transcription via an invMED1 binding site in ABCB1. Interestingly, this invMED1 binding site overlaps with the GC -100 box. In this work, we investigated the potential role of LRPPRC in the regulation of ABCB1 transcriptional activity in CML resistance. In addition, we evaluated the potential connection between this regulation and the methylation status of the ABCB1 promoter in its GC -100 box. Our results show that LRPPRC binds prominently to the ABCB1 promoter in Lucena cells, an IM-resistant cell line. Luciferase assays showed that ABCB1 transcription is positively regulated by LRPPRC upon its knockdown. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that the ABCB1 promoter is differentially methylated at its GC -100 box in K562 cells compared with Lucena cells, and in CML patients with different response to IM. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and Pgp expression after DNA demethylation treatment showed that LRPPRC binding is affected by the methylation status of ABCB1 GC -100 box.

Few osteosarcoma patients develop t-MDS/AML, but the frequency of hematological abnormalities after therapy is unknown. We reviewed biochemistry from osteosarcoma patients up to 3 years posttreatment. PROCEDURE: All children diagnosed with osteosarcoma at our department from 2006 to 2012 without relapse 1 month posttherapy were included (n=14). Serial blood counts posttherapy were analyzed. RESULTS: The median increase of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) from baseline was 8 fL 6 months posttherapy and remained >5 throughout follow-up. All posttreatment levels of MCV were above 90 fL in 5 patients. Six months posttherapy, the median difference for platelets, white blood count, and absolute neutrophil count had decreased from baseline. They remained under baseline throughout follow-up. Hemoglobin remained stable. Ferritin level was associated with increased MCV. MDS with monosomy 7 was diagnosed in 1 patient. Hypoplastic refractory cytopenia was found in another patient showing spontaneous normalization of hematologic values.

The objective of this study is to establish the association between the previous use of antimicrobials and the development of neutropenic colitis (NC). METHODS: A case-control study was carried out with subjects diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from 2004 to July 2013. They were identified by cross-referencing the databases from the computing area and the records from the pediatric hematology section. Cases were children with neutropenia and fever, abdominal distension and pain, diarrhea or constipation, and ultrasonography or computed tomography showing an intestinal wall thickness of >/=4 mm. Controls were children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with neutropenia and fever, with or without gastrointestinal symptomatology, but without images of NC. RESULTS: Thirty-eight cases and 75 controls were included. The factors associated with the development of NC were severe neutropenia (odds ratio [OR], 12.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3-51; P=0.00001), the use of antimicrobials for >10 days, within the month previous to the appearance of NC (OR, 12.4; 95% CI, 3-51; P=0.00001), and use of doxorubicin (OR, 5.43, 95% CI, 2.1-13.8, P=0.00004).

METHODS: We obtained individual level data from 13 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Occupational data were harmonized to a compatible format. Meta-analyses of study-specific odds ratios (ORs) were undertaken, as well as pooled analyses of individual data using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Using individual data from fathers of 8,185 cases and 14,210 controls, the pooled OR for paternal exposure around conception and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 1.14]. Analysis of data from 8,156 ALL case mothers and 14,568 control mothers produced a pooled OR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.39, 1.68) for exposure during pregnancy. For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the pooled ORs for paternal and maternal exposure were 0.96 (95% CI 0.65, 1.41) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.38, 4.47), respectively, based on data from 1,231 case and 11,392 control fathers and 1,329 case and 12,141 control mothers. Heterogeneity among the individual studies ranged from low to modest. CONCLUSIONS: Null findings for paternal exposure for both ALL and AML are consistent with previous reports. Despite the large sample size, results for maternal exposure to paints in pregnancy were based on small numbers of exposed. Overall, we found no evidence that parental occupational exposure to paints increases the risk of leukemia in the offspring, but further data on home exposure are needed.",,"['Bailey, Helen D', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Petridou, Eleni', 'Roman, Eve', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Dockerty, John D', 'Glass, Deborah C', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Amigou, Alicia', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Bailey HD', 'Fritschi L', 'Metayer C', 'Infante-Rivard C', 'Magnani C', 'Petridou E', 'Roman E', 'Spector LG', 'Kaatsch P', 'Clavel J', 'Milne E', 'Dockerty JD', 'Glass DC', 'Lightfoot T', 'Miligi L', 'Rudant J', 'Baka M', 'Rondelli R', 'Amigou A', 'Simpson J', 'Kang AY', 'Moschovi M', 'Schuz J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paint/*adverse effects', 'Paternal Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,2014/08/05 06:00,2016/01/12 06:00,['2014/08/05 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-014-0441-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2014 Oct;25(10):1351-67. doi: 10.1007/s10552-014-0441-z.

Our studies demonstrate that EZH2 is transcriptionally induced by estradiol in cultured breast cancer cells and in the mammary glands of ovariectomized rats. EZH2 promoter contains multiple functional estrogen-response elements. Estrogen receptors (ERs) and ER coregulators such as mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) histone methylases (MLL2 and MLL3) and histone acetyltransferase CBP/P300 bind to the EZH2 promoter in the presence of estradiol and regulate estradiol-induced EZH2 expression. EZH2 expression is also increased upon exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenol-A (BPA) and diethylstilbestrol (DES). Similar to estradiol, BPA and DES-induced EZH2 expression is coordinated by ERs, MLLs and CBP/P300. In summary, we demonstrate that EZH2 is transcriptionally regulated by estradiol in vitro and in vivo, and its expression is potentially dysregulated upon exposure to estrogenic EDCs.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

Its implication in the initiation and metastasis of various solid tumors is well established, and its tumor-suppressor role in murine osteosarcoma cells has been reported recently. However, the function of TWIST2 and its underlying mechanisms in human normal and malignant hematopoiesis remain unclear. In the present study, we found that TWIST2 directly regulated p21 in human hematopoietic cells and whose silence promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Hypermethylation of TWIST2 occurred to 23 out of the 75 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and resulted in the impaired expression of both TWIST2 and p21. Conversely, TWIST2 overexpression inhibited the growth of AML cells partially through its direct activation of p21 with intact HLH (helix-loop-helix) domain. The microarray data and gene expression validation showed that TWIST2 was sufficient to activate known tumor-suppressor genes, whereas suppress known oncogenes, which further supported its inhibitory effect against AML cells. Taken together, our data have identified a novel TWIST2-p21 axis that modulates the cell cycle of both normal and leukemic cells and demonstrated that the direct regulation of p21 by TWIST2 has a role in its tumor-suppressor function in AML.",,"['Zhang, X', 'Ma, W', 'Cui, J', 'Yao, H', 'Zhou, H', 'Ge, Y', 'Xiao, L', 'Hu, X', 'Liu, B-H', 'Yang, J', 'Li, Y-Y', 'Chen, S', 'Eaves, C J', 'Wu, D', 'Zhao, Y']","['Zhang X', 'Ma W', 'Cui J', 'Yao H', 'Zhou H', 'Ge Y', 'Xiao L', 'Hu X', 'Liu BH', 'Yang J', 'Li YY', 'Chen S', 'Eaves CJ', 'Wu D', 'Zhao Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TWIST2 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/08/05 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/08/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014241 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.241 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Jun 4;34(23):3000-10. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.241.

RESULTS: GRAF expression was significantly lower in patients with AML when compared to controls (P=0.008). There were no significant differences in clinical features, FAB subtypes and cytogenetic risk subgroups between patients with high and low GRAF expression levels. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high GRAF expression had longer overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that, besides WBC count, GRAF expression was also an independent prognostic factor for AML.

The improved clinical response of nilotinib over that of the first generation TKI, imatinib, has been thought to be a result of its high potency of inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase. This study aimed to characterize differences between nilotinib and imatinib in the intracellular accumulation and cytotoxic effect on the CML cell line K562. Accumulation of nilotinib in K562 cells was from 4.7- to 9.0-fold higher than that of imatinib. The cytotoxic effect of nilotinib on K562 cells was 14.2-fold higher than that of imatinib. Inhibition experiments in K562 cells, and examination of the cellular uptake using influx transporter-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, suggested that the influx transporters OCT1 and OATP1A2, which have been reported to mediate accumulation of imatinib in CML cells, contributed little to the uptake of nilotinib. Nilotinib was found to accumulate in imatinib-resistant K562 (K562/IM) cells overexpressing the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), although cytotoxic assays showed that K562/IM cells displayed 20000-fold greater resistance to nilotinib over the parent K562 cells. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that intracellular accumulation of nilotinib in CML cells contributes to its clinical response and efficacy in CML patients. Although nilotinib has been reported to be effective against imatinib-resistant ABL kinase mutants, the drug could not overcome imatinib resistance acquired by P-gp-overexpression. These results imply that classification of mechanisms of drug resistance is important for suitable strategies to treat imatinib-resistant CML patients.",,"['Yamakawa, Yuji', 'Hamada, Akinobu', 'Uchida, Takashi', 'Sato, Daisuke', 'Yuki, Misato', 'Hayashi, Masahiro', 'Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Saito, Hideyuki']","['Yamakawa Y', 'Hamada A', 'Uchida T', 'Sato D', 'Yuki M', 'Hayashi M', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Saito H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,,2014/08/05 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/08/05 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/bpb/b14-00254 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.b14-00254 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2014;37(8):1330-5. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b14-00254.,37,,"['Department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies showed that K-562 cells pretreated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HPC), which is a preactivated analog of cyclophosphamide (CY), enhanced the cytotoxicity of etoposide (VP-16). The appearance of cellular resistance to anticancer drugs is a major problem in cancer chemotherapy. P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) plays an important role in drug resistance, and VP-16 is a substrate for this efflux pump. In the present study, we demonstrated schedule-dependent cytotoxicity of VP-16 and CY in P-gp-overexpressed K-562/P-gp cells. Cytotoxicity of VP-16 was enhanced in K-562/P-gp cells that were pretreated with a non-cytotoxic concentration of 4-HPC compared to that of cells not treated with 4-HPC. 4-HPC arrested the cell cycle at S phase.

These compounds could cause injury to cell DNA, which might lead in cancer like chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Individual inherited genetic differences related to polymorphism in detoxification enzymes could be an important factor not only in carcinogen metabolism but also in susceptibility of cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MDR1 gene in the susceptibility of CML. We successively have determined the genotype profiles of 1236 C>T (exon 12); 2677 G>T (exon 21), and 3435 C>T (exon 26) SNPs by PCR-RFLP in 89 patients and 99 unrelated healthy controls. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of each SNP on the development of CML. Interestingly, in exon 12, the 1236 TT was significantly associated with the susceptibility of CML when compared to the wild type 1236 CC (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1-7.32, p = 0.041). Additionally, the recessive model 1236 TT vs. 1236 CC/CT showed a risk of 3.3 fold (p = 0.011) with CML. In exon 26, the 3435 CT genotype was associated with a reduced risk of CML (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-1, p = 0.042). In exon 21, the 2677 GT genotype seems to have a protective effect (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.32-1.1, p = 0.074). Diplolotypes analysis has demonstrated no effect in susceptibility of CML, but 1236 CT/3435 CC and 1236 CC/2677 GT were associated with a protective effect. The haplotypes analysis showed no particular trend (global association p = 0.33). Our findings demonstrate that 1236 TT in exon 12 might contribute in the susceptibility of CML, while the 3435 CT in exon 26 as well as 1236 CT/3435 CC and 1236 CC/2677 GT combinations might be protective factors.",,"['Yaya, Kassogue', 'Hind, Dehbi', 'Meryem, Quachouh', 'Asma, Quessar', 'Said, Benchekroun', 'Sellama, Nadifi']","['Yaya K', 'Hind D', 'Meryem Q', 'Asma Q', 'Said B', 'Sellama N']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/08/05 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/08/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2400-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Nov;35(11):10969-75. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2400-4.

Humans have at least 44 chemokines that are further classified into four subfamilies based on the N-terminal conserved cysteine motifs: CXC, CC, C and CX3C. All the known chemokine receptors are seven transmembrane-type receptors. Humans have 18 chemotactic and 5 atypical non-chemotactic (recycling or scavenging) receptors. CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is the receptor for two CC chemokine ligands (CCLs)-CCL17 (also called thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine) and CCL22 (macrophage-derived chemokine). Among the various T-cell subsets, CCR4 is predominantly expressed by Th2 cells, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen-positive skin-homing T cells and Treg cells. Thus, CCR4 attracts much attention for its possible clinical applications in diseases involving these T-cell subsets. Furthermore, CCR4 is often highly expressed by mature T-cell neoplasms such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). This article is a brief overview of basic and clinical research on CCR4 and its ligands, which has eventually led to the development of a humanized defucosylated anti-CCR4 antibody 'Mogamulizumab' for treatment of relapsed/refractory ATL and CTCLs.","['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2014.

The CBM complex forms an essential molecular link between the triggering of cell-surface antigen receptors and nuclear factor kappaB activation.

There are no guidelines for screening or management of patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (>1000mg/dL) during ALL therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fasting lipid profiles were obtained prospectively at four time-points for 257 children consecutively enrolled on a frontline ALL study. Risk factors were evaluated by the exact chi-square test. Details of adverse events and management of hypertriglyceridaemia were extracted retrospectively. RESULTS: Eighteen of 257 (7%) patients developed severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Older age and treatment with higher doses of asparaginase and steroids on the standard/high-risk arm were significant risk factors. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was not associated with pancreatitis after adjustment for age and treatment arm or with osteonecrosis after adjustment for age. However, patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia had a 2.5-3 times higher risk of thrombosis compared to patients without, albeit the difference was not statistically significant. Of the 30 episodes of severe hypertriglyceridaemia in 18 patients, seven were managed conservatively while the others with pharmacotherapy. Seventeen of 18 patients continued to receive asparaginase and steroids. Triglyceride levels normalised after completion of ALL therapy in all 12 patients with available measurements. CONCLUSION: Asparaginase- and steroid-induced transient hypertriglyceridaemia can be adequately managed with dietary modifications and close monitoring without altering chemotherapy. Patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia were not at increased risk of adverse events, with a possible exception of thrombosis. The benefit of pharmacotherapy in decreasing symptoms and potential complications requires further investigation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Defects in natural killer (NK) cell and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity result in a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, cytopenia, coagulopathy, and multi-organ system dysfunction. MAS can occur in association with infections (herpes viruses), cancer (leukemia), immune deficient states (post-transplantation), and in autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus) and autoinflammatory conditions (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis).

Novel therapeutic strategies to treat them include: (i) growth factor delivery to boost endogenous repair and (ii) replacement cell therapy, including replacing dopaminergic neurons to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these approaches are restricted not only by rapid degradation of growth factors, but also by the limited availability of cells for transplant and the poor survival of implanted cells that lack the necessary stromal support. We therefore hypothesised that provision of a transient artificial stroma for paracrine delivery of pro-survival factors could overcome both of these issues. Using leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) - a proneural, reparative cytokine - formulated as target-specific poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nano-particles (LIF-nano-stroma), we discovered that attachment of LIF-nano-stroma to freshly isolated fetal dopaminergic cells improved their survival fourfold: furthermore, in vivo, the number of surviving human fetal dopaminergic cells tended to be higher at 3 months after grafting into the striatum of nude rats, compared with controls treated with empty nanoparticles. In addition, we also analysed the effect of a novel nano-stroma incorporating XAV939 (XAV), a potent inhibitor of the developmentally important Wnt-beta-catenin signalling pathway, to investigate whether it could also promote the survival and differentiation of human fetal dopaminergic precursors; we found that the numbers of both tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive neurons (a marker of dopaminergic neurons) and total neurons were increased. This is the first demonstration that LIF-nano-stroma and XAV-nano-stroma each have pro-survival effects on human dopaminergic neurons, with potential value for target-specific modulation of neurogenic fate in cell-based therapies for PD.",['(c) 2014.

Patients were randomized as follows: arm 1 - tacrolimus 180 days and mycophenolate mofetil 95 days (n=69); arm 2 - tacrolimus 150 days and mycophenolate mofetil 180 days (n=71); arm 3 - tacrolimus 150 days, mycophenolate mofetil 180 days and sirolimus 80 days (n=68). All patients had sustained engraftment. Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease rates in the 3 arms were 64%, 48% and 47% at Day 150, respectively (arm 3 vs. arm 1 (hazard ratio 0.62; P=0.04). Owing to the decreased incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, systemic steroid use was lower at Day 150 in arm 3 (32% vs. 55% in arm 1 and 49% in arm 2; overall P=0.009 by hazard ratio analysis). The Day 150 incidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation was lower in arm 3 (arm 1, 54%; arm 2, 47%; arm 3, 22%; overall P=0.002 by hazard ratio analysis). Non-relapse mortality was comparable in the three arms at two years (arm 1, 26%; arm 2, 23%; arm 3, 18%). Toxicity rates and other outcome measures were similar between the three arms. The addition of sirolimus to tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil is safe and associated with lower incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease and cytomegalovirus reactivation.

Although it led to a reduction in non-relapse mortality, disease control remains a major challenge. We studied the outcome of 165 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n=124) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=41) transplanted after conditioning with fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days), intravenous busulfan (either 260 mg/m(2): reduced intensity conditioning, or 390-520 mg/m(2): reduced toxicity conditioning), and rabbit anti-thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days). The median age of the patients at transplantation was 56.8 years. The 2-year relapse incidence was 29% (23% versus 39% for patients transplanted in first complete remission and those transplanted beyond first complete remission, respectively; P=0.008). The 2-year progression-free survival rate was 57% (95% CI: 49.9-65).

One of the antigenic structures recognized is oxidation-induced malonedialdehyde that is present on low-density lipoprotein, apoptotic blebs, and on certain microbes. The poor-prognostic stereotyped subset #1 (Clan I IGHV genes-IGKV1(D)-39) express IgM B-cell receptors that bind oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In this study, we have used for the first time this authentic cognate antigen for analysis of downstream B-cell receptor-signal transduction events, since it is more faithful to B-cell physiology than anti-IgM. Multivalent oxidized low-density lipoprotein showed specific binding to subset #1 IgM/IgD B-cell receptors, whereas native low-density lipoprotein did not. The antigen binding induced prompt receptor clustering followed by internalization. However, the receptor-signal transduction was silenced, revealing no Ca(2+) mobilization or cell-cycle entry, while phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 basal levels were high and could not be elevated further by oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Interestingly, B-cell receptor responsiveness was recovered after 48-h culture in the absence of antigen in half of the cases. Toll-like receptor 9-ligand was found to breach the B-cell receptor-signaling incompetence in 5 of 12 cases pointing to intra-subset heterogeneity. Altogether, this study supports B-cell receptor unresponsiveness to cognate self-antigen on its own in poor-prognostic subset #1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indicating that these cells proliferate by other mechanisms that may override B-cell receptor silencing brought about in a context of self-tolerance/anergy.

This study detected levels of CXXC4 and TET2 mRNA to determine their association with survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Levels of TET2 and CXXC4 mRNA were analyzed in bone marrow samples from 154 MDS patients and 50 control subjects using qRT-PCR and subsequently associated these levels with clinicopathological characteristics and survival of MDS patients. RESULTS: Levels of TET2 and CXXC4 mRNA were significantly lower in MDS patients than that in controls (P=0.009 and P<0.001, respectively). Patients with advanced WHO subtypes (e.g., RAEB-1 and RAEB-2) exhibited a higher level of CXXC4 mRNA (P=0.020) compared to those with early stage subtypes (i.e., RA, RARS, RCMD, RCMD-RS, 5q-syndrome, and MDS-U). Moreover, levels of CXXC4 mRNA were associated with marrow blast levels (P=0.014) and neutrophil counts (P=0.039). Levels of CXXC4 mRNA and hemoglobin and IPSS cytopenias were associated with the overall survival (P=0.025) but not with the leukemia-free survival of MDS patients. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the age of patients and levels of hemoglobin and marrow blast were independent risk factors for survival of MDS patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the age of patients and levels of CXXC4 mRNA, hemoglobin, and marrow blast associated with survival of MDS patients.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a multi-ethnic sample of cases and controls from Houston, TX, we examined two HFE variants (rs1800562 and rs1799945), one transferrin receptor gene (TFRC) variant (rs3817672) and three additional iron regulatory gene (IRG) variants (SLC11A2 rs422982; TMPRSS6 rs855791 and rs733655) for their associations with childhood ALL. Being positive for either of the HFE variants yielded a modestly elevated odds ratio (OR) for childhood ALL risk in males (1.40, 95% CI=0.83-2.35), which increased to 2.96 (95% CI=1.29-6.80) in the presence of a particular TFRC genotype for rs3817672 (P interaction=0.04). The TFRC genotype also showed an ethnicity-specific association, with increased risk observed in non-Hispanic Whites (OR=2.54, 95% CI=1.05-6.12; P interaction with ethnicity=0.02). The three additional IRG SNPs all showed individual risk associations with childhood ALL in males (OR=1.52-2.60). A polygenic model based on the number of variant alleles in five IRG SNPs revealed a linear increase in risk among males with the increasing number of variants possessed (OR=2.0 per incremental change, 95% CI=1.29-3.12; P=0.002).

Among them, APOBEC1 is the only family member to physiologically target RNA, as the catalytic subunit in the Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex. APOBEC1 has been linked to cancer development in mice but its oncogenic mechanisms are not yet well understood. RESULTS: We analyze whether expression of APOBEC1 induces a mutator phenotype in vertebrate cells, likely through direct targeting of genomic DNA. We show its ability to increase the inactivation of a stably inserted reporter gene in a chicken cell line that lacks any other AID/APOBEC proteins, and to increase the number of imatinib-resistant clones in a human cellular model for chronic myeloid leukemia through induction of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Moreover, we find the presence of an AID/APOBEC mutational signature in esophageal adenocarcinomas, a type of tumor where APOBEC1 is expressed, that mimics the one preferred by APOBEC1 in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the ability of APOBEC1 to trigger genetic alterations represents a major layer in its oncogenic potential. Such APOBEC1-induced mutator phenotypes could play a role in the onset of esophageal adenocarcinomas. APOBEC1 could be involved in cancer promotion at the very early stages of carcinogenesis, as it is highly expressed in Barrett's esophagus, a condition often associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma.",,"['Saraconi, Giulia', 'Severi, Francesco', 'Sala, Cesare', 'Mattiuz, Giorgio', 'Conticello, Silvestro G']","['Saraconi G', 'Severi F', 'Sala C', 'Mattiuz G', 'Conticello SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.5.4.36 (APOBEC-1 Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.36 (APOBEC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.36 (Apobec1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.36 (Apobec1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'Adenocarcinoma Of Esophagus']",IM,"['APOBEC-1 Deaminase', 'Adenocarcinoma/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens/genetics', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Rats']",,,2014/08/03 06:00,2015/06/20 06:00,['2014/08/03 06:00'],"['2013/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['s13059-014-0417-z [pii]', '10.1186/s13059-014-0417-z [doi]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2014 Jul 31;15(7):417. doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0417-z.,15,10.1186/s13059-014-0417-z [doi],,PMC4144122,,20140731,,,,,,,['Genome Biol. 2014;15(11):497'],,,,,,,,,,

Wee1 inhibitors have been used to prevent activation of the G2 cell cycle checkpoint, thus enhancing the antitumor activity of DNA damaging agents. In this study, we investigated MK-1775 in AML cell lines and diagnostic blast samples to identify sensitive subtypes as well as possible mechanisms of resistance. METHODS: In vitro MK-1775 cytotoxicities of AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts were measured using MTT assays. The effects of MK-1775 on cell cycle progression and related proteins were determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting. Drug-induced apoptosis was determined using annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: We found that newly diagnosed and relapsed patient samples were equally sensitive to MK-1775. In addition, patient samples harboring t(15;17) translocation were significantly more sensitive to MK-1775 than non-t(15;17) samples. MK-1775 induced apoptosis in both AML cell lines and diagnostic blast samples, accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of CDK1 and CDK2 on Tyr-15 and increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Time-course experiments, using AML cell lines, revealed a time-dependent increase in DNA DSBs, activation of CHK1 and subsequent apoptosis following MK-1775 treatment, which could be attenuated by a CDK1/2 inhibitor, Roscovitine. Simultaneous inhibition of CHK1 and Wee1 resulted in synergistic anti-leukemic activity in both AML cell lines and primary patient samples ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides compelling evidence that CHK1 plays a critical role in the anti-leukemic activity of MK-1775 and highlights a possible mechanism of resistance to MK-1775. In addition, our study strongly supports the use of MK-1775 to treat both newly diagnosed and relapsed AML, especially cases with t(15;17) translocation, and supports the development of combination therapies with CHK1 inhibitors.",,"['Qi, Wenxiu', 'Xie, Chengzhi', 'Li, Chunhuai', 'Caldwell, J Timothy', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Wang, Yue', 'Lin, Hai', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Qi W', 'Xie C', 'Li C', 'Caldwell JT', 'Edwards H', 'Taub JW', 'Wang Y', 'Lin H', 'Ge Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'K2T6HJX3I3 (adavosertib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/08/03 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/08/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0053-9 [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0053-9 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Aug 1;7:53. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0053-9.,7,10.1186/s13045-014-0053-9 [doi],"['National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology & Engineering, the Ministry of Education, and School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China. wangyue7373@126.com.']",PMC4237862,,20140801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients undergoing preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation using radiation therapy (RT) with either total lymphoid irradiation or fractionated total body irradiation were eligible. Plasma was examined from patients with potentially confounding conditions and from normal individuals. Each plasma sample was analyzed for a panel of 17 proteins before RT was begun and at several time points after RT exposure. Paired and unpaired t tests between the dose and control groups were performed. Conditional inference trees were constructed based on panels of proteins to compare the non-RT group with the RT group. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients (62 RT, 41 infection, 48 trauma) were enrolled on the study, and the plasma from an additional 24 healthy control individuals was analyzed. In comparison with to control individuals, tenascin-C was upregulated and clusterin was downregulated in patients receiving RT. Salivary amylase was strongly radiation responsive, with upregulation in total body irradiation patients and slight downregulation in total lymphoid irradiation patients compared with control individuals. A panel consisting of these 3 proteins accurately distinguished between irradiated patients and healthy control individuals within 3 days after exposure: 97% accuracy, 0.5% false negative rate, 2% false positive rate. The accuracy was diminished when patients with trauma, infection, or both were included (accuracy, 74%-84%; false positive rate, 14%-33%, false negative rate: 8%-40%). CONCLUSIONS: A panel of 3 proteins accurately distinguishes unirradiated healthy donors from those exposed to RT (0.8-9.6 Gy) within 3 days of exposure.

Pharmacological inhibitors of FAS activity preferentially repress cancer cell proliferation and induce cancer cell apoptosis without affecting nonmalignant fibroblasts. These made FAS an excellent drug target for cancer therapy. The activity of FAS in 11 different kinds of cancer cells, including esophageal carcinoma (EC109, EC8712, H5E973), gastric carcinoma (N87, BGC823), lung carcinoma (A549, 95-D), hepatoma (HepG2), uterine cervix cancer (HeLa) and leukaemia (K562, U937) were compared using spectrophotometric method. We selected the cell line with the highest FAS activity as cell model to study the inhibitory effect of the flavonoids extracts on FAS. Four plants including Canavium album Raeuseh leaves, Bombax ceiba Linn, Brassica albograbra Bailey, and Citrus reticulata Blanco were selected for extracting flavonoids. The results showed significantly different FAS activity among different cancer cells. The FAS activity is the lowest in gastric cancer cell N87 (15.91 +/- 3.61 U/mg protein) and the highest in lung cancer cell A549 (127.36 +/- 10.14 U/mg protein). The cancer cell A549 was used as cell model to test the inhibitory effort of flavonoids extracts on FAS. Results showed that the flavonoids extracts of Citrus reticulata Blanco and Canavium album Raeuseh leaves have higher inhibitory effect on FAS activity compared with the universally used FAS inhibitor C75 and both extracts inhibit cancer cell proliferation when added to cultured cancer cells.

VCR cytotoxicity is primarily due to its ability to disrupt the formation of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. PATIENTS & METHODS: Seventeen polymorphisms in regulatory and coding regions of genes controlling VCR targets (TUBB1, MAP4, ACTG1 and CAPG) or potentially influencing VCR levels (ABCB1 and CYP3A5) were investigated for an association with peripheral neuropathy and outcome in childhood ALL patients. RESULTS: High-grade neurotoxicity was more frequent in carriers of the A allele of synonymous (Ala310) G to A (rs1135989) variation in the ACTG1 gene. Substitution (rs4728709) in the promoter of the ABCB1 gene had a protective effect against lower grade neurotoxicity and C to A variation (rs3770102) located 17 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site had a protective effect against high-grade neurotoxicity. Patients with the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had lower event-free survival; the association with event-free survival was not supported by the analysis in the replication patient set.

Cancer stem cells are a small portion of cancer cells within the main neoplasm and can remain alive during chemotherapy and re-induce tumor growth. The EST-SSR background of cancer stem cells and possible roles of expressed SSRs in altering normal stem cells to cancer ones have not been investigated yet. Here, SSR distributions in hematopoietic normal and cancer stem cells were compared based on the expressed EST-SSR. One hundred eighty nine and 223 EST-SSRs were identified in cancer and normal stem cells, respectively. The EST-SSR expression pattern was significantly different between normal and cancer stem cells. The frequencies of AC/GT and TA/TA EST-SSRs were about 10% higher in cancer than normal stem cells. Remarkably, the number of triplets in cancer stem cells was 1.5 times higher than that in normal stem cells. GAT EST-SSR was frequent in cancer stem cells, but, conversely, normal stem cells did not express GAT EST-SSR. We suggest this EST-SSR as a novel triplet in cancer stem cell induction. Translating EST-SSRs to amino acids demonstrated that Asp and Ile were more abundant in cancer stem cells compared to normal stem cells. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was carried out on genes containing triplet SSRs and showed that SSRs intentionally visit some specific GO classes. Interestingly, a NF-kappa (nuclear factor-kB) binding transcription factor was significantly hit by SSR instability which is a hallmark for leukemia stem cells. NF-kappa is an over represented transcription factor during cancer progression. It seems that there is a crosstalk between the NF-kB transcription factor and expressed GAT tandem repeat which negatively regulate apoptosis. In addition to better understanding of tumorigenesis, the findings of this study offer new DNA markers for diagnostic purposes and identifying at risk populations. In addition, a new approach for gene discovery in cancer by target analysis of differentially expressed EST-SSRs between cancer and normal stem cells is presented here.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By integrating transcriptome profiles with chromatin state maps, we have uncovered many previously unreported T-ALL-specific lncRNA genes, a fraction of which are directly controlled by the Notch1/Rpbjkappa activator complex. Finally we have shown that one specific Notch-regulated lncRNA, LUNAR1, is required for efficient T-ALL growth in vitro and in vivo due to its ability to enhance IGF1R mRNA expression and sustain IGF1 signaling. These results confirm that lncRNAs are important downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, and additionally they are key regulators of the oncogenic state in T-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Two of four xenografts developed ex vivo and in vivo drug resistance. Both resistant lines showed altered lipid and cholesterol metabolism, yet they had a distinct drug resistance pattern. CMap analyses reinforced these features, identifying the cholesterol pathway inhibitor simvastatin (SVT) as a potential therapy to overcome resistance. Combined ex vivo with DEX, SVT was significantly synergistic, yet when administered in vivo with VXLD it did not delay leukemia progression.

In this study, we explored the functional properties of T-cells using primary samples from CML patients (n = 28) on TKI therapy. Granzyme B (GrB) was used as a marker for late phase antigen experienced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Dasatinib treatment increased the numbers of both GrB expressing memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells when compared with healthy controls. Functionally, the GrB+CD4+ T-cells were highly active and differentiated into Th1-type T-cells capable of producing IFN-gamma, which is important for tumor control. Similar kind of increase was not observed during imatinib or nilotinib therapy.

The molecular basis of HOXB4-mediated benign HSC expansion in vivo is not well understood. To gain further insight into the molecular events underlying HOXB4-mediated HSC expansion, we analyzed gene expression changes at multiple time points in Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) cells from mice transplanted with bone marrow cells transduced with a MSCV-HOXB4-ires-YFP vector. A distinct HOXB4 transcriptional program was reproducibly induced and stabilized by 12 weeks after transplant. Dynamic expression changes were observed in genes critical for HSC self-renewal as well as in genes involved in myeloid and B-cell differentiation. Prdm16, a transcription factor associated with human acute myeloid leukemia, was markedly repressed by HOXB4 but upregulated by HOXA9 and HOXA10, suggesting that Prdm16 downregulation was involved in preventing leukemia in HOXB4 transplanted mice. Functional evidence to support this mechanism was obtained by enforcing coexpression of sPrdm16 and HOXB4, which led to enhanced self-renewal, myeloid expansion, and leukemia.

AIMS: To determine the overall cancer incidence in both cohorts merged, with an extended follow-up. METHODS: The merged cohort yielded 41,140 individuals followed for cancer diagnoses 1999-2009. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by gender and by period of first employment using cancer registry data. RESULTS: Among female workers, the total number of cancers was slightly higher than expected (SIR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.34), and excesses of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (SIR 5.29, 95% CI 1.72-12), malignant melanoma (SIR 2.13, 95% CI 1.41-3.08) and lung cancer (SIR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03-2.61) were observed. Among male workers, the total number of cancer cases was close to that expected (SIR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08), but cases of pleural cancer (SIR 2.56, 95% CI 1.58-3.91) and bladder cancer (SIR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49) were higher than expected. Among male workers first employed before 1986, the numbers of observed cancer cases were higher than expected for most sites, while this was not evident among those employed later. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies with exposure data and confounder control are needed to address whether the observed excesses of pleural cancer and AML can be attributed to offshore work.","['(c) The Author 2014.

This investigation used a mathematical model of hematopoiesis and a dataset derived from the North American Intergroup Study INT0129. The known phenotypic constraints of APL could be explained by a combination of differentiation blockade of PML-RARalpha-positive cells and suppression of normal hematopoiesis. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) neutralizes the differentiation block and decreases the proliferation rate of leukemic stem cells in vivo. Prolonged ATRA treatment after chemotherapy can cure patients with APL by eliminating the stem-like cell population over the course of approximately one year.

MLL forms a ternary complex with the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) and MENIN. LEDGF/p75, a chromatin reader recognizing H3K36me3 marks, contributes to the association of the MLL multiprotein complex to chromatin. Formation of this complex is critical for the development of MLL leukemia. Available X-ray data represent only a partial structure of the LEDGF/p75-MLL-MENIN complex. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified an additional LEDGF/p75-MLL interface, which overlaps with the binding site of known LEDGF/p75 interactors-HIV-1 integrase, PogZ, and JPO2. Binding of these proteins or MLL to LEDGF/p75 is mutually exclusive. The resolved structure, as well as mutational analysis, shows that the interaction is primarily sustained via two aromatic residues of MLL (F148 and F151). Colony-forming assays in MLL-AF9(+) leukemic cells expressing MLL interaction-defective LEDGF/p75 mutants revealed that this interaction is essential for transformation. Finally, we show that the clonogenic growth of primary murine MLL-AF9-expressing leukemic blasts is selectively impaired upon overexpression of a LEDGF/p75-binding cyclic peptide CP65, originally developed to inhibit the LEDGF/p75-HIV-1 integrase interaction. The newly defined protein-protein interface therefore represents a new target for the development of therapeutics against LEDGF/p75-dependent MLL fusion-driven leukemic disorders.

Recently, 5-LO was shown to be critical to maintain CSC in a model of chronic myeloid leukemia. For these reasons, we hypothesized that 5-LO may offer a therapeutic target to improve the management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive disease driven by CSCs. Pharmacologic and genetic approaches were used to evaluate the effects of 5-LO blockade in a PML/RARalpha-positive model of AML. As CSC models, we used Sca-1(+)/lin(-) murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), which were retrovirally transduced with PML/RARalpha. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of 5-LO interfered strongly with the aberrant stem cell capacity of PML/RARalpha-expressing HSPCs. Through small-molecule inhibitor studies and genetic disruption of 5-LO, we also found that Wnt and CSC inhibition is mediated by the enzymatically inactive form of 5-LO, which hinders nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Overall, our findings revealed that 5-LO inhibitors also inhibit Wnt signaling, not due to the interruption of 5-LO-mediated lipid signaling but rather due to the generation of a catalytically inactive form of 5-LO, which assumes a new function.

A single nucleotide polymorphism in the MDM2 promotor region, MDM2SNP309, was shown to soothe the p53 pathway. In the current study, we aimed to clarify the effect of the MDM2SNP309 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia characteristics and outcome. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 2598 individual patients from 10 different cohorts. Patients' data and genetic analysis for MDM2SNP309 genotype, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status and fluorescence in situ hybridization results were collected. There were no differences in overall survival based on the polymorphism (log rank test, stratified by study cohort; P=0.76; GG genotype: cohort-adjusted median overall survival of 151 months; TG: 153 months; TT: 149 months). In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, advanced age, male sex and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes were associated with inferior survival, but not the MDM2 genotype. The MDM2SNP309 is unlikely to influence disease characteristics and prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Studies investigating the impact of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms on prognosis are often controversial. This may be due to selection bias and small sample size. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data provides a reasonable strategy for prognostic factor analyses in the case of small individual studies. Individual patient data-based meta-analysis can, therefore, be a powerful tool to assess genetic risk factors in the absence of large studies.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Benner,

In recent years, work to characterize the leukemia stem cell population, the disease compartment most difficult to eliminate with conventional therapy and most responsible for relapse, has been undertaken. This, in conjunction with advances in drug development that have allowed for increasingly targeted therapies to be engineered, raises the hope that we are entering an era in which the leukemia stem cell population can be eliminated, resulting in therapeutic cures for acute myeloid leukemia patients. For these therapies to become available, they must be tested in the setting of clinical trials. A long-established clinical trials infrastructure has been employed to shepherd new therapies from proof-of-concept to approval. However, due to the unique features of leukemia stem cells, drugs that are designed to specifically eliminate this population may not be adequately tested when applied to this model.

A 58-year-old man, without a significant past medical history, was found dead at his workplace. An external examination showed subcutaneous hemorrhage on the left upper extremity. Macroscopic autopsy findings revealed a massive hemoperitoneum (1000mL) and extensive hematoma in the mesentery. Histopathological findings showed monotonous cell proliferation not only in the mesentery, but in many organs, such as the liver, spleen, and kidney; aggregates of the infiltrating cells were also observed in the microvessels of various organs. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that the infiltrating cells showed variable myeloperoxidase positivity, and the cells were strongly positive for CD68 (PG-M1). From the autopsy findings and the immunohistochemical staining, we concluded that the underlying cause of death was acute myeloid leukemia (M5).

Beside pharmaco-economic considerations making metronomics a unique opportunity in low- or middle-income countries, revisiting dosing schedules using continuous low doses of cytotoxics should theoretically permit to reduce the incidence of treatment-related toxicities, while offering unexpected novel mechanisms of actions such as antiangiogenic or immuno-stimulating properties. Consequently, a number of clinical trials sought to evaluate to what extent switching to metronomic schedules could actually impact indeed on the efficacy/toxicity balance of a variety of anticancer drugs in both adults and pediatric oncology. Vinorelbine is a vinca-alcaloid that remains the backbone of several regimens to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, vinorelbine is widely used to treat a variety of solid tumors in children such as rhabdomyosarcomas and acute leukemia. The recent approval of an oral formulation of vinorelbine has open the way to developing alternative metronomic schedules with this drug. Consequently, a number of clinical trials investigating on metronomic vinorelbine have been performed over the last few years, with seemingly inconsistent results to date. Of note, all the studies published thus far were based upon empirical determination of the metronomic schedule, both in terms of doses, drug-free intervals and repartition of the administrations throughout time. Because the very concept of <<low, repeated doses with little or no drug-free interval>> covers numerous possible combinations, determining the optimal protocol using traditional under-powered empirical design looks like an unreachable goal. In this context, mathematical modeling offers invaluable in silico tools to help determining the optimal metronomic schedule among a variety of possibilities. This review covers the latest clinical trials investigating on metronomic vinorelbine and proposes alternative strategies for developing computational decision support to make metronomics a scientific-grounded strategy, rather than an empirical practice at the bedside. In particular, mathematical simulations using an original pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics constraint models provide clues for exploring new paths in the way metronomic vinorelbine could be scheduled in patients with lung cancer.",,"['Barbolosi, Dominique', 'Ciccolini, Joseph', 'Meille, Christophe', 'Elharrar, Xavier', 'Faivre, Christian', 'Lacarelle, Bruno', 'Andre, Nicolas', 'Barlesi, Fabrice']","['Barbolosi D', 'Ciccolini J', 'Meille C', 'Elharrar X', 'Faivre C', 'Lacarelle B', 'Andre N', 'Barlesi F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",IM,"['*Administration, Metronomic', 'Administration, Oral', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Vinorelbine']",,,2014/08/02 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/08/02 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2546-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Sep;74(3):647-52. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2546-1.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Two outpatient cancer clinics. SAMPLE: 77 young adult survivors of childhood cancer aged 18-30 years. METHODS: Charts were selected from June to December 2009 and data were extracted using a structured questionnaire. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Oncology practitioner assessment of alcohol use and alcohol consumption of young adult cancer survivors. FINDINGS: Alcohol screening was conducted for 48 participants. No significant differences were noted in most variables between those not screened for alcohol use and those screened for alcohol use. Of the 48 screened for alcohol use, 30 reported ""no use."" For the 18 who reported alcohol use, the terms used to describe the frequency varied and were vague. CONCLUSIONS: The key finding of the study was that screening and documentation of alcohol consumption was poorly and inconsistently performed in the authors' sample of young adult cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Similar to healthy young adults aged 18-30 years, young adult cancer survivors are at a developmental age where it is likely they will engage in unhealthy drinking; therefore, they should be screened for alcohol use and binge drinking.

For instance, MR(3.0) was reached at 3 months in 36% vs. 8% (P = 0.02), at 12 months in 81% vs. 46% (P = 0.02) and at 18 months in 73% vs. 65% (n.s.) of the patients in the two groups. In contrast, MR(4.5) was consistently superior in the dasatinib group at all time points from 6 months onwards, reaching 61% vs. 21% (P < 0.05) at 36 months. Sixty-four vs. 71% of the patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively, remained on assigned drug. Dasatinib dose was frequently reduced, but with maintained excellent effect. One imatinib patient progressed to blastic phase, but no CML-related deaths occurred. In conclusion, our data compare favourably with those of the dasatinib registration study, DASISION. The fast and deep molecular responses induced by dasatinib compared with imatinib may be exploited to increase the proportion of patients who can achieve a treatment-free remission after treatment discontinuation.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Recently, we have shown that BCR-ABL promotes PTEN nuclear exclusion, through the modulation of HAUSP activity. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigate HAUSP cellular compartmentalization in primary CML samples. RESULTS: While in normal CD34 positive cells HAUSP is expressed mostly in the nucleus, in CML CD34 cells HAUSP is expressed both in the nuclear bodies and in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: This observation suggests that HAUSP behaves as a shuttling protein in CML. It can bind to BCR-ABL in the cytosol, where it is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and it maintains the proper compartmentalization in the nuclear bodies, where it acts as part of a PML network to regulate PTEN de-ubiquitination.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Metabolic syndrome is a consequence of multiple factors, particularly hormonal imbalance induced by various ALL treatments. This review aims to evaluate the risk factors and mechanisms leading to the development of metabolic syndrome. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to insulin resistance and the associated endothelial and adipose tissue dysfunction. Future studies should also examine other possible contributing factors, such as environmental and genetic factors. Understanding these factors will help in guiding modifications of the current ALL treatment protocols in order to prevent the development of this syndrome and hence improve the quality of life of ALL survivors. Until this is achieved, clinicians should continue to identify patients at risk early and use a therapeutic approach that combines dietary restrictions and enhanced physical activity.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

In the absence of good follow-up facilities, it is often difficult to assess the complete prevalence of cancer for a given registry area. An attempt is made to arrive at the complete prevalence including limited duration prevalence with respect of selected sites of cancer for India by fitting appropriate models to 1, 3 and 5 year cancer survival data available for selected registries of India. METHODOLOGY: Cancer survival data, available for the registries of Bhopal, Chennai, Karunagappally, and Mumbai was pooled to generate survival for the selected cancer sites. With the available data on survival for 1, 3 and 5 years, a model was fitted and the survival curve was extended beyond 5 years (up to 30 years) for each of the selected sites. This helped in generation of survival proportions by single year and thereby survival of cancer cases. With the help of estimated survived cases available year wise and the incidence, the prevalence figures were arrived for selected cancer sites and for selected periods. In our previous paper, we have dealt with the cancer sites of breast, cervix, ovary, lung, stomach and mouth (Takiar and Jayant, 2013). RESULTS: The prevalence to incidence ratio (PI ratio) was calculated for 30 years duration for all the selected cancer sites using the model approach showing that from the knowledge of incidence and P/I ratio, the prevalence can be calculated. The validity of the approach was shown in our previous paper (Takiar and Jayant, 2013). The P/I ratios for the cancer sites of lip, tongue, oral cavity, hypopharynx, oesophagus, larynx, nhl, colon, prostate, lymphoid leukemia, myeloid leukemia were observed to be 10.26, 4.15, 5.89, 2.81, 1.87, 5.43, 5.48, 5.24, 4.61, 3.42 and 2.65, respectively.

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is a critical component of the hematopoietic microenvironment. We summarize recent advances in our understanding of the role of HA in regulating mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelium in bone marrow (BM) and their crosstalk within the hematopoietic microenvironment. HA not only determines the volume, hydration, and microfluidics of the BM interstitial space, but also, via interactions with specific receptors, regulates multiple cell functions including differentiation, migration, and production of regulatory factors. The effects of HA are dependent on the polymer size and are influenced by the formation of complexes with other molecules. In healthy BM, HA synthases and hyaluronidases form a molecular network that maintains extracellular HA levels within a discrete physiological window, but HA homeostasis is often perturbed in pathological conditions, including hematological malignancies. Recent studies have suggested that HA synthases may have functions beyond HA production and contribute to the intracellular regulatory machinery.

METHODS: TMA system was established by moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase and 2 specific primers firstly, and then its stability and repeatability were compared at different storage temperatures by the correlation change of HCV RNA amplification curve. The sensitivity difference between TMA and RT-PCR was evaluated by amplifying a group of 10-fold diluted HCV RNA samples which were transcribed in vitro. A total of 101 serums of chronic HCV infected patients were measured by TMA system and RT-PCR to observe the positive rate and their correlation. Linear correlation and linear regression were used to observe the correlation of the two methods. RESULTS: TMA system was successfully established. TMA system was not stable when stored at 20 degrees C (placed for 24 hours only), but it was stable for 6 days when stored at 4 degrees C or within 6 months when stored at -20 degrees C . Compared with RT-PCR whose reagent was made by Hunan Sansure Biotechology Corporation, TMA system showed 20 positive samples and 11 negative samples in a total of 31 samples. So was the RT-PCR kit of the Sansure Biotechology Corporation, and the concordance rate of the two methods was 100%. Advanced quantitative study of the 20 positive samples found that the two methods had good correlation and consistency (r=0.91, P<0.01). Compared with the results of RT-PCR whose reagent was made by Shanghai Kehua Bio-engineering Corporation, TMA system had 34 positive samples and 36 negative samples, while the RT-PCR technology had 32 positive samples and 38 negative samples out of 70 samples. The concordance rate of the two methods was 97.1%, with no statistical difference in the positive rate of the two methods (P>0.05). Advanced quantitative study of 29 positive samples found that the two methods had good correlation and consistency (r=0.96, P<0.01).

Most studies have linked the common functional C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene and susceptibility to AML and CML, but the results were not consistent. The aim of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. METHODS: Meta-analyses assessing the association of MTHFR C677T and A1298C variations with AML and CML were conducted. Eligible articles were identified from the PubMed and EMBASE databases. All statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager Software. RESULTS: 10 and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis about the role of C677T polymorphism on the AML and CML risks, respectively; 6 and 4 studies were included about the role of A1298C polymorphism on the AML and CML risks, respectively. Overall, both the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were significantly associated with CML risk under the recessive model (P=0.04, OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.02-1.79 for C677T and P=0.003, OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.29-3.63 for A1298C). In addition, the risk of CML was higher in 1298CC genotype carriers than in 1298AA genotype carriers (P=0.004, OR=2.17, 95%=1.28-3.69). Conversely, the overall data failed to indicate a significant association of C677T or A1298C polymorphisms with AML risk under any model. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence that C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are risk factors for CML risk.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

B-cell lymphomas frequently (dys)regulate BCR signalling and thus take advantage of this pre-existing pathway for B-cell proliferation and survival. This has recently been underscored by clinical trials demonstrating that small molecules (fosfamatinib, ibrutinib, idelalisib) inhibiting BCR-associated kinases (SYK, BTK, PI3K) have an encouraging clinical effect. Here we describe the current knowledge of the specific aspects of BCR signalling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and normal B cells. Multiple factors can contribute to BCR pathway (dys)regulation in these malignancies and the activation of 'chronic' or 'tonic' BCR signalling. In lymphoma B cells, the balance of initiation, amplitude and duration of BCR activation can be influenced by a specific immunoglobulin structure, the expression and mutations of adaptor molecules (like GAB1, BLNK, GRB2, CARD11), the activity of kinases (like LYN, SYK, PI3K) or phosphatases (like SHIP-1, SHP-1 and PTEN) and levels of microRNAs. We also discuss the crosstalk of BCR with other signalling pathways (NF-kappaB, adhesion through integrins, migration and chemokine signalling) to emphasise that the 'BCR inhibitors' target multiple pathways interconnected with BCR, which might explain some of their clinical activity.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Risk factors for cancer-related cognitive dysfunction include young age at diagnosis, treatment with cranial irradiation, use of parenteral or intrathecal methotrexate, female sex, and pre-existing comorbidities. Limiting use and reducing doses and volume of cranial irradiation while intensifying chemotherapy have improved survival and reduced the severity of cognitive dysfunction, especially in leukemia. Nonetheless, problems in core functional domains of attention, processing speed, working memory and visual-motor integration continue to compromise quality of life and performance. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology and assessment of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction, the impact of treatment changes for prevention, and the broad strategies for educational and pharmacological interventions to remediate established cognitive dysfunction following childhood cancer. The increased years of life saved after childhood cancer warrants continued study toward the prevention and remediation of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction, using uniform assessments anchored in functional outcomes.","['(c) The Author 2014.

We have used primary CLL cells and CLL-derived MEC-1 cells transfected with empty (mock cells) or proMMP-9-encoding (MMP-9 cells) lentiviral vectors. The constitutive (pro)MMP-9 expression in mock cells and primary CLL cells was similar, whereas in MMP-9 cells, expression resembled that of CLL cells incubated with proMMP-9. In xenograft models, in NOD/SCID mice, MMP-9-MEC-1 transfectants showed significantly reduced homing to bone marrow and spleen compared with mock cells. Likewise, incubation of primary CLL cells with proMMP-9, before injection into mice, inhibited their homing to these organs. This inhibition was specific, dose-dependent, and observed in all CLL tested, independently of prognostic markers or disease stage. Additionally, the MMP-9 catalytic activity was only partially involved, as the inactive mutant proMMP-9MutE had a partial effect. MMP-9 cells also showed impaired migration in vitro, which was reverted by reducing (pro)MMP-9 expression with siRNAs. CLL migration thus requires optimal (pro)MMP-9 expression levels, below or above which migration is hampered. Biochemical analysis of the (pro)MMP-9 effect indicated that MMP-9 cells or primary CLL cells incubated with proMMP-9 had reduced activation of migration regulatory molecules, including RhoAGTPase, Akt, ERK, and FAK. In contrast, p190RhoGAP (RhoA inhibitor) and PTEN (Akt/ERK/FAK inhibitor) were up-regulated in MMP-9 cells. Reduction of (pro)MMP-9 expression by siRNAs restored RhoA activity and diminished PTEN levels. Our results reveal a novel function for (pro)MMP-9 in modulating signaling pathways leading to CLL cell arrest. Therefore, local high (pro)MMP-9 expression may contribute to malignant cell retention in lymphoid organs and disease progression.",['(c) 2014 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Bailon, Elvira', 'Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Van den Steen, Philippe', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Bailon E', 'Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Van den Steen P', 'Opdenakker G', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Enzyme Precursors/*biosynthesis', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterografts', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/*enzymology/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'PTEN', 'RhoA', 'lymphoid organs']",2014/08/01 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/08/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['96/2/185 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.3HI0913-521R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2014 Aug;96(2):185-99. doi: 10.1189/jlb.3HI0913-521R.,96,10.1189/jlb.3HI0913-521R [doi],"['Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain;', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain;', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain;', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium; and.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium; and.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain; agarciapardo@cib.csic.es.']",,,,['J Leukoc Biol. 2014 Aug;96(2):164-6.

The mode of action of CP on cancer cells is attributed to its property of releasing free radicals which, at the same time, has the potential to damage liver and kidney cells. The tissue-specific toxicity of CP to the kidneys is well documented. However, there is a paucity of literature on systemic toxicity and also the amelioration of such effect. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the damage caused by CP and its modulation by using the antioxidant capacity of curcumin (CMN, a natural polyphenolic compound) in Wistar rats. METHODS: We evaluated the ameliorative effect of CMN (200 mg/kg body weight, b.w.) on the toxicity of CP in rat liver. Oxidative stress biomarkers, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants were evaluated for assessing the mitigatory potential of CMN against CP-induced toxicity. RESULTS: A single dose of CP (7 mg/kg b.w.) caused marked hepatic damage. CP caused a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and protein carbonyl (PC) content. Pretreatment of rat with CMN significantly restored the LPO levels and PC content. It also replenished the CP-induced modulatory effects on altered enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in liver. CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrated that the role of oxidative stress is detrimental in systemic toxicity induced by CP and suggest a mitigatory effect of CMN on CP-induced hepatotoxicity in rat.",['Copyright (c) 2014 IMSS.

Despite these advances, several issues, mostly centering on approaches to improve post-transplant survival while minimizing transplant-related mortality, continue to present significant challenges. Advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of MDS have made it feasible to construct clinically useful risk models that integrate prognostic genes with conventional risk parameters for better selection of patients likely to benefit from hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Abeta42 is neurotoxic and can activate microglial cells. These cells in turn migrate toward senile (neuritic) plaques and help to clear Abeta deposits through an endocytotic mechanism. It is of potential significance to characterize the Abeta42 receptors that mediate microglia chemotaxis and Abeta42 uptake. We found that the transcript of the chemerin receptor CMKLR1 was upregulated in the brain of AD patients and in mouse brain tissue following systemic LPS administration. CMKLR1 and Abeta42 colocalized in hippocampus and cortex of AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice. Moreover, Abeta42 bound specifically to CMKLR1 in stably transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells (CMKLR1-RBL), suggesting that CMKLR1 is a receptor for Abeta42. Abeta42 induced migration of primary microglia, the mouse microglial cell line N9, and CMKLR1-RBL cells, but not untransfected RBL-2H3 cells. Mechanistic studies showed that Abeta42 induced CMKLR1-dependent cell migration through activation of the ERK1/2, PKA, and Akt pathways, but not Ca2+ mobilization.

Here, we describe a transcriptomic analysis of NHPs that survived lethal EBOV infection, compared to NHPs that did not survive. It has been previously demonstrated that anticoagulant therapeutics increase the survival rate in EBOV-infected NHPs, and that the characteristic transcriptional profile of immune response changes in anticoagulant-treated NHPs. In order to identify transcriptional signatures that correlate with survival following EBOV infection, we compared the mRNA expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from EBOV-infected NHPs that received anticoagulant treatment, to those that did not receive treatment. We identified a small set of 20 genes that are highly confident predictors and can accurately distinguish between surviving and non-surviving animals. In addition, we identified a larger predictive signature of 238 genes that correlated with disease outcome and treatment; this latter signature was associated with a variety of host responses, such as the inflammatory response, T cell death, and inhibition of viral replication. Notably, among survival-associated genes were subsets of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by (1) CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, (2) tumor protein 53, and (3) megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 and myocardin-like protein 2.

RUNX transcription factors regulate a broad spectrum of RNA Polymerase (Pol II) transcribed genes important for lineage commitment but also regulate RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) driven ribosomal gene expression, thus coordinating control of cellular identity and proliferation. In this study, using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical approaches we show that the principal RUNX co-factor, CBFbeta, associates with nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) during mitosis to negatively regulate RUNX-dependent ribosomal gene expression. Of clinical relevance, we establish for the first time that the leukemogenic fusion protein CBFbeta-SMMHC (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain) also associates with ribosomal genes in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes to promote and epigenetically sustain regulation of ribosomal genes through RUNX factor interactions.

The second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (SMAC, also termed DIABLO) mimetic, birinapant, promotes extrinsic apoptosis in AML cells. SMAC mimetics induce cleavage of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins, leading to stabilization of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-inducing kinase (MAP3K14, also termed NIK) and activation of non-canonical NF-kappaB signalling. To enhance the therapeutic potential of SMAC mimetics in AML, we investigated the regulation and role of ARC in birinapant-induced apoptosis. We showed that birinapant increases ARC in AML and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Downregulation of MAP3K14 by siRNA decreased ARC levels and suppressed birinapant-induced ARC increase. Reverse-phase protein array analysis of 511 samples from newly diagnosed AML patients showed that BIRC2 (also termed cIAP1) and ARC were inversely correlated. Knockdown of ARC sensitized, while overexpression attenuated, birinapant-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ARC knockdown in MSCs sensitized co-cultured AML cells to birinapant-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that ARC is regulated via BIRC2/MAP3K14 signalling and its overexpression in AML or MSCs can function as a resistant factor to birinapant-induced leukaemia cell death, suggesting that strategies to inhibit ARC will improve the therapeutic potential of SMAC mimetics.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Mak, Po Y', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Carter, Bing Z']","['Mak PY', 'Mak DH', 'Ruvolo V', 'Jacamo R', 'Kornblau SM', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Carter BZ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NOL3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '6O4Z07B57R (birinapant)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*physiology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Muscle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",['NOTNLM'],"['BIRC2', 'MAP3K14', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'apoptosis repressor with caspase', 'birinapant']",2014/08/01 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/08/01 06:00'],"['2014/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13054 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Nov;167(3):376-84. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13054.

Since the regenerative capacity of normal haematopoietic stem cells is limited by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and DNA double-strand breaks, we speculated that DNA damage might also constrain leukaemic self-renewal and malignant haematopoiesis. Here we show that the histone methyl-transferase MLL4, a suppressor of B-cell lymphoma, is required for stem-cell activity and an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukaemia harbouring the MLL-AF9 oncogene. Deletion of MLL4 enhances myelopoiesis and myeloid differentiation of leukaemic blasts, which protects mice from death related to acute myeloid leukaemia. MLL4 exerts its function by regulating transcriptional programs associated with the antioxidant response. Addition of reactive oxygen species scavengers or ectopic expression of FOXO3 protects MLL4(-/-) MLL-AF9 cells from DNA damage and inhibits myeloid maturation. Similar to MLL4 deficiency, loss of ATM or BRCA1 sensitizes transformed cells to differentiation, suggesting that myeloid differentiation is promoted by loss of genome integrity.

Here we report an eIF4A RNA helicase-dependent mechanism of translational control that contributes to oncogenesis and underlies the anticancer effects of silvestrol and related compounds. For example, eIF4A promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects against murine and human leukaemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5' untranslated region (UTR) sequences such as the 12-nucleotide guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, superenhancer-associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5' UTRs of select cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase.",,"['Wolfe, Andrew L', 'Singh, Kamini', 'Zhong, Yi', 'Drewe, Philipp', 'Rajasekhar, Vinagolu K', 'Sanghvi, Viraj R', 'Mavrakis, Konstantinos J', 'Jiang, Man', 'Roderick, Justine E', 'Van der Meulen, Joni', 'Schatz, Jonathan H', 'Rodrigo, Christina M', 'Zhao, Chunying', 'Rondou, Pieter', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Kelliher, Michelle A', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Porco, John A Jr', 'Pelletier, Jerry', 'Ratsch, Gunnar', 'Wendel, Hans-Guido']","['Wolfe AL', 'Singh K', 'Zhong Y', 'Drewe P', 'Rajasekhar VK', 'Sanghvi VR', 'Mavrakis KJ', 'Jiang M', 'Roderick JE', 'Van der Meulen J', 'Schatz JH', 'Rodrigo CM', 'Zhao C', 'Rondou P', 'de Stanchina E', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Kelliher MA', 'Speleman F', 'Porco JA Jr', 'Pelletier J', 'Ratsch G', 'Wendel HG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A/*metabolism', 'Female', '*G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']",,,2014/08/01 06:00,2014/09/25 06:00,['2014/08/01 06:00'],"['2013/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['nature13485 [pii]', '10.1038/nature13485 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2014 Sep 4;513(7516):65-70. doi: 10.1038/nature13485.

Recently, several studies have demonstrated that H3K9 methylation negatively regulates the type I interferon response. RESULTS: We report the application of EHMT1 and EHMT2 specific chemical inhibitors to sensitize CML cell lines to interferon and imatinib treatments. Inhibition of EHMT1 and EHMT2 with BIX01294 enhances the cytotoxicity of IFNalpha2a in four CML cell lines, K562, KCL22, BV173 and KT1 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay shows that BIX01294 treatment enhances type I interferon response by reducing H3K9me2 at the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes. Additionally, BIX01294 treatment augments IFNalpha2a- and imatinib-mediated apoptosis in CML cell lines. Moreover, our data suggest that the expression level of EHMT1 and EHMT2 inversely correlates with the type I interferon responsiveness in CML cell lines.

Mutations in FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA provide prognostic information and have been integrated into clinical diagnostics and clinical practice. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing studies have given insight into AML pathogenesis. These insights are leading to refined prognostic stratification and suggest differentially tailored treatment based on integrated genetic profiles.

In the present study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the mechanism involved in the apoptosis was investigated in human lymphoma U937 cell. When the U937 cells were treated with SP-A and SP-B for 24h at different concentrations, evidence of apoptotic features, including increase in DNA fragmentation and changes in nuclear morphology, were obtained. SP-B showed maximum potency to induce apoptosis, while SP-A was less potent. Apoptosis was also determined by increase in the fraction of sub-G1 cells and Annexin V-FITC staining cells. SP-A and SP-B induced apoptosis was accompanied by significant increase in the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-treatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), significantly inhibited the SP-A and SP-B mediated apoptosis, suggesting a vital role of ROS involved in the lethality of both agents. Moreover, SP-A and SP-B treatment resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and Fas, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. In addition Bid activation and the release of cytochrome-c to the cytosol was also observed. In this study, we suggest that a marked induction of intracellular ROS mediated mitochondrial pathway and the Fas plays a role in the SP-A and SP-B induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data provides further insights of the mechanism of action of SP-A and SP-B and their potential application as novel chemotherapeutic agents.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In many cells, such as the RBL-2H3 cell line, inhibition of FAAH activity reduces the observed uptake, indicating that the enzyme regulates uptake by controlling the intra- : extracellular AEA concentration gradient. However, in other FAAH-expressing cells, no such effect is seen. It is not clear, however, whether these differences are methodological in nature or due to properties of the cells themselves. In consequence, we have reinvestigated the role of FAAH in gating the uptake of AEA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effects of FAAH inhibition upon AEA uptake were investigated in four cell lines: AT1 rat prostate cancer, RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukaemia, rat C6 glioma and mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. Semi-quantitative PCR for the cells and for a rat brain lysate confirmed the expression of FAAH. No obvious expression of a transcript with the expected molecular weight of FLAT was seen. FAAH expression differed between cells, but all four could accumulate AEA in a manner inhibitable by the selective FAAH inhibitor URB597. However, there was a difference in the sensitivities seen in the reduction of uptake for a given degree of FAAH inhibition produced by a reversible FAAH inhibitor, with C6 cells being more sensitive than RBL-2H3 cells, despite rather similar expression levels and activities of FAAH. The four cell lines all expressed FABP5, and AEA uptake was reduced in the presence of the FABP5 inhibitor SB-FI-26, suggesting that the different sensitivities to FAAH inhibition for C6 and RBL2H3 cells is not due to differences at the level of FABP-5. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: When assayed using the same methodology, different FAAH-expressing cells display different sensitivities of uptake to FAAH inhibition.",,"['Bjorklund, Emmelie', 'Blomqvist, Anders', 'Hedlin, Joel', 'Persson, Emma', 'Fowler, Christopher J']","['Bjorklund E', 'Blomqvist A', 'Hedlin J', 'Persson E', 'Fowler CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Fabp5 protein, rat)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocannabinoids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Eye Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rats']",,,2014/08/01 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2014/08/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0103479 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-04670 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 31;9(7):e103479. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0103479. eCollection 2014.,9,10.1371/journal.pone.0103479 [doi],"['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiation Sciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",PMC4117496,,20140731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NMO prognosis is worse compared with multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Autoimmune Diseases Working Party (ADWP) conducted a retrospective survey to analyze disease outcome following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study assessed the efficacy and safety of ASCT in 16 patients suffering from refractory NMO reported to the EBMT registry between 2001 and 2011. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were successfully mobilized with cyclophosphamide (Cy) and G-CSF, one with G-CSF alone. All patients received an unmanipulated autologous peripheral blood stem cell graft, after conditioning with BEAM plus anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n = 9 patients), thiotepa-Cy (n = 3) or Cy (200 mg/kg) plus ATG (n = 4). After a median follow-up of 47 months, three of 16 cases were progression and treatment free, while in the remaining 13 patients further treatments were administered for disability progression or relapse after ASCT. Altogether, relapse-free survival at three and five years was 31% and 10%, respectively, while progression-free survival remained 48% at three and five years. CONCLUSIONS: In these NMO patients, highly resistant to conventional treatment, ASCT allows for temporary control of the disease, despite a tendency to progress or relapse in the long term.","['(c) The Author(s), 2014.']","['Greco, Raffaella', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Oliveira, Maria Carolina', 'Badoglio, Manuela', 'Burman, Joachim', 'Piehl, Fredrik', 'Hagglund, Hans', 'Krasulova, Eva', 'Simoes, Belinda Pinto', 'Carlson, Kristina', 'Pohlreich, David', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Saccardi, Riccardo', 'Comi, Giancarlo', 'Mancardi, Gian Luigi', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Farge, Dominique']","['Greco R', 'Bondanza A', 'Oliveira MC', 'Badoglio M', 'Burman J', 'Piehl F', 'Hagglund H', 'Krasulova E', 'Simoes BP', 'Carlson K', 'Pohlreich D', 'Labopin M', 'Saccardi R', 'Comi G', 'Mancardi GL', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Ciceri F', 'Farge D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mult Scler,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",9509185,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuromyelitis Optica/*surgery', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods', '*Registries', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Neuromyelitis optica', 'autologous stem cell transplantation', 'disease outcome']",2014/08/01 06:00,2016/04/05 06:00,['2014/08/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1352458514541978 [pii]', '10.1177/1352458514541978 [doi]']",ppublish,Mult Scler. 2015 Feb;21(2):189-97. doi: 10.1177/1352458514541978.

METHODS: We prospectively analysed the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of donor-recipient pairs and the KIR typing of the donors in 97 CML patients to address the predictive roles of NK cells in relapse undergoing T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with class I ligands for the donor-inhibitory KIR gene exhibited decreased molecular and haematologic relapse rates (P=0.003 and P=0.015, respectively). There was a significantly reduced risk of molecular and haematologic relapse in patients with HLA-C1C2 or C2C2 who accepted donors with KIR2DS1 or in patients with HLA-Bw4 who accepted donors with KIR3DS1 ('recipient with relevant KIR ligand for donor-activating KIR', n=25), compared with the remaining transplants (n=72, P=0.009 and P=0.009, respectively). In addition, the presence of class I ligand in the recipients of donor-activating KIR contributed to a decreased relapse rate in patients lacking class I ligand in the recipient of donor-inhibitory KIR (P=0.04 and P=0.03, respectively).

Most studies performed to evaluate the treatment of various diseases were mostly focused on the increase of life expectancy regardless of the QoL and treatment issues. Furthermore, fatigue is one of the most common and distressing side effects of cancer and treatments related to it, which can affect a patient's QoL, and be followed by many problems. This study was designed and implemented with the aim to determine the factors affecting the QoL and fatigue in patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional correlation descriptive-analytical study. One hundred and fifteen patients with leukemia referred to Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital were enrolled in the study through convenient sampling method. To collect data, a three-part questionnaire was used: The first part was related to demographic characteristics and disease-related data and the second part was the fatigue check list and the third part was the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) related to QoL. The data were analyzed after collection and coding through Software SPSS version 18 and descriptive and analytical statistics (analysis of variance test, independent t test, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficient) with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant correlation between QoL in Physical Component Summary with gender (P = 0.03), educational level (P = 0.09), and marital status (P = 0.004), Also there was a significant correlation between QoL in Mental Component Summary with educational level (P = 0.01) and economic status (P = 0.02). Findings showed that there was a significant correlation between fatigue and marital status (P = 0.005). But statistically there was no significant correlation between demographic variables such as age, educational level, and employment status with patients' fatigue. Spearman correlation coefficient showed that there was a significant correlation between fatigues with pain (P = 0.005). Also findings revealed the statistically significant correlation between fatigues with economic status (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: According to the present results, it seems that some demographic factors affect QoL and significant relationship exists between them. Fatigue in patients with leukemia dramatically affects their QoL. Therefore, it is important for medical staff to pay attention to demographics and fatigue in leukemic patients in order to improve their QoL and help them to organize their activities to promote health and QoL.",,"['Musarezaie, Amir', 'Khaledi, Firuz', 'Esfahani, Homayoon Naji', 'Ghaleghasemi, Tahere Momeni']","['Musarezaie A', 'Khaledi F', 'Esfahani HN', 'Ghaleghasemi TM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Educ Health Promot,Journal of education and health promotion,101593794,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'fatigue', 'leukemia', 'quality of life']",2014/08/01 06:00,2014/08/01 06:01,['2014/08/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2277-9531.134778 [doi]', 'JEHP-3-64 [pii]']",epublish,J Educ Health Promot. 2014 Jun 23;3:64. doi: 10.4103/2277-9531.134778. eCollection 2014.,3,10.4103/2277-9531.134778 [doi],"['Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Department of Adult Health Nursing, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Psychiatric Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Operating Room, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Department of Adult Health Nursing, Isfahan, Iran.']",PMC4113984,,20140623,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined our institution's incidence of invasive aspergillosis among patients who received remission-induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia to evaluate the potential benefits of primary antimould prophylaxis. METHODS: We conducted this retrospective cohort study at a Canadian tertiary care centre. From the central pharmacy registries, we retrieved records for all adult patients for whom remission-induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia was prescribed between 2008 and 2010. We retrieved clinical, microbiologic, pathologic and radiologic data from the patients' medical charts. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of probable or proven invasive aspergillosis up to 180 days after resolution of aplasia. RESULTS: We retrieved records for 123 patients with acute leukemia. Twenty-two of these patients did not receive the prescribed chemotherapy and were excluded from the analysis. Of the 101 patients included, 77 (76.2%) had acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, 136 courses of chemotherapy were administered, with more than 1 course administered to 26 (25.7%) of the 101 patients. In 9 of the patients (8.9%; 95% confidence interval 4.2%-16.2%), invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed (3 proven and 6 probable cases) a median of 19 (range 11-34) days after initiation of chemotherapy. In 7 (78%) of these 9 patients, invasive aspergillosis occurred during the first course of chemotherapy. Three patients died within the first year after diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.

Although many signaling pathways are involved in its antitumor mechanism, a detailed investigation of the transforming growth factor beta-bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway has not been performed. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A microarray containing 113 genes associated with the pathway was used to screen important molecules that participate in the antitumor effects of ATO. The expression levels of the inhibitors of DNA binding-2 (ID2) in 4 different types of cancer cells were determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting. Human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line Eca109 and pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC3 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting ID2 and scrambled control siRNA. Cell proliferation was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. RESULTS: Eighteen upregulated and 12 downregulated genes were identified. After verification at the transcriptional and translational levels in 4 different cancer cells, ID2 was identified as an ATO antitumor-associated protein. In addition, specific silencing of ID2 could enhance ATO-induced cell proliferation inhibition in cancer cells.

In this article we present the results of an analysis of the biodistribution data obtained from a cohort of patients with extensive bone marrow involvement, baseline cytopenias, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma or CLL expressing the CD20 antigen, who had failed at least one prior regimen, and had evidence of persistent disease were included in this analysis; however, only 38 of them completed the treatment. Semiquantitative analysis of the biodistribution was performed using regions of interest over the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and sacrum. The observed interpatient variability including higher liver uptake in four patients is discussed. RESULTS: No severe solid organ toxicity was observed at the maximum administered activity of 1184 MBq (32 mCi) Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. After accounting for differences in marrow involvement, patients with CLL exhibit comparable biodistributions to those with B-NHL. We found that the estimated sacral marrow uptake on 48 h images in patients with bone marrow involvement may be an indicator of bone marrow involvement. There was no correlation between tumor visualization and response to treatment. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the imaging step is not critical when the administered activity is below 1184 MBq (32 mCi). However, our analysis confirms that the semiquantitative imaging data can be used to identify patients at risk for liver toxicity when higher doses of Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan are used. Patients with CLL can have excellent targeting of disease by In-ibritumomab tiuxetan, indicating potential efficacy in this patient population.",,"['Matesan, Manuela', 'Rajendran, Joseph', 'Press, Oliver W', 'Maloney, David G', 'Storb, Rainer F', 'Cassaday, Ryan D', 'Pagel, John M', 'Oliveira, George', 'Gopal, Ajay K']","['Matesan M', 'Rajendran J', 'Press OW', 'Maloney DG', 'Storb RF', 'Cassaday RD', 'Pagel JM', 'Oliveira G', 'Gopal AK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/*surgery/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/*surgery/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sacrum/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole Body Imaging']",,,2014/07/31 06:00,2015/05/28 06:00,['2014/07/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MNM.0000000000000172 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2014 Nov;35(11):1132-42. doi: 10.1097/MNM.0000000000000172.,35,10.1097/MNM.0000000000000172 [doi],"['Departments of aRadiology bMedicine, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington Medical Center cClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington dDepartment of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, MGH Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",PMC4169733,,,,,,,"['K12 CA076930/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '632 R01CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA044991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA184039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12CA076930/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 78902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS608174'],,,,,,,,,

The short latencies of acute myeloid leukemias occurring in nonirradiated mice engineered with PU.1 conditional knockout or knockdown alleles suggest that once both copies of PU.1 have been lost any other steps involved in leukemogenesis occur rapidly. Yet, spontaneous acute myeloid leukemias have not been reported in mice heterozygous for a PU.1 knockout allele, an observation that conflicts with the understanding that the PU.1 codon 235 mutation is spontaneous. Here we describe experiments that show that the lack of spontaneous leukemia in PU.1 heterozygous knockout mice is not due to insufficient monitoring times or mouse numbers or the genetic background of the knockout mice. The results reveal that spontaneous leukemias that develop in mice of the mixed 129S2/SvPas and C57BL/6 background of knockout mice arise by a pathway that does not involve biallelic PU.1 mutation.

Lamivudine has been the first and commonly used nucleoside analog to inhibit HBV replication; however, prolonged therapy has been associated with an increased risk for drug-resistant mutations and mortality rates. Entecavir, a deoxyguanosine analog, offers several advantages over lamivudine for the treatment of HBV reactivation following chemotherapy while exhibiting more potent antiviral activity and a lower resistance rate. METHODS: Herein, we report rapid and sustained suppression of polychemotherapy-related HBV reactivation by entecavir administered as a prompt antiviral therapy in the cases of two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and invasive ductal carcinoma. A review of the literature is discussed. RESULTS: Entecavir produced a rapid and sustained suppression of polychemotherapy-related HBV reactivation as a prompt antiviral therapy in the cases of two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and invasive ductal carcinoma.

However, somewhat small sample sizes can hinder full discovery of new knowledge and limit interpretation of data. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reported by children and adolescents in responses to 2 interview questions during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and compare their responses by age, gender, risk group, and time in treatment through a quantitative content analysis approach. METHODS: Children and adolescents (N = 150) were asked 2 validated questions in pediatric patients receiving treatment for ALL: ""What makes a good day for you?"" and ""How has being sick been for you?"" over 6 treatment time points. Interview data were coded analyzed quantitatively. RESULTS: Code frequencies differed significantly by age, gender, risk group, and time in treatment. Adolescents had a greater focus on being with friends, and females generally reported more codes representing negative experiences. Children and adolescents reported being affected by symptoms resulting from cancer treatment. Some adolescents described that being sick positively changed their lives and viewed their illness as a new life experience. CONCLUSION: The 2 proposed questions are feasible to use clinically to assess HRQOL in children and adolescents with ALL, and the qualitative codes from their descriptions can be used to identify factors affecting HRQOL of children and adolescents with leukemia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses can use these 2 questions to assess the HRQOL of children and adolescents during and following treatment for ALL.",,"[""Momani, Tha'er G"", 'Mandrell, Belinda N', 'Gattuso, Jami S', 'West, Nancy K', 'Taylor, Stephanie L', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Momani TG', 'Mandrell BN', 'Gattuso JS', 'West NK', 'Taylor SL', 'Hinds PS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Perception', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2014/07/31 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2014/07/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000174 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2015 Jan-Feb;38(1):49-58. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000174.,38,10.1097/NCC.0000000000000174 [doi],"[""Author Affiliations: Division of Nursing Research, St Jude Children's Research Hospital (Mr Momani; Mss Gattuso, West, and Taylor; and Dr Mandrell); and College of Nursing, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis (Mr Momani and Dr Mandrell); and Children's National Medical Center (Dr Hinds) and School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, George Washington University, Washington, DC (Dr Hinds).""]",PMC4258166,,,,,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS599756'],,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that 803 individuals of both sexes, who were residents of Belem in the Brazilian State of Para, were not infected with XMRV. METHODS: Individuals were divided into 4 subgroups: healthy individuals, individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), individuals infected with human T-lymphotrophic virus, types 1 or 2 (HTLV-1/2), and individuals with prostate cancer. XMRV infection was investigated by nested PCR to detect the viral gag gene and by quantitative PCR to detect pol.

However, it still remains unclear how Dok2 functions in regulation of transcription of hematopoietic genes. To address this issue, we knocked-down Dok2 mRNA in mouse erythroleukemia cells which highly express Dok2 intrinsically. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse erythroleukemia cells were transfected with Dok2 siRNA for 24 h and gene expression of erythroid differentiation-related genes, such as GATA binding protein 1 (Gata1), Kruppel-like factor 1 (Klf1), alpha-globin and beta-globin were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among the tested genes, expression of Klf1 exhibited a 1.94-fold increase when compared to the control 24 h after transfection. Immunocytochemistry and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Dok2 protein localizes in the nucleus and binds to the promoter region of Klf1 gene. CONCLUSION: Dok2 is able to control Klf1 expression by transcriptional regulation through directly binding to its promoter region.","['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Tanaka, Yuka', 'Kulkeaw, Kasem', 'Inoue, Tomoko', 'Tan, Keai Sinn', 'Nakanishi, Yoichi', 'Shirasawa, Senji', 'Sugiyama, Daisuke']","['Tanaka Y', 'Kulkeaw K', 'Inoue T', 'Tan KS', 'Nakanishi Y', 'Shirasawa S', 'Sugiyama D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Dok2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Dok2', 'KIf1', 'Mouse erythroleukemia cells', 'docking protein 2', 'erythropoiesis']",2014/07/31 06:00,2014/11/12 06:00,['2014/07/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['34/8/4561 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Aug;34(8):4561-7.,34,,"['Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Research and Development of Next Generation Medicine, Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Research and Development of Next Generation Medicine, Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Research and Development of Next Generation Medicine, Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Research and Development of Next Generation Medicine, Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan ds-mons@yb3.so-net.ne.jp.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Characteristics of six human leukemia cell lines -Kasumi-1, NB-4, MOLM-13, MV-4-11, K562, and Jurkat cells-were investigated using multiple color analysis of surface antigen expression and comparative analysis of gene expression. RESULTS: Differentiation states of Kasumi-1 and MOLM-13 cells are colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage equivalent cells to myeloblasts with comparatively high Growth factor independent-1(GFI1) and Transcription factor PU.1 (PU.1) expression, respectively. NB4 and MV-4-11 express high levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (CEBPalpha) and differentiate from myeloblasts to pro-monocytes and myeloblasts, respectively. K562 cells are colony-forming units-erythroid equivalent cells to erythroblasts, with the highest expression of GATA-binding factor 2 (GATA2), GATA1 and Friend of gata-1 (FOG1).

Antigen-presenting cells, when activated, increase the expression of IDO, which results in the suppression of subsequent immune reaction. A novel IDO inhibitor, Toho-1, was explored for its applicability to immunotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of Toho-1 on antigen presentation and antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-inducing ability of leukemia plasmacytoid dendritic cell line PMDC05, which was established in our laboratory. RESULTS: While antigen presentation-associated molecules in PMDC05 cells were increased by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma, IDO mRNA and protein expression were also enhanced. Such treatment of PMDC05 cells in combination with Toho-1 enhanced the antigen-presenting and CTL-inducing ability of PMDC05 cells.

METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 49907 (Alliance) randomly assigned women >/= 65 years old with stages I-III breast cancer to standard adjuvant chemotherapy or capecitabine. We reviewed data from 329 women who participated in the quality of life companion study CALGB 70103 and completed the Physical Health Subscale of the Older American Resources and Services Questionnaire. This questionnaire captures data on 14 comorbid conditions and the degree to which each interferes with daily activities. A comorbidity burden score was computed by multiplying the total number of conditions by each condition's level of interference with function. Outcomes were grade 3 to 5 toxicity, TTR, and OS. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between comorbidity and toxicity, and Cox proportional hazards models for TTR and survival. RESULTS: Number of comorbidities ranged from 0 to 10 (median 2); the comorbidity burden score ranged from 0 to 25 (median 3). The most common conditions were arthritis (58%) and hypertension (55%). Comorbidity was associated with shorter OS, but not with toxicity or TTR.

Initially, it was the finding that the level of somatic hypermutations in rearranged IG heavy-chain genes could define two CLL subtypes associated with a different clinical course that drew attention. As the years ensued, this not only continued to hold strong, but also revealed an unprecedented BcR restriction (aptly coined as ""stereotypy""), thus cementing the idea that antigenic elements select the leukemic clones. With all this in mind, in the present review, we focus on the CLL BcR IG, a molecule that clearly lies at the heart of disease pathogenesis, and attempt to distil from past and emerging biologic knowledge the most relevant aspects in the context of the immunogenetics of CLL, while at the same time provoking questions that remain unanswered. We juxtapose CLL with mutated BcR IGs against CLL with unmutated BcR IGs due to their striking clinicobiologic differences; however, when considering ontogeny, common derivation of the two mutational subtypes cannot be excluded.

These cells self-renew via distinct signaling pathways and can transition between the two states in the presence of appropriate growth factors. Manipulation of signaling pathways has therefore allowed the isolation of novel pluripotent cell types such as Fibroblast growth factor, Activin and BIO-derived stem cells and IESCs. However, the effect of cell seeding density on pluripotency remains unexplored. In this study, we have examined whether mESCs can epigenetically regulate E-cadherin to enter a primed-like state in response to low cell seeding density. We show that low density seeding in the absence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces decreased apoptosis and maintenance of pluripotency via Activin/Nodal, concomitant with loss of E-cadherin, Signal transducer and activator of transcription phosphorylation, and chimera-forming ability. These cells, E-cadherin negative proliferating stem cells (ENPSCs) can be reverted to a naive phenotype by addition of LIF or forced E-cadherin expression. However, prolonged culture of ENPSCs without LIF leads to methylation of the E-cadherin promoter (ENPSC(M)), which cannot be reversed by LIF supplementation, and increased histone H3K27 and decreased H3K4 trimethylation. Transcript analysis of ENPSC(M) revealed a primed-like phenotype and their differentiation leads to enrichment of neuroectoderm cells. The generation of ENPSCs is similar to tumorigenesis as ENPSCs exhibit transcript alterations associated with neoplasia, hyperplasia, carcinoma, and metastasis. We therefore describe a novel cell model to elucidate the role of E-cadherin in pluripotency and to investigate epigenetic regulation of this gene during mESC differentiation and tumor metastasis.",['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],"['Hawkins, Kate', 'Keramari, Maria', 'Soncin, Francesca', 'Segal, Joe M', 'Mohamet, Lisa', 'Miazga, Natalie', 'Ritson, Sarah', 'Bobola, Nicoletta', 'Merry, Catherine L R', 'Ward, Christopher M']","['Hawkins K', 'Keramari M', 'Soncin F', 'Segal JM', 'Mohamet L', 'Miazga N', 'Ritson S', 'Bobola N', 'Merry CL', 'Ward CM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadherins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Activin', 'E-cadherin', 'Embryonic stem cells', 'LIF', 'Methylation', 'Nodal', 'Promoter']",2014/07/31 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1790 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2014 Nov;32(11):2869-79. doi: 10.1002/stem.1790.,32,10.1002/stem.1790 [doi],"['Stem Cell Research Group, The University of Manchester, Core Technology Facility, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,['G0701165/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Its mechanism of action is thought to involve reactivation of genes implicated in differentiation and transformation, as well as induction of DNA damage by trapping DNA methyltranferases (DNMT) to DNA. We demonstrate for the first time that base excision repair (BER) recognizes 5-azadC-induced lesions in DNA and mediates repair. We find that BER (XRCC1) deficient cells are sensitive to 5-azadC and display an increased amount of DNA single- and double-strand breaks. The XRCC1 protein co-localizes with DNMT1 foci after 5-azadC treatment, suggesting a novel and specific role of XRCC1 in the repair of trapped DNMT1. 5-azadC-induced DNMT foci persist in XRCC1 defective cells, demonstrating a role for XRCC1 in repair of 5-azadC-induced DNA lesions. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition prevents XRCC1 relocation to DNA damage sites, disrupts XRCC1-DNMT1 co-localization and thereby efficient BER. In a panel of AML cell lines, combining 5-azadC and Olaparib cause synthetic lethality. These data suggest that PARP inhibitors can be used in combination with 5-azadC to improve treatment of MDS and AML.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014.

A secondary Ph at relapse is of clinical importance because it provides a therapeutic target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors along with or in replacement of chemotherapy. We describe a case of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after HCT that developed a BCR-ABL1 translocation along with erythrophagocytosis by blasts as a secondary change at the time of relapse. The progression of this patient's myeloid neoplasm from myelodysplastic syndrome to AML to relapsed AML after HCT was accompanied by a stepwise cytogenetic evolution: A deletion 20q abnormality subsequently acquired a deletion 7q and, finally, at relapse after HCT, a secondary Ph was gained. The relationship between the secondary Ph and the erythrophagocytosis by blasts is not clear. We review the possible pathogenesis and cytogenetic associations of erythrophagocytosis by blasts, a rare feature in acute leukemias.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Since most antibodies are bivalent, higher affinity recognition can be achieved through avidity effects in which a construct containing two or more copies of the ligand engages both arms of the immunoglobulin simultaneously. This can be achieved routinely by immobilizing antibody ligands at high density on solid surfaces, such as ELISA plates, but there is surprisingly little literature on scaffolds that routinely support bivalent binding of antibody ligands in solution, particularly for the important case of human IgG antibodies. Here we show that the simple strategy of linking two antigens with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer long enough to span the two arms of an antibody results in higher affinity binding in some, but not all, cases. However, we found that the creation of multimeric constructs in which several antibody ligands are displayed on a dextran polymer reliably provides much higher affinity binding than is observed with the monomer in all cases tested. Since these dextran conjugates are simple to construct, they provide a general and convenient strategy to transform modest affinity antibody ligands into high affinity probes. An additional advantage is that the antibody ligands occupy only a small number of the reactive sites on the dextran, so that molecular cargo can be attached easily, creating molecules capable of delivering this cargo to cells displaying antigen-specific receptors.",,"['Morimoto, Jumpei', 'Sarkar, Mohosin', 'Kenrick, Sophia', 'Kodadek, Thomas']","['Morimoto J', 'Sarkar M', 'Kenrick S', 'Kodadek T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptidomimetics)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Clone Cells', 'Dextrans/*chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/chemistry/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Peptides/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Peptidomimetics/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation']",,,2014/07/31 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/07/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc500226j [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2014 Aug 20;25(8):1479-91. doi: 10.1021/bc500226j.

Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a metabolite of arachidonic acid (AA), is produced by B-CLL and contributes to their survival. The aim of the present study was to analyze the activity of the oxidative cascade of PUFAs in B-CLL. Purified B cells from patients and normal B CD5 positive cells were subjected to flow cytometry, Western-blot and RT-qPCR analyses. LTB4 plasma and intracellular concentrations were determined by ELISA. Our results showed that aggressive B-CLL tumor cells, i.e. cells with an annual proliferation index above 2, over-expressed calcium-dependent and calcium-independent phospholipases A2 (cPLA2-alpha and iPLA2-beta, respectively), 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) and leukotriene A4 hydroxylase (LTA4H). Intracellular LTB4 levels were lower in the most aggressive cells than in cells with a smaller proliferation index, despite equivalent plasma levels, and lower expression of cytochrome P450 4F3A (CYP4F3A), one major enzyme involved in LTB4 inactivation. Since BLT2, a LTB4 membrane receptor was also more often expressed on aggressive tumor cells, and since a BLT2 inhibitor significantly impaired B-CLL viability in vitro, we propose that LTB4 was efficiently trapped onto BLT2 present on aggressive tumors, thereby eliciting an autocrine response. Taken together our results demonstrate a major deregulation of the pathway leading to LTB4 synthesis and degradation in B-CLL cells, and provide a framework for understanding how these modifications promote cell survival and proliferation, especially in the most aggressive BCLL.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Adverse events in otherwise successful clinical trials caused by proto-oncogene activation due to vector integration hamper their application. MLV and MLV-based vectors integrate near strong enhancers, active promoters, and transcription start sites (TSS) through specific interaction of MLV integrase (IN) with the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, accounting for insertional mutagenesis. We identified a BET-interaction motif in the C-terminal tail of MLV IN conserved among gammaretroviruses. By deletion of this motif or a single point mutation (INW390A), BET-independent MLV (BinMLV) were engineered. BinMLV vectors carrying INW390A integrate at wild-type efficiency, with an integration profile that no longer correlates with BET chromatin distribution nor with the traditional markers of MLV integration.

In this study we aimed to confirm ALDOB as a binding protein of the S region of the HbsAg (HBs) and to investigate the function and involved mechanism between its interactions during HCC development. Our results demonstrated that both of exogenous and endogenous ALDOB proteins bind to HBs and colocalize in the cytoplasm in vitro. The coexistence of HBs and ALDOB inhibit apoptosis of cisplatin-induced HepG2 cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed the coexistence of HBs and ALDOB enhance the phosphorylations of AKT and its downstream of GSK-3beta (phosphorylation); decreased expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bid, Bim, and Puma; and increased expression of the prosurvival proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 in HepG2 cells.

Our aim was to identify the fusion partner on chromosome 10q21 and to characterize the precise nucleotide sequence of the chromosomal breakpoint. METHODS: Cytogenetic and molecular-cytogenetic techniques, chromosome microdissection, next generation sequencing, long-range PCR and direct Sanger sequencing were used to map the chromosomal translocation. RESULTS: Using a combination of cytogenetic and molecular approaches, we mapped the t(3;10)(q26;q21) to the single nucleotide level, revealing a fusion of the MECOM gene (3q26.2) and C10orf107 (10q21.2).

Similar to the other Pim kinases (Pim-1 and Pim-2), Pim-3 is involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and protein synthesis. Although Pim-3 is expressed in normal vital organs, it is overexpressed particularly in tumor tissues of endoderm-derived organs, including the liver, pancreas, and colon. Silencing of Pim-3 expression can retard in vitro cell proliferation of hepatocellular, pancreatic, and colon carcinoma cell lines by promoting cell apoptosis. Pim-3 lacks the regulatory domains similarly as Pim-1 and Pim-2 lack, and therefore, Pim-3 can exhibit its kinase activity once it is expressed. Pim-3 expression is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by transcription factors (e.g., Ets-1) and post-translational modifiers (e.g., translationally-controlled tumor protein), respectively. Pim-3 could promote growth and angiogenesis of human pancreatic cancer cells in vivo in an orthotopic nude mouse model.

Stimulation with retinoic acid leads to the recruitment of UTX-containing complexes to HOX genes, which results in demethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 and concomitant methylation of histone H3 lysine 4. Here, we show that UTX interacts with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and that this interaction is essential for proper differentiation of leukemic U937 cells in response to retinoic acid. UTX occupies the promoters of several RAR target genes and regulates their transcriptional output by modulating ASH2L complex recruitment. Overexpression of UTX in promyelocytic NB4 cells results in enhanced cellular differentiation upon retinoic acid treatment.

Both diseases represent a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders primarily affecting older adults, with treatment strategies ranging from supportive care to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Although selected older adults can benefit from intensive therapies, as a group they experience increased treatment-related morbidity, are more likely to relapse, and have decreased survival. Age-related outcome disparities are attributed to both tumor and patient characteristics, requiring an individualized approach to treatment decision making beyond consideration of chronologic age alone. Selection of therapy for any individual requires consideration of both disease-specific risk factors and estimates of treatment tolerance and life expectancy derived from evaluation of functional status and comorbidity. Although treatment options for older adults are expanding, clinical trials accounting for the heterogeneity of tumor biology and aging are needed to define standard-of-care treatments for both disease groups. In addition, trials should include outcomes addressing quality of life, maintenance of independence, and use of health care services to assist in patient-centered decision making.

This study investigated the framework by which histone marks influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and, surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci. Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together, our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA methylation and define targets of this regulation.",,"['Putiri, Emily L', 'Tiedemann, Rochelle L', 'Liu, Chunsheng', 'Choi, Jeong-Hyeon', 'Robertson, Keith D']","['Putiri EL', 'Tiedemann RL', 'Liu C', 'Choi JH', 'Robertson KD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (PRC1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",,,2014/07/30 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/07/30 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['2215 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2215 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Aug 15;5(15):6338-52. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2215.,5,,"['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",PMC4171634,,,,,['GEO/GSE56539'],,"['F31 CA171727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA163054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA108961/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Various DLBCL cells were exposed to panobinostat and BEZ235 alone or together after which apoptosis and signaling/survival pathway perturbations were monitored by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Genetic strategies defined the functional significance of such changes, and xenograft mouse models were used to assess tumor growth and animal survival. RESULTS: Panobinostat and BEZ235 interacted synergistically in ABC-, GC-, and double-hit DLBCL cells and MCL cells but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Synergism was associated with pronounced AKT dephosphorylation, GSK3 dephosphorylation/activation, Mcl-1 downregulation, Bim upregulation, increased Bcl-2/Bcl-xL binding, diminished Bax/Bak binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1, increased gammaH2A.X phosphorylation and histone H3/H4 acetylation, and abrogation of p21(CIP1) induction. BEZ235/panobinostat lethality was not susceptible to stromal/microenvironmental forms of resistance. Genetic strategies confirmed significant functional roles for AKT inactivation, Mcl-1 downregulation, Bim upregulation, and Bax/Bak in synergism. Finally, coadministration of BEZ235 with panobinostat in immunocompromised mice bearing SU-DHL4-derived tumors significantly reduced tumor growth in association with similar signaling changes observed in vitro, and combined treatment increased animal survival compared with single agents. CONCLUSIONS: BEZ235/panobinostat exhibits potent anti-DLBCL activity, including in poor-prognosis ABC- and double-hit subtypes, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Synergism is most likely multifactorial, involving AKT inactivation/GSK3 activation, Bim upregulation, Mcl-1 downregulation, enhanced DNA damage, and is operative in vivo.

We examined the association of pre-diagnostic BMI with overall and NHL-specific survival in the multiethnic cohort (MEC) study of African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Latinos, and Caucasians. METHODS: MEC participants free of NHL at cohort entry and diagnosed with NHL during follow-up were included in the analyses (n = 1,331). BMI was based on self-reported weight and height at cohort entry and after 6.1 years of cohort entry. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) with BMI as time-varying exposure in relation to all-cause and NHL-specific mortality while adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: The mean age at NHL diagnosis was 70.5 (range 45-89) years. After a mean follow-up of 4.3 +/- 3.5 years, 667 deaths including 450 NHL-specific deaths occurred. In multivariable models, obese patients (BMI >/=30.0 kg/m(2)) had higher all-cause (HR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.13-1.87) and NHL-specific (HR 1.77, 95 % CI 1.30-2.41) mortality compared with patients with high-normal BMI (22.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). For overweight patients (BMI = 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)), the respective HRs were 1.21 (95 % CI 0.99-1.49) and 1.36 (95 % CI 1.06-1.75). Cases with low-normal BMI (<22.5 kg/m(2)) experienced a significant 45 % higher all-cause and a 40 % higher NHL-specific mortality. After stratification by NHL type, the adverse effect of BMI was stronger for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma than for diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.

Ara-GTP is subsequently incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. METHODS: In the present study, we developed a novel ara-G-resistant variant (CEM/ara-G) of human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM, and elucidated its mechanism of ara-G resistance. The cytotoxicity was measured by using the growth inhibition assay and the induction of apoptosis. Intracellular triphosphate concentrations were quantitated by using HPLC. DNA synthesis was evaluated by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA. Protein expression levels were determined by using Western blotting. RESULTS: CEM/ara-G cells were 70-fold more ara-G-resistant than were CEM cells. CEM/ara-G cells were also refractory to ara-G-mediated apoptosis. The transcript level of human Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1 was lowered, and the protein levels of deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase were decreased in CEM/ara-G cells. The subsequent production of intracellular ara-GTP (21.3 pmol/107 cells) was one-fourth that of CEM cells (83.9 pmol/107 cells) after incubation for 6 h with 10 muM ara-G. Upon ara-G treatment, ara-G incorporation into nuclear and mitochondrial DNA resulted in the inhibition of DNA synthesis of both fractions in CEM cells. However, DNA synthesis was not inhibited in CEM/ara-G cells due to reduced ara-G incorporation into DNA.

There is marked evidence that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is involved in the pathogenesis of leukemia and therapies that target this axis are under development. The present study aimed to increase the efficacy of a DNA-based bcr-abl vaccine by simultaneously immunizing mice with a plasmid carrying the whole SDF-1alpha gene. Bcr-abltransformed 12B1 cells were used to challenge the mice. These cells have the oncogenic potential to induce both leukemia following intravenous inoculation and lymphoma-type solid tumors after subcutaneous inoculation. Administering an SDF1 carrying plasmid together with the bcr-abl vaccine resulted in increased survival following a challenge with subcutaneously administered 12B1 cells, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, there was a difference when the animals that developed subcutaneous tumors were only taken into consideration. In doubly-treated mice, significantly more mice failed to develop solid tumors than mice that had only received the bcr-abl vaccine. By contrast, the occurrence of fatal leukemia was significantly higher in the mice that were treated with the SDF-1 plasmid, regardless of whether they were immunized with the bcr-abl-vaccine. No humoral or cellular immune responses against SDF1 were detected in the treated mice, which suggested that the changes in oncogenic potential of 12B1 cells were due to the activity of SDF-1 itself.",,"['Lucansky, Vincent', 'Krmencikova-Fliegl, Monika', 'Stanek, Libor', 'Vonka, Vladimir']","['Lucansky V', 'Krmencikova-Fliegl M', 'Stanek L', 'Vonka V']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/therapy/veterinary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Vaccines, DNA/immunology/therapeutic use']",,,2014/07/30 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2014.2425 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2014 Oct;10(4):2116-22. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2014.2425.

The TRP cation channel, TRPM7 (subfamily M, member 7), is a ubiquitous, Ca(2)(+) and Mg(2)(+)-permeant ion channel that is unique in that it is an ion channel and a serine/threonine kinase. TRPM7 has been associated with cell proliferation, survival and development and thus correlated with growth and progression of several types of tumor cells, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, retinoblastoma and leukemia. Increased TRPM7 expression in human breast and pancreatic cancer tissues also correlates with clinicopathological parameters, such as tumor grade, the Ki-67 proliferation index and patient survival. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we focus on recent advancements in knowledge of aberrant TRPM7 channel function and its contribution to tumor progression and angiogenesis. This includes crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways. The role of TRPM7 in tumor development, particularly in regard to its channel function mediating both Ca(2)(+) and Mg(2)(+) influx as well as its kinase activity is also addressed. In addition, we will discuss its role in the stem cell and cancer stem cell, as well as its potential as tumor drug target. EXPERT OPINION: Better understanding of the structure, function and regulation of TRPM7 channel, as well as its complex crosstalk with other oncogenic signals in tumor cells will be essential to ensure rational use of treatment and development of new combinatory therapeutic possibilities.",,"['Zhou, Weiqiang', 'Guo, Shanchun', 'Xiong, Zhigang', 'Liu, Mingli']","['Zhou W', 'Guo S', 'Xiong Z', 'Liu M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TRPM7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Survival Rate', 'TRPM Cation Channels/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['TRPM7', 'cancer', 'cancer stem cells', 'ion channel', 'oncogenesis', 'tumor angiogenesis']",2014/07/30 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/07/30 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2014.940894 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2014 Oct;18(10):1177-96. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2014.940894.

Since xenograft models using human cell lines to examine drug response are not correlated with the clinical outcomes observed in patients, a xenograft model using primary human cells has been used as a more appropriate model with which to minimize this problem. Although bone marrow (BM) cells from patients are often regarded as superior sources to establish xenograft models due to the high frequency of stem cell populations, there is a fatal drawback; only small volumes can be obtained and used for the generation of the leukemic xenograft model. Indeed, longevity of AML characteristics, as well as sufficient stem cells in the xenograft model, should be guaranteed to analyze the therapeutic response to a drug. Therefore, we examined whether leukapheresed peripheral blood (LPB) consists of reliable leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and ALDHdimexpressing CD34+CD38- cells, and functions in grafting human AML with virulence compared to that of BM. LPB cells showed an advantage for the xenograft mouse model with AML cell homing, engraftment and a high human ALDHdim-expressing CD34+CD38- cell population, suggesting an alternative cell source to BM. Overall, this xenograft model using LPB offers the possibility of overcoming the small volume limitation of BM and prevents individual variation by using a single LPB sample.

The anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody HH1 was conjugated to the bifunctional chelator p-SCN-Bn-DOTA and labelled with the beta-particle emitting radionuclide 177Lu creating the radio-immunoconjugate (RIC) 177Lu-DOTA-HH1 (177Lu-HH1, trade name Betalutin). The present toxicity study was performed prior to initiation of clinical studies with 177Lu-HH1. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nude mice with or without tumor xenografts were treated with 50 to 1000 MBq/kg 177Lu- HH1 and followed for clinical signs of toxicity up to ten months. Acute, life threatening bone marrow toxicity was observed in animals receiving 800 and 1000 MBq/kg 177Lu-HH1. Significant changes in serum concentrations of liver enzymes were evident for treatment with 1000 MBq/kg 177Lu-HH1. Lymphoid depletion, liver necrosis and atrophy, and interstitial cell hyperplasia of the ovaries were also observed for mice in this dose group. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 177Lu-DOTA-HH1 was well tolerated at dosages about 10 times above those considered relevant for radioimmunotherapy in patients with B-cell derived malignancies.The toxicity profile was as expected for RICs.

Unfortunately, the probability of finding an HLA matched donor is limited. An alternative technique is PGD combined with HLA matching, which offers the possibility of selecting unaffected embryos that are HLA compatible with the sick child, with the aim of possible use of stem cells from the resulting baby in future. Since the first successful report for Fanconi anaemia a decade ago, the therapeutic success of this technique was reported in a few cases and for a limited number of disorders. Here, we report full recovery of 44 sick children who received HSCT from healthy infants conceived after pre-implantation HLA matching for the following 10 indications; beta-thalassaemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Fanconi anaemia, sickle cell anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Glanzmann's thrombasthaenia, Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and mucopolysaccharidosis type I. No serious complications were observed among recipients and donors. Graft failure occurred in four children with beta-thalassaemia where a second HSCT was planned.

However, its contribution to the development of childhood leukemia remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed point mutations of RUNX1 gene in children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from Iraq and Jordan. PROCEDURE: Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples were collected from 178 patients of Arab Asian ethnicity (aged </=17 years) newly diagnosed with AML: 145 samples from Iraq and 33 samples from Jordan. Direct DNA sequencing was performed on six genes including RUNX1 gene (exons 3-8). RESULTS: RUNX1 point mutations were identified in 10 (5.6%) of 178 patients. One patient possessed biallelic mutations of RUNX1 gene. C-terminal area was the predominant site of RUNX1 mutations (eight in C-terminal and two in N-terminal). Patients with RUNX1 mutations were significantly older than those with wild-type of the gene. Additionally, AML M0 subtype was more frequently found in patients with RUNX1 mutations. Both RUNX1 mutations and RAS mutations were identified in 4 of 10 children. Three patients with RUNX1 mutation had FLT3-ITD. On the other hand, 36 (21.4%) and 25 (14.9%) of 168 patients with wild-type of the gene had a RAS mutation and FLT3-ITD, respectively. Eight of 10 patients with RUNX1 mutations died of hematological relapse. CONCLUSION: The incidence of RUNX1 mutations in Arab Asian children and adolescents with AML was 5.6%. Further studies are required to clarify whether RAS mutations contribute to the development of pediatric AML associated with RUNX1 mutations.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","[""Al-Kzayer, Lika'a Fasih Y"", 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Al-Jadiry, Mazin Faisal', 'Al-Hadad, Salma Abbas', 'Uyen, Le T N', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Abdulkadhim, Jaafar M H', 'Al-Shujairi, Tariq Abadi', 'Matti, Zead Ismael I K', 'Hasan, Janan Ghalib', 'Al-Abdullah, Hussam M Salih', 'Inoshita, Toshi', 'Kamata, Minoru', 'Sughayer, Maher A', 'Madanat, Faris F', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Al-Kzayer LF', 'Sakashita K', 'Al-Jadiry MF', 'Al-Hadad SA', 'Uyen le TN', 'Liu T', 'Matsuda K', 'Abdulkadhim JM', 'Al-Shujairi TA', 'Matti ZI', 'Hasan JG', 'Al-Abdullah HM', 'Inoshita T', 'Kamata M', 'Sughayer MA', 'Madanat FF', 'Koike K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arabs', 'Asians/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Point Mutation']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'C-terminal/N-terminal', 'FTA', 'MDS', 'RAS', 'RUNX1/AML1']",2014/07/30 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/07/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25151 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Nov;61(11):1980-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25151.

These molecules can sometimes be used to diagnose or follow treatment of tumours or as a target for different immunotherapies. The 5T4 oncofoetal glycoprotein was identified by searching for shared surface molecules of human trophoblast and cancer cells with the rationale that they may function to allow survival of the foetus as a semi-allograft in the mother or a tumour in its host, potentially influencing growth, invasion or altered immune surveillance of the host. 5T4 tumour selective expression has stimulated the development of 5T4 vaccine, 5T4 antibody targeted-superantigen and 5T4 antibody-drug therapies through preclinical and into clinical studies. It is now apparent that 5T4 expression is a marker of the use (or not) of several cellular pathways relevant to tumour growth and spread. Thus 5T4 expression is mechanistically associated with the directional movement of cells through epithelial mesenchymal transition, facilitation of CXCL12/CXCR4 chemotaxis, blocking of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin while favouring non-canonical pathway signalling. These processes are highly regulated in development and in normal adult tissues but can contribute to the spread of cancer cells. Understanding the differential impact of these pathways marked by 5T4 can potentially improve existing, or aid development of novel cancer treatment strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study of circadian activity rhythms (CAR) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on continuation chemotherapy aimed to describe CAR before and after starting dexamethasone, and to determine whether fatigue was associated with less robust CAR. PROCEDURE: This was a secondary analysis of data from a multi-institutional study in which children with ALL aged 5-18 years wore an actigraph for 10 consecutive 24-hour periods, five before and five during dexamethasone therapy. CAR parameters measured by actigraphy were calculated for each 5-day period, including peak activity, MESOR, amplitude, acrophase, and circadian quotient. Fatigue was measured on study days 2, 5, 7, and 10 by parent-report and self-report for children >/= 7 years. RESULTS: Eighty-two children qualified for CAR analysis, and 87 for analysis of daily peak activity patterns and fatigue. Mean age was 8.8 +/- 3.3 years. Peak activity, MESOR, and amplitude significantly decreased during dexamethasone therapy. Children on high-dose dexamethasone (8 or 12 mg/m(2)/d) had significantly higher (better, or more robust) values of several CAR parameters than those on low-dose (6 mg/m(2)/d). There was a significant trend of decreasing daily pattern of peak activity during dexamethasone therapy only. Fatigue increased across the study and was associated with decreasing CAR peak activity, MESOR, and amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone initiation was associated with a decrease in several CAR parameters, and a significant decrease in the trend of daily peak activity. Fatigue was associated with less robust CAR.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Rogers, Valerie E', 'Zhu, Shijun', 'Ancoli-Israel, Sonia', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Rogers VE', 'Zhu S', 'Ancoli-Israel S', 'Hinds PS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circadian Rhythm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Sleep/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['actigraphy', 'adolescents', 'cancer', 'children', 'circadian rhythm', 'fatigue']",2014/07/30 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/07/29 06:00'],"['2014/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25147 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Nov;61(11):1986-91. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25147.

Bcl-xL can be inhibited by the BH3-mimetic ABT-737. In vitro, ABT-737 can induce apoptosis of cancer cells, and its activity is potentiated by Mcl-1 inactivation. Herein, we assessed the sensitivity of human ovarian tumor nodes to ABT-737 when combined with carboplatin, which can indirectly inhibit Mcl-1. Fresh samples from 25 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) who were chemo-naive and had undergone surgery were prospectively exposed ex vivo to ABT-737 +/- carboplatin. The treatment effect was studied on sliced tumor nodes by assessment of cleaved-caspase 3 immunostaining. We also studied the association between baseline Bcl-2 family protein expression (via immunohistochemistry) and the response of nodes to treatment. ABT-737 induced apoptosis as a single agent but its efficacy was not improved by the addition of carboplatin. Bim was frequently expressed (20/25) and its absence or low expression was associated with the absence of response to ABT-737, p value = 0.019 by Fisher's test and sensitivity = 93%, (95% confidence interval, 66-100). Moreover, we observed that in tumors in which Bim was expressed, a low expression of phospho-Erk1/2 or Mcl-1 improved the proportion of responses. This pilot study showed that ABT-737 has promise as monotherapy for HGSOC in a specific subgroup of tumors. Bim, Mcl-1, and phospho-Erk1/2 appeared to be relevant biomarkers that could be used for the selection of patients in the design of clinical trials using Navitoclax (an orally available compound related to ABT-737).",['(c) 2014 UICC.'],"['Lheureux, Stephanie', ""N'Diaye, Monique"", 'Blanc-Fournier, Cecile', 'Dugue, Audrey Emmanuelle', 'Clarisse, Benedicte', 'Dutoit, Soizic', 'Giffard, Florence', 'Abeilard, Edwige', 'Briand, Melanie', 'Labiche, Alexandre', 'Grellard, Jean-Michel', 'Crouet, Hubert', 'Martin, Sandrine', 'Joly, Florence', 'Poulain, Laurent']","['Lheureux S', ""N'Diaye M"", 'Blanc-Fournier C', 'Dugue AE', 'Clarisse B', 'Dutoit S', 'Giffard F', 'Abeilard E', 'Briand M', 'Labiche A', 'Grellard JM', 'Crouet H', 'Martin S', 'Joly F', 'Poulain L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nitrophenols/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Piperazines/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'Bim', 'Mcl-1', 'P-Erk', 'apoptosis', 'ovarian carcinoma']",2014/07/30 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2014/07/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29104 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Mar 1;136(5):E340-50. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29104.

The chemoimmunotherapy regimen was well tolerated. The incidence of grade III/IV mucositis during induction cycles with combined chemotherapy and rituximab was 31% and 26%, respectively. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS)/overall survival (OS) was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76-96%) in the entire cohort and 93% (95% CI, 61-99%) in patients with CNS disease.

We here asked, using the mouse myeloid leukemia WEHI3B and the renal cell carcinoma line RENCA, whether dendritic cell (DC) vaccination suffices to counterregulate TEX-induced immunosuppression and whether TEX could serve as tumor antigen for DC-loading. DC-vaccination significantly prolonged the survival time of WEHI3B-bearing mice, TEX-loaded DC (DC-TEX) being superior to lysate-loaded DC (DC-lys), even an excess of TEX not interfering with immune response induction. The superior response to DC-TEX was accompanied by an increase in WEHI3B-specific CD4+ T cells, evaluated by trogocytosis and proliferation. Similar findings accounted for DC loaded with RENCA TEX. TEX was efficiently taken-up by DC and TEX uptake supported CD11c, MHCII and IL12 upregulation in DC. Importantly, TEX was partly recruited into the MHCII-loading compartment such that ""TEX"" presentation time and recovery in T cells significantly exceeded that of tumor-lysate. Thus, TEX did not drive DC into a suppressive phenotype and were a superior antigen due to higher efficacy of TEX-presentation that is supported by prolonged persistence, preferential processing in the MHCII-loading compartment and pronounced trogocytosis by T helper cells. TEX is present in tumor patients' sera. TEX, recovered and enriched from patients' sera, might well provide an optimized, individual-specific antigen source for DC-loading and vaccination.",['(c) 2014 UICC.'],"['Gu, Xiaoyu', 'Erb, Ulrike', 'Buchler, Markus W', 'Zoller, Margot']","['Gu X', 'Erb U', 'Buchler MW', 'Zoller M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cell Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Extracts/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Exosomes/*immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Tumor Burden/immunology', 'Vaccination']",['NOTNLM'],"['antigen presentation', 'dendritic cells', 'exosomes', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia']",2014/07/30 06:00,2015/02/15 06:00,['2014/07/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29100 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Feb 15;136(4):E74-84. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29100.

RUNX1 and RUNX3 are frequently associated with leukemias, yet the basis for their involvement in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we show that Runx1;Runx3 double-knockout (DKO) mice exhibited lethal phenotypes due to bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative disorder. These contradictory clinical manifestations are reminiscent of human inherited bone marrow failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia (FA), caused by defective DNA repair. Indeed, Runx1;Runx3 DKO cells showed mitomycin C hypersensitivity, due to impairment of monoubiquitinated-FANCD2 recruitment to DNA damage foci, although FANCD2 monoubiquitination in the FA pathway was unaffected. RUNX1 and RUNX3 interact with FANCD2 independently of CBFbeta, suggesting a nontranscriptional role for RUNX in DNA repair.

CD20 is not highly expressed by CLL tumor cells, and rituximab does not have significant effectiveness in CLL unless combined with chemotherapy. Alemtuzumab targets CD52, which is much more highly expressed, and is currently the most effective agent used alone for CLL. Variability in expression of both antigens among these patients might be related to different individual therapeutic responses to mAb therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total 95 patients diagnosed with CLL and/or SLL were divided into 4 groups: (1) untreated; (2) in complete or partial remission; (3) disease in progression; and (4) diagnosed with SLL. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells included gating of the CD5(+)CD19(+) tumor population, within which mean fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with anti-CD20 or anti-CD52 antibody was measured. The resulting expression of the 2 antigens was deduced from the calibration curve using Quantum FITC particles. RESULTS: Expression of CD20 showed no significant differences among the 4 groups of patients. However, significantly greater expression of surface antigen CD52 was recorded in patient group 2 in complete or partial remission (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The residual population of CLL cells after therapy is characterized by increased surface detection of CD52. Although the exact cause of this phenomenon is unknown, our results provide a basis to consider the potential for CLL consolidation therapy using alemtuzumab.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

Here, we analyze the same model to investigate the role of genome-wide methylation in the immortalization process at different time points pre-crisis and post-crisis using high-resolution arrays. We show that over time in culture there is an overall accumulation of methylation alterations, with preferential increased methylation close to transcription start sites (TSSs), islands, and shore regions. Methylation and gene expression alterations did not correlate for the majority of genes, but for the fraction that correlated, gain of methylation close to TSS was associated with decreased gene expression. Interestingly, the pattern of CpG site methylation observed in immortal T-cell cultures was similar to clinical T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples classified as CpG island methylator phenotype positive. These sites were highly overrepresented by polycomb target genes and involved in developmental, cell adhesion, and cell signaling processes. The presence of non-random methylation events in in vitro immortalized T-cell cultures and diagnostic T-ALL samples indicates altered methylation of CpG sites with a possible role in malignant hematopoiesis.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess potential risk factors. RESULTS: Among 4,336,338 inpatient transfusion stays for elderly beneficiaries during the study period, 78 had a PTP diagnosis code recorded, an overall rate of 1.8 per 100,000 stays. PTP occurrence varied by the blood components, units transfused, and other characteristics. Significantly higher odds of PTP were found for platelet (PLT)-containing transfusions, with greater number of units transfused, as well as for elderly with histories of cardiac arrhythmias (odds ratio [OR], 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-4.93), coagulopathy (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.01-3.21), leukemia (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.07-5.26), transplant (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.41-5.09), and other conditions. CONCLUSION: Our population-based study suggests a substantially higher PTP risk with PLT-containing transfusions. The study also suggests increased PTP risk with greater number of units transfused as well as the importance of underlying health conditions and prior recipient alloimmunization for PTP occurrence among the elderly.","['Published 2014.

In AML, simultaneous expression of proliferative (FLT-3, c-KIT) and antiapoptotic genes (BCL-2), are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively assessed proliferative and antiapoptotic gene transcripts using Taqman probe chemistry in 48 adult AML patients. A stepwise Cox regression model was applied for independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Thirty-two of 48 (75%) patients achieved complete remission. At follow-up ranging from 0.5 to 57.3 months, event-free survival (EFS) was 26.9 +/- 6.3% (range, 15.5%-39.6%) and OS 34.5 +/- 7.46% (range, 20.5%-48.9%). High white blood cell count correlated with an inferior complete remission rate (P = .021). Cytogenetics and FLT-3 internal tandem duplication did not predict EFS or OS. The transcripts of FLT-3, c-KIT, and BCL-2 showed a significant linear association with each other in Pearson correlation (FLT-3 vs. c-KIT: R = 0.8234; P < .001; c-KIT vs. BCL-2: R = 0.3377; P = .01; FLT-3 vs. BCL-2: R = 0.3815; P = .007). In a validation cohort (Microarray Data Set GSE1159) of adult AML patients, the global gene expression profile depicted a similar interrelationship. Patients with a greater platelet count were associated with increased transcript levels of BCL-2 (P = .034). In univariate analysis, a high transcript level of FLT-3 and high transcript ratio of FLT-3/BCL-2 and FLT-3 and c-KIT/BCL-2 significantly predicted OS (P = .043, .028, and .028, respectively). In a stepwise Cox regression model, high FLT-3 and c-KIT/BCL-2 ratio predicted OS (HR, 2.29). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated proliferative and antiapoptotic transcripts simultaneously, and results have shown that it is the relative levels of these transcripts that determine outcome in AML patients rather than their expression in isolation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
