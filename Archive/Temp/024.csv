The variation of N-alkyl or aromatic rings were sensitive to microstructures of the DNA minor groove. Thirteen new compounds were synthesized to test their binding affinity and selectivity. The dicyanobenzimidazoles needed to synthesize the target diamidines were made via condensation/cyclization reactions of different aldehydes with different 3-amino-4-(alkyl- or phenyl-amino) benzonitriles. The final diamidines were synthesized using lithium bis-trimethylsilylamide (LiN[Si(CH3 )3 ]2 ) or Pinner methods. The newly synthesized compounds showed strong binding and selectivity to AAAGTTT compared to similar sequences AAATTT and AAAGCTTT investigated by several biophysical methods including biosensor-SPR, fluorescence spectroscopy, DNA thermal melting, ESI-MS spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics. The binding affinity results determined by fluorescence spectroscopy are in accordance with those obtained by biosensor-SPR. These small size single GC bp highly specific binders extend the compound database for future biological applications.","['(c) 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The treatment is an unpleasant experience and the children often perceive the treatment as worse than the actual disease. The aim of the present study was thus to explore the process of how healthcare professionals improved care for children undergoing sedation for intrathecal chemotherapy. METHOD: A constructivist grounded theory approach was applied and qualitative interviews with paediatricians (n = 2), anaesthetists (n = 2), paediatric nurses (n = 3) and nurse anaesthetists (n = 5). RESULTS: The theory of creating a shielding place emerged and conceptualized the pattern of behavior of healthcare professionals throughout the procedure of sedation for intrathecal chemotherapy for pediatric leukaemia. The theory explains the core category 'shielding' and the process of how healthcare professionals developed strategies to resolve their main concern: a striving to reduce discomfort and suffering induced by the procedure and the treatment. These strategies, used throughout the procedure, were; de-dramatizing, de-exposing and minimizing trespassing. CONCLUSIONS: The theory of creating a shielding place offers a greater understanding of how healthcare professionals included the child's perspective in their work and thereby enabled a more sensitive and supportive care that had an impact on both quality of care and patient safety. The results from the study contributes with theoretical knowledge that can be used for developing evidence-based care guidelines for the procedure of sedating a child with leukaemia for intrathecal chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Drug resistance greatly contributes to the poor efficacy of chemotherapy in AML treatment. Recent research indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) regulates chemotherapy resistance in malignancy. METHODS: Microarray analysis was used to screen out AML related genes, and interaction between small nucleolar RNA host gene 5(SNHG5) and miR-32, as well as that between miR-32 and DNAJB9. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and In situ hybridization(ISH) were used to determine the expression levels of SNHG5, miR-32 and DNAJB9 mRNA in AML cell lines and clinic samples. Western blot was performed to detect protein expression levels. After being treated with varying concentrations of Adriamycin(ADM), cell viability was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8(CCK8). RESULTS: We carried out a genome-wide LncRNA expression study and found SNHG5 aberrantly overexpressed in AML comparing to the donors. Knock-down of SNHG5 promoted sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapy. In addition, miR-32 was identified as the downstream target of SNHG5 and miR-32 inhibitor abrogated the inhibiting effects of downregulated SNHG5 on AML cell viability. Furthermore, inhibited SNHG5 decreased DNAJB9 expression levels by sponging miR-32. The SNHG5/miR-32/DNAJB9 axis targeted autophagy to regulate chemotherapy resistance. CONCLUSION: SHNG5 regulates chemotherapy resistance by targeting the miR-32/DNAJB9 axis in acute myeloid leukemia, which provided a novel potential target for AML and revealed an important mechanism of chemotherapy resistance.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: We evaluated second primary papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) risk among 3,175,216>/=1-year adult survivors of non-thyroid malignancies from US population-based cancer registries (2000-2015), using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Because heightened surveillance may increase detection of indolent thyroid tumors and earlier detection of advanced tumors, we examined SIRs by PTC stage and time since first cancer (latency). RESULTS: SIRs for second primary PTC (N=4333) were statistically-significantly 1.2-3.5-fold elevated overall and after 23/27 first cancer types evaluated, with generally similar risks for localized and regional/distant PTC. SIRs for regional/distant PTC (N=1501) were highest after pancreatic (SIR=3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.9-6.5) and soft tissue (SIR=4.2; 95%CI=2.8-6.2) cancers, followed by melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and larynx, kidney, and brain/central nervous system (SIRs=2.0-2.9) cancers. SIRs typically decreased with increasing latency but remained statistically-significantly elevated for regional/distant-PTC >/=5 years after diagnosis of cancers of the rectum, pancreas, lung/bronchus, soft tissue, female breast, uterine corpus, prostate, and kidney, and after melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and follicular lymphoma. Neither total nor regional/distant PTC were clearly associated with initial course of radiotherapy or chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: PTC risk was elevated after a range of first primary adult cancers but was not clearly related to treatment. Although surveillance may contribute to elevated short-term risks of PTC, longer-term elevations in regional/distant PTC may be attributable to shared risk factors.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],"['Schonfeld, Sara J', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Kitahara, Cari M']","['Schonfeld SJ', 'Morton LM', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Curtis RE', 'Kitahara CM']",,"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, MSC 9778 Bethesda, MD, 20892-9778, United States.

Several polymorphisms result in reduced MTHFR activity that causes impaired remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and abnormal MTX metabolism, especially in tissues with high turnover. Therefore, the risk of elevated plasma homocysteine as well as MTX-induced toxicities become higher with MTHFR polymorphisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 160 patients with ALL receiving MTX containing chemotherapeutic protocol, and they were genotyped for MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We also measured the plasma homocysteine level of 51 patients by the AxSYM homocysteine assay method. RESULTS: We found 68.1% CC, 26.3% CT, and 5.6% TT genotype for MTHFR C677T polymorphism and 39.3% AA, 46.9% AC, and 13.8% CC genotype for MTHFR A1298C polymorphism in patients with ALL. Our study suggested that MTX-induced mucositis and diarrhea are significantly associated with MTHFR C677T as well as MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The risk of elevated plasma homocysteine level was 5 to 6 times higher for both polymorphisms.

Especially after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), standard protocols using bone marrow aspirates fail to reliably recover sufficient cell numbers. Because MSCs are considered to contribute to processes that mainly affect the outcome after transplantation, such as an efficient lymphohematopoietic recovery, extent of graft-versus-host disease as well as the occurrence of leukemic relapse, it is of great clinical relevance to investigate MSC function in this context. Previous studies showed that MSCs can be isolated by collagenase digestion of large bone fragments of hematologically healthy patients undergoing hip replacement or knee surgeries. We have now further developed this procedure for the isolation of MSCs from hematologic patients after allogeneic HCT by using trephine biopsy specimens obtained during routine examinations. Comparison of aspirates and trephine biopsy specimens from patients after allogeneic HCT revealed a significantly higher frequency of clonogenic MSCs (colony-forming unit-fibroblast [CFU-F]) in trephine biopsy specimens (mean, 289.8 +/- standard deviation 322.5 CFU-F colonies/1 x 10(6) total nucleated cells versus 4.2 +/- 9.9; P < 0.0001). Subsequent expansion of functional MSCs isolated from trephine biopsy specimen was more robust and led to a significantly higher yield compared with control samples expanded from aspirates (median, 1.6 x 10(6); range, 0-2.3 x 10(7) P0 MSCs versus 5.4 x 10(4); range, 0-8.9 x 10(6); P < 0.0001). Using trephine biopsy specimens as MSC source facilitates the investigation of various clinical questions.","['Copyright (c) 2019 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy.

Central to Treg activation are changes in lipid metabolism that support their survival and function. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of lipid chaperones required to facilitate uptake and intracellular lipid trafficking. One family member, FABP5, is expressed in T cells, but its function remains unclear. We show that in Tregs, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of FABP5 function causes mitochondrial changes underscored by decreased OXPHOS, impaired lipid metabolism, and loss of cristae structure. FABP5 inhibition in Tregs triggers mtDNA release and consequent cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling, which induces heightened production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and promotes Treg suppressive activity. We find evidence of this pathway, along with correlative mitochondrial changes in tumor infiltrating Tregs, which may underlie enhanced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our data reveal that FABP5 is a gatekeeper of mitochondrial integrity that modulates Treg function.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, standardization of diagnostic techniques, sample acquisition and test timing are needed before minimal, also known as measurable, residual disease (MRD) quantification can be used to guide treatment decision making. Furthermore, clinical trial evidence that preemptive intervention at MRD level can alter the natural history of AML is required.

Many risks factors induce liver chronic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mulberry fruits containing polyphenols to remove free radicals and mitigate inflammation has been reported to not only against gastric cancer, melanoma and leukemia but also prevent liver injury induced by alcohol or CCl4 in previous researches. The aim of this study is to examine whether Mulberry could inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis. In animal experiment, diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was used to induce hepatic tumorgenesis. After injecting DEN, the rats treated with mulberry water extracts (MWE) had less and smaller tumor than others without MWE. Moreover, MWE reduced the serum ALT and AST, HCC marker, cleavage caspases, Ser-15-p53 and Ser46-p53 induced by DEN. Further, we observed that mulberry polyphenol extracts (MPE) inhibited the cell growth of HepG2 cell and Hep3B cell. By using flow cytometry and western blotting methods, MPE induced HepG2 cell apoptosis by increase subG1 cells and the elevated expression of caspase-3/8/9. Instead of apoptosis, MPE caused Hep3B cells autophagy by inhibiting Akt and mTOR phosphorylation.

Our previous study revealed a positive association between asymptomatic HTLV-1 infection and advanced periodontitis among elderly Japanese individuals with low levels of hematopoietic activity (reflected by reticulocyte levels). Since low hematopoietic activity has been correlated with low-grade inflammation and low-grade inflammation is associated with atherosclerosis, the status of atherosclerosis could, in turn, determine the nature of this association. METHODS: To this end, a cross-sectional study of 907 elderly Japanese individuals (aged 60-99 years), who had participated in dental health check-up during the period 2016-2018, was conducted. Advanced periodontitis was defined as periodontal pocket >/= 6.0 mm. RESULTS: Among the study population, 295 (32.5%) were found to have atherosclerosis defined as a carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) of >/= 1.1 mm. HTLV-1 infection was positively associated with advanced periodontitis in participants with atherosclerosis, but no significant associations were observed among the participants without atherosclerosis. The known risk factors' (including reticulocyte and CIMT) adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of advanced periodontitis were OR 2.01 and 95% CI 1.06-3.81 for participants with atherosclerosis and OR 0.61 and 95% CI 0.34-1.12 for participants without atherosclerosis. CONCLUSION: This study found a significant association between HTLV-1 infection and advanced periodontitis among elderly Japanese with atherosclerosis. However, this association is absent in individuals without atherosclerosis, suggesting that atherosclerosis might act as a determinant in the association between HTLV-1 infection and advanced periodontitis among elderly Japanese.",,"['Shimizu, Yuji', 'Yamanashi, Hirotomo', 'Kitamura, Masayasu', 'Furugen, Reiko', 'Iwasaki, Takahiro', 'Fukuda, Hideki', 'Hayashida, Hideaki', 'Kawasaki, Koji', 'Kiyoura, Kairi', 'Kawashiri, Shin-Ya', 'Saito, Toshiyuki', 'Kawakami, Atsushi', 'Maeda, Takahiro']","['Shimizu Y', 'Yamanashi H', 'Kitamura M', 'Furugen R', 'Iwasaki T', 'Fukuda H', 'Hayashida H', 'Kawasaki K', 'Kiyoura K', 'Kawashiri SY', 'Saito T', 'Kawakami A', 'Maeda T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3381-9288'],"['Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan. shimizu@osaka-ganjun.jp.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, Osaka, Japan. shimizu@osaka-ganjun.jp.', 'Department of General Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Community Oral Health, School of Dentistry, Asahi University, Gifu, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Community Medical Network Center, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of General Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Island and Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['18K06448/the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '17H03740/the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",['Journal Article'],20191228,England,Environ Health Prev Med,Environmental health and preventive medicine,9609642,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Atherosclerosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Carotid Intima-Media Thickness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Periodontitis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6935119,,['NOTNLM'],"['Atherosclerosis', 'Elderly', 'HTLV-1', 'Periodontitis']",2019/12/31 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2019/12/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12199-019-0836-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12199-019-0836-2 [pii]']",epublish,Environ Health Prev Med. 2019 Dec 28;24(1):81. doi: 10.1186/s12199-019-0836-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen patients treated according to the DCOG ALL-11 protocol, with a neutralizing hypersensitivity reaction to PEGasparaginase to the first PEGasparaginase doses in induction (12 patients) or during intensification after interruption of several months (6 patients) were included. ELISA was used to measure antibodies, coating with the succinimidyl succinate linker conjugated to BSA, PEGfilgrastim and Escherichia coli asparaginase, and using hydrolysed PEGasparaginase and mPEG5,000 for competition. Anti-PEG antibodies were detected in all patients (IgG 100%; IgM 67%) of whom 39% had anti-PEG antibodies exclusively. Pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies were also detected in patients who not previously received a PEGylated therapeutic (58% IgG; 21% IgM). Antibodies against the SS-linker were predominantly detected during induction (50% IgG; 42% IgM). Anti-asparaginase antibodies were detected in only 11% during induction but 94% during intensification.

As compared to the traditional cell-mediated immunity, CAR-T possesses the improved specificity of tumor antigens and independent cytotoxicity from major histocompatibility complex molecules through a monoclonal antibody in addition to the T-cell receptor. CAR-T cell has proven its effectiveness, primarily in hematological malignancies, specifically where the CD 19 CAR-T cells were used to treat B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell lymphomas. Nevertheless, there is little progress in the treatment of solid tumors despite the fact that many CAR agents have been created to target tumor antigens such as CEA, EGFR/EGFRvIII, GD2, HER2, MSLN, MUC1, and other antigens. The main obstruction against the progress of research in solid tumors is the tumor microenvironment, in which several elements, such as poor locating ability, immunosuppressive cells, cytokines, chemokines, immunosuppressive checkpoints, inhibitory metabolic factors, tumor antigen loss, and antigen heterogeneity, could affect the potency of CAR-T cells.

METHODS: This was an observational study of administrative claims from 2008 to 2017. Among individuals initiating tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for chronic myeloid leukemia or immunomodulatory drugs for multiple myeloma, we compared out-of-pocket spending, adherence, and discontinuation before and after parity among individuals in fully insured plans (subject to parity) vs self-funded plans (exempt from parity) using propensity-score weighted difference-in-differences regression models. RESULTS: Among patients initiating TKIs (N = 2082) or immunomodulatory drugs (N = 3326) there were no statistically significant differences in adherence or discontinuation associated with parity. The proportion of patients with initial out-of-pocket payments of $0 increased in fully insured plans after parity from 5.7% to 46.1% for TKIs and from 10.9% to 48.8% for immunomodulatory drugs. Relative to changes in self-funded plans, those in fully insured plans were 4.27 (95% CI = 2.20 to 8.27) times as likely to pay nothing for TKIs and 1.96 (95% CI = 1.40 to 2.73) times as likely to pay nothing for immunomodulatory drugs after parity. Similarly, the proportion paying more than $100 decreased from 30.3% to 24.7% for TKIs and 30.6% to 27.5% for immunomodulatory drugs in fully insured plans after parity. Relative to changes in self-funded plans, those in fully insured plans were 0.74 (95% CI = 0.54 to 1.01) times as likely to pay more than $100 for TKIs and 0.85 (95% CI = 0.68 to 1.06) times as likely to pay more than $100 for immunomodulatory drugs after parity. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients initiating TKIs or immunomodulatory drugs, parity was not associated with better adherence or less discontinuation of therapy but yielded decreased patient out-of-pocket payments for some patients.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

While tumor cell factors other than target expression level appear to play a role in determining the efficacy of CD3 bsAb, the identity of such factors remains largely unknown. Using a co-culture system of primary human T cells and B lymphoma cell lines, we demonstrate a range of sensitivities to CD20xCD3 bsAb that is independent of CD20 surface expression. To identify genes that modulate tumor cell sensitivity to CD3 bsAb, we employed a genome-scale CRISPR activation screen in a CD20xCD3-sensitive human B lymphoma cell line. Among the most highly enriched sgRNAs were those targeting genes with predicted effects on cell-cell adhesion, including sialophorin (SPN). Increased expression of SPN impeded tumor cell clustering with T cells, thereby limiting CD3 bsAb-mediated tumor cell lysis. This inhibitory effect of SPN appeared to be dependent on sialylated core 2 O-glycosylation of the protein. While SPN is not endogenously expressed in the majority of B cell lymphomas, it is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia. CRISPR-mediated SPN knockout in AML cell lines facilitated T cell-tumor cell clustering and enhanced CD3 bsAb-mediated AML cell lysis. In sum, our data establish that the cell cross-linking mechanism of CD3 bsAb is susceptible to subversion by anti-adhesive molecules expressed on the tumor cell surface. Further evaluation of anti-adhesive pathways may provide novel biomarkers of clinical response and enable the development of effective combination regimens for this promising therapeutic class.",,"['Decker, Corinne E', 'Young, Tara', 'Pasnikowski, Elizabeth', 'Chiu, Joyce', 'Song, Hang', 'Wei, Yi', 'Thurston, Gavin', 'Daly, Christopher']","['Decker CE', 'Young T', 'Pasnikowski E', 'Chiu J', 'Song H', 'Wei Y', 'Thurston G', 'Daly C']",,"['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, 10591, United States. christopher.daly@regeneron.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191227,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', '*Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', '*Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology']",PMC6934601,,,,2019/12/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/12/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-56670-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-56670-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Dec 27;9(1):20068. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-56670-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this heterogeneous disease are yet to be disclosed, the identification and the validation of novel actors in leukemia is of extreme importance. Here, we show that KCTD15, a member of the emerging class of KCTD ((K)potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain containing) proteins, is strongly upregulated in patients affected by B-cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and in continuous cell lines (RS4;11, REH, TOM-1, SEM) derived from this form of childhood leukemia. Interestingly, KCTD15 downregulation induces apoptosis and cell death suggesting that it has a role in cellular homeostasis and proliferation. In addition, stimulation of normal lymphocytes with the pokeweed mitogen leads to increased KCTD15 levels in a fashion comparable to those observed in proliferating leukemic cells. In this way, the role of KCTD15 is likely not confined to the B-ALL pathological state and extends to activation and proliferation of normal lymphocytes.

Analyses of molecular mechanisms underlying CRAG-mediated SRF activation revealed that CRAG has an essential role in GTPase activity, interacts with ELK1 (a co-activator of SRF), and activates SRF in an ELK1-dependent manner. Furthermore, CRAG and ELK1 interact with promyelocytic leukaemia bodies through SUMO-interacting motifs, which is required for SRF activation.

Inhibition of MYB expression or activity has been shown to suppress MLL-fusion oncoprotein-induced acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), which are among the most aggressive forms of AML, and indeed MYB transcription has been reported to be regulated by the MLL-AF9 oncoprotein. This highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism of MYB transcriptional regulation in these leukaemias. Here we have demonstrated that the MLL-AF9 fusion protein regulates MYB transcription directly at the promoter region, in part by recruiting the transcriptional regulator kinase CDK9, and CDK9 inhibition effectively suppresses MYB expression as well as cell proliferation. However, MYB regulation by MLL-AF9 does not require H3K79 methylation mediated by the methyltransferase DOT1L, which has also been shown to be a key mediator of MLL-AF9 leukemogenicity. The identification of specific, essential and druggable transcriptional regulators may enable effective targeting of MYB expression, which in turn could potentially lead to new therapeutic approaches for acute myeloid leukaemia with MLL-AF9.",,"['Cao, Lu', 'Mitra, Partha', 'Gonda, Thomas J']","['Cao L', 'Mitra P', 'Gonda TJ']",,"['School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Gallipoli Medical Research Institute, Greenslopes Private Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, TRI, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. thomas.gonda@unisa.edu.au.', 'University of South Australia Cancer Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia. thomas.gonda@unisa.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191227,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', '*Genes, myb', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC6934848,,,,2019/12/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/12/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-56426-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-56426-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Dec 27;9(1):20084. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-56426-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pediatric T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was investigated using G-banding chromosome analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The malignant cells carried a t(14;21)(q11;q22) aberration. The translocation moves the enhancer elements of TRA/TRD from band 14q11 to 21q22, a few thousands kbp downstream of OLIG1 and OLIG2, resulting in the production of both OLIG1 and OLIG2 proteins. CONCLUSION: The translocation t(14;21)(q11;q22) occurs in some pediatric T-cell lymphoblastic malignancies. Activation of both OLIG1 and OLIG2 by t(14;21)(q11;q22) in T-lymphoblasts and the ensuing deregulation of thousands of genes could explain the highly malignant disease and resistance to treatment that has characterized this small group of patients.","['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Gorunova, Ludmila', 'Johannsdottir, Inga Maria Rinvoll', 'Andersen, Kristin', 'Holth, Arild', 'Beiske, Klaus', 'Heim, Sverre']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Gorunova L', 'Johannsdottir IMR', 'Andersen K', 'Holth A', 'Beiske K', 'Heim S']",,"['Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ioannis.panagopoulos@rr-research.no.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Advisory Unit on Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (OLIG1 protein, human)', '0 (OLIG2 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC6937122,,['NOTNLM'],"['OLIG1 expression', 'OLIG2 expression', 'Pediatric T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'TRA/TRD enhancer', 'chromosome translocation t(14;21)(q11;q22)', 'unfavorable prognosis']",2019/12/29 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/12/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['17/1/41 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20166 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2020 Jan-Feb;17(1):41-48. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The timing of these events is not well understood. Moreover, it is currently unknown why the same driver gene change appears as an early event in some cancer types and as a later event, or not at all, in others. These questions have become even more topical with the recent progress brought by genome-wide sequencing studies of cancer. Focusing on mutational events, we provide a mathematical model of the full process of tumor evolution that includes different types of fitness advantages for driver genes and carrying-capacity considerations. The model is able to recapitulate a substantial proportion of the observed cancer incidence in several cancer types (colorectal, pancreatic, and leukemia) and inherited conditions (Lynch and familial adenomatous polyposis), by changing only 2 tissue-specific parameters: the number of stem cells in a tissue and its cell division frequency. The model sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of cancer by suggesting a generalized early onset of tumorigenesis followed by slow mutational waves, in contrast to previous conclusions. Formulas and estimates are provided for the fitness increases induced by driver mutations, often much larger than previously described, and highly tissue dependent. Our results suggest a mechanistic explanation for why the selective fitness advantage introduced by specific driver genes is tissue dependent.",['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Our objective was to review the clinical and pathologic features of cases with initial presentations of cord compression, subsequently diagnosed as a hematolymphoid malignancy after pathologic examination. Review of the Department of Pathology's archives revealed 15 patients who presented with spinal cord compression due to epidural hematolymphoid malignancies between 2008-2019. These cases involved five primary epidural lymphomas, including an ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma previously not reported at this site, three diffuse large B cell lymphomas, one B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, four cases of myeloid sarcoma, one case with a previous history of acute myeloid leukemia, five cases with plasma cell neoplasms and epidural lesions as the initial presentation of plasma cell myeloma, one case showing aberrant T-cell marker expression, and one case being a histiocytic sarcoma that is rarely reported in the spine. A hematolymphoid malignancy was suspected clinically or radiologically in only five of these cases. These cases represent the spectrum of hematolymphoid malignancies that can involve the epidural space and present for the first time with cord compression, resulting in clinical, radiological and pathologic diagnostic challenges. Their diagnoses require a high degree of awareness, suspicion, and thorough histologic evaluation with ancillary studies for appropriate disease classification and therapeutic intervention.

Thus, the hypermethylation of DNA is essential for the molecular pathophysiology of MDS by inactivating genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. It was documented that the 5-methylcytosine (5mc) immunostaining score of BM haematopoietic mononuclear cells is higher in MDS patients than in a normal control group, and that the prognosis of the disease significantly correlated with global DNA methylation, age and IPSS score. In our study, we analysed the immunocytochemical expression of 5mc in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells from 13 MDS patients and a control group consisting of 13 patients with anaemia of chronic disease. The immunopositivity of 5mc BM mononuclear cells was statistically significantly higher in our MDS patients than in patients with anaemia of chronic disease. In most MDS patients (11 out of 13), a higher 5mc immunopositivity of BM mono-nuclear cells (above 10%) was found.

A549 cells were divided into an untreated group (without any treatment), a scramble siRNA group (transfected with control siRNA), and a Pim-3-deficient group (transfected with Pim-3 siRNA). METHODS: Pim-3-deficient cells are the experimental sample, whereas scramble siRNA and untreated cells are the corresponding negative controls. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression levels of Pim-3 protein, the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and the expression levels of downstream target genes (p21, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Bax). Flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell cycle and apoptosis. RESULTS: In the Pim-3-deficient group, Pim-3 was downregulated, the STAT3 phosphorylation level decreased, the levels of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 decreased, but the levels of p21 and Bax increased. Meanwhile, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited (P<0.05); specifically, the G0/G1-phase cell proportion increased, whereas the S-phase cell proportion decreased and the proportion of early apoptotic cells increased significantly (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The downregulation of Pim-3 was closely related to the activation status of the lung STAT3 signaling pathway, mediated cell proliferation inhibition and induced apoptosis.","['(c) 2019 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Fan, Xiaoyue', 'Xie, Yilin', 'Zhang, Lan', 'Gao, Xianzheng', 'Han, Jing', 'Chen, Yongfang', 'Yang, Jianping', 'Li, Shenglei']","['Fan X', 'Xie Y', 'Zhang L', 'Gao X', 'Han J', 'Chen Y', 'Yang J', 'Li S']",,"['Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China cncdoc@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Adenocarcinoma of Lung/metabolism/pathology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lung cancer', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'STAT3 signaling pathway', 'provirus-integrating site']",2019/12/29 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/12/29 06:00'],"['2019/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['49/6/770 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2019 Nov;49(6):770-776.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim is to compare the BCR/ABL1 e13a2 and e14a2 transcript frequency in healthy first-degree relatives of families with CML versus individuals from families without CML antecedents. Ninety-eight healthy individuals, sorted into two groups, were studied: a group consisting of 46 first-degree relatives from families having a CML affected, and another with 52 healthy individuals from families without CML antecedents.

We observed 28 of 98 individuals positive for at least one BCR/ABL1 transcript: e14a2 was detected in 22, e13a2 in 4, and co-expression was observed in 2 subjects. The positivity rate in relatives of CML cases was 33%, whereas individuals without CML antecedents had a 25% positivity rate, showing no statistical difference.

Antibody-based therapies, such as blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamycin (IO) have led to improved outcomes. The impact of prior immunotherapy on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-Cell therapeutic efficacy and toxicity is unknown. METHODS: We describe a case series of ALL patients with prior exposure to blinatumomab or IO, who were treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory domain (NCT02772198). We then review the literature on CAR-T post antibody-based therapy with either antibodies. RESULTS: Five adult patients with B-ALL were included. Three had active disease, and two were in morphological complete remission (CR) with minimal residual disease (MRD+). Therapy before CAR-T included blinatumomab (3/5 [60 %]) and IO (3/5 [60 %]), with one patient receiving both. One patient experienced severe cytokine release syndrome and central nervous system toxicity and subsequently died. At 28 days following treatment, two patients achieved CR with MRD negativity, and two had an MRD + CR. Two patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At a median of 10 months (range, 5-26, three out of the four patients are still in CR, and one relapsed. The literature review identified a deficiency on data on the influence of blinatumumab and IO on outcomes post CAR-T therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CD19 CAR T-cell therapy after treatment with blinatumomab and/or IO in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL is feasible and results in promising response rates in this case series. Future trails should specifically address outcomes in this population.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, these cells are not derived from the ILC common progenitor, which generates other ILC subsets and is defined by the expression of the transcription factor PLZF. Here, we examined transcription factor(s) determining the fate of LTi progenitors versus non-LTi ILC progenitors. Conditional deletion of Gata3 resulted in the loss of PLZF(+) non-LTi progenitors but not the LTi progenitors that expressed the transcription factor RORgammat. Consistently, PLZF(+) non-LTi progenitors expressed high amounts of GATA3, whereas GATA3 expression was low in RORgammat(+) LTi progenitors. The generation of both progenitors required the transcriptional regulator Id2, which defines the common helper-like innate lymphoid progenitor (ChILP), but not cytokine signaling. Nevertheless, low GATA3 expression was necessary for the generation of functionally mature LTi cells. Thus, differential expression of GATA3 determines the fates and functions of distinct ILC progenitors.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis showed that roasting increased digestibility of peanuts and this trend was even more evident after BBM degradation. The eliciting properties of raw and roasted peanuts were assessed by Rat Basophil Leukemia assay in the presence of sera from peanut-allergic patients.

Recent efforts have focused on developing therapies that target specific protein products of aberrantly expressed genes. However, many of the identified proteins are difficult to target and thought to be ""undrugable"" because of structural challenges, protein overexpression, or mutations that confer resistance to therapy. A novel technology that circumvents some of these issues is the use of small molecules that stabilize secondary DNA structures present in the promoters of many potential oncogenes and modulate their transcription. METHODS: This study characterizes the in vitro activity of the G-quadruplex-stabilizing small molecule GQC-05 in AML cells. The effect of GQC-05 on three AML cell lines was analyzed using viability and apoptosis assays. GQC-05 has been shown to down-regulate MYC through G-quadruplex stabilization in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. MYC expression was evaluated through qPCR and immunoblotting in the three AML cell lines following the treatment of GQC-05. In order to identify other therapeutic agents that potentiate the activity of GQC-05, combination drug screening was performed. The drug combinations were validated using in vitro cytotoxicity assays and compared to other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. RESULTS: GQC-05 treatment of KG-1a, CMK and TF-1 cells decreased cell viability and resulted in increased DNA damage and apoptosis. Additionally, treatment of KG-1a, CMK and TF-1 with GQC-05 resulted in decreased expression of MYC mRNA and protein, with a more pronounced effect in KG-1a cells. Combination drug screening identified the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor Navitoclax as a compound that potentiated GQC-05 activity. Co-treatment with GQC-05 and Navitoclax showed a synergistic decrease in cell viability of AML cells as determined by Chou-Talalay analysis, and induced more DNA damage, apoptosis, and rapid cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity induced by GQC-05 and Navitoclax was more potent than that of Navitoclax combined with either cytarabine or doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the G-quadruplex stabilizing small molecule GQC-05 induces down regulated MYC expression and DNA damage in AML cells. Treatment with both GQC-05 with a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor Navitoclax results in increased cytotoxic activity, which is more pronounced than Navitoclax or GQC-05 alone, and more significant than Navitoclax in combination with cytarabine and doxorubicin that are currently being used clinically.",,"['Montoya, Justin J', 'Turnidge, Megan A', 'Wai, Daniel H', 'Patel, Apurvi R', 'Lee, David W', 'Gokhale, Vijay', 'Hurley, Laurence H', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Wetmore, Cynthia', 'Azorsa, David O']","['Montoya JJ', 'Turnidge MA', 'Wai DH', 'Patel AR', 'Lee DW', 'Gokhale V', 'Hurley LH', 'Arceci RJ', 'Wetmore C', 'Azorsa DO']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8538-301X'],"[""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA. justinjmontoya@email.arizona.edu."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA. justinjmontoya@email.arizona.edu.', ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.', 'Present Address: Department of Molecular & Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.', ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Tucson, AZ, USA.', ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", ""The Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', 'Present Address: Systems Oncology, Scottsdale, AZ, 85255, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191227,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (9-(dimethylaminoethoxy)ellipticine)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'G-Quadruplexes/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6935221,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Bcl-2', 'Bcl-XL', 'G-quadruplex', 'MYC', 'Navitoclax']",2019/12/29 06:00,2020/05/08 06:00,['2019/12/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6464-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6464-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Dec 27;19(1):1251. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6464-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, current matrix factorization tools fall short in handling noisy data and missing entries, both deficiencies that are often found in real-life data. RESULTS: Here, we propose DeepMF, a deep neural network-based factorization model. DeepMF disentangles the association between molecular feature-associated and sample-associated latent matrices, and is tolerant to noisy and missing values. It exhibited feasible cancer subtype discovery efficacy on mRNA, miRNA, and protein profiles of medulloblastoma cancer, leukemia cancer, breast cancer, and small-blue-round-cell cancer, achieving the highest clustering accuracy of 76%, 100%, 92%, and 100% respectively. When analyzing data sets with 70% missing entries, DeepMF gave the best recovery capacity with silhouette values of 0.47, 0.6, 0.28, and 0.44, outperforming other state-of-the-art MF tools on the cancer data sets Medulloblastoma, Leukemia, TCGA BRCA, and SRBCT. Its embedding strength as measured by clustering accuracy is 88%, 100%, 84%, and 96% on these data sets, which improves on the current best methods 76%, 100%, 78%, and 87%. CONCLUSION: DeepMF demonstrated robust denoising, imputation, and embedding ability. It offers insights to uncover the underlying biological processes such as cancer subtype discovery.

Recent advances in understanding its molecular basis have opened the way to new therapeutic strategies, including targeted therapies. However, despite an improvement in prognosis it has been documented in recent years (especially in younger patients) that allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative treatment in AML and the first therapeutic option for high-risk patients. After allo-HSCT, relapse is still a major complication, and is observed in about 50% of patients. Current evidence suggests that relapse is not due to clonal evolution, but instead to the ability of the AML cell population to escape immune control by a variety of mechanisms including the altered expression of HLA-molecules, production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, relevant metabolic changes and expression of immune checkpoint (ICP) inhibitors capable of ""switching-off"" the immune response against leukemic cells.

The leading treatment for high-risk MDS patients is azacitidine (Aza, Vidaza((R))), but a significant proportion of patients are refractory and all patients eventually relapse after an undefined time period. Therefore, new therapies for MDS are urgently needed. We present here evidence that acadesine (Aca, Acadra((R))), a nucleoside analog exerts potent anti-leukemic effects in both Aza-sensitive (OCI-M2S) and resistant (OCI-M2R) MDS/AML cell lines in vitro. Aca also exerts potent anti-leukemic effect on bone marrow cells from MDS/AML patients ex-vivo. The effect of Aca on MDS/AML cell line proliferation does not rely on apoptosis induction. It is also noteworthy that Aca is efficient to kill MDS cells in a co-culture model with human medullary stromal cell lines, that mimics better the interaction occurring in the bone marrow. These initial findings led us to initiate a phase I/II clinical trial using Acadra((R)) in 12 Aza refractory MDS/AML patients. Despite a very good response in one out 4 patients, we stopped this trial because the highest Aca dose (210 mg/kg) caused serious renal side effects in several patients.

Many cases of B-ALL harbor chromosomal translocations which are often critical determinants of prognosis. Most of them represent altered transcription factors that impact gene transcription or enhance signaling. B-ALLs harboring the mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) gene rearrangements represent aggressive, high-risk type of early childhood leukemias that are usually associated with a very poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic agents as well as new treatment strategies. The objective was to examine the vitro inhibitory effects of Scutellaria baicalensis root extract (SBE) in B-ALL cell lines with different chromosomal rearrangements and in leukemic blasts derived from patients' bone marrow (BMCs). In this study we showed that baicalin which is the main component of the SBE possess antitumor activity against all leukemic cell lines especially those with MLL and PBX1 gene rearrangements. Baicalin inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and induced cell death through caspase 3/7 activation. Moreover, baicalin treatment inhibited the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) by suppressing its phosphorylation at Y216, and upregulated the downstream mediator of the cell cycle arrest - cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). Bone marrow derived blasts from B-ALL patients also exhibited varied sensitivity towards baicalin with 72% patients sensitive to the SBE and baicalin treatment. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the anti-cancer properties of baicalin by showing its diverse mode of action which might be related to the different genetic background.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

We previously demonstrated that the imatinib-resistant CML cells (Myl-R) contained elevated Lyn activity and intracellular creatine pools compared to imatinib-sensitive Myl cells. METHODS: Stable isotope metabolic labeling, media creatine depletion, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor experiments were performed to investigate the origin of creatine pools in Myl-R cells. Inhibition and shRNA knockdown were performed to investigate the specific role of Lyn in regulating the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and creatine uptake. RESULTS: Inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump (ouabain, digitoxin), depletion of extracellular creatine or inhibition of Lyn kinase (ponatinib, dasatinib), demonstrated that enhanced creatine accumulation in Myl-R cells was dependent on uptake from the growth media. Creatine uptake was independent of the Na(+)/creatine symporter (SLC6A8) expression or de novo synthesis. Western blot analyses showed that phosphorylation of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase on Tyr 10 (Y10), a known regulatory phosphorylation site, correlated with Lyn activity. Overexpression of Lyn in HEK293 cells increased Y10 phosphorylation (pY10) of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, whereas Lyn inhibition or shRNA knockdown reduced Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pY10 and decreased creatine accumulation in Myl-R cells. Consistent with enhanced uptake in Myl-R cells, cyclocreatine (Ccr), a cytotoxic creatine analog, caused significant loss of viability in Myl-R compared to Myl cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Lyn can affect creatine uptake through Lyn-dependent phosphorylation and regulation of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump activity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These studies identify kinase regulation of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase as pivotal in regulating creatine uptake and energy metabolism in cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to investigate the possible mechanisms from the perspective of autophagy. MAIN METHODS: P-53-null leukemic cell lines Jurkat and U937 were used for the in vitro study. MDC staining was used for observation of autophagy in leukemic cells, and Western blot analysis was for determination of the expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins. Apoptosis of the leukemic cells was detected by flow cytometry. Cellular location of MDM2 was observed with immunofluorescence staining. Ubiquitination of MDM2 was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Male 6-8-week-old NOD/SCID mice were used for evaluating the effect of BBR on chemotherapy sensitivity in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: BBR induced autophagy in p53-null leukemic cells, which was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine. 3-methyladenine also inhibited BBR-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells. In addition, BBR not only decreased MDM2 mRNA expression, but also enhanced MDM2 self-ubiquitination in leukemic cells. Forced overexpression of MDM2 reversed the effect of BBR on autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, BBR promoted doxorubicin-induced autophagy and cell death in the leukemic cells and overexpression of MDM2 suppressed these effects. In vivo, BBR combined with doxorubicin achieved better therapeutic effect than doxorubicin alone. SIGNIFICANCE: MDM2 inhibits autophagy and apoptosis in leukemic cells in a p53-independent manner. BBR induces autophagy in p53-null leukemic cells through downregulating MDM2 expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which may contribute to the anti-cancer effect of BBR in leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we evaluated ADCC effect of cord blood stem cell derived CD16(+) NK cells with using anti CD47 blocking antibody. CD16(+) NK cells generated efficiently from CD34 positive cord blood cells in vitro using IL-2, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines, although it was not dose dependent. CD16(+) cells derived from CD34(+) cells in day 14 of culture efficiently increased apoptosis in ALL cells, produced INFgamma and increased CD107-a expression when used anti CD47 antibody (increased around 30-40%). Interestingly, CD16(+) NK cell cytotoxicity slightly increased in combination with macrophages against ALL cells (around 10%).

There was a statistically significant difference in knowledge and practice in post test and a significant correlation of knowledge and practice in post test, but not during pre test. Considering different aspects of care, mothers had only around 50 % knowledge which was close to 100 % post test. The study revealed that there was a significant association between knowledge with age of the child and number of the children, and in practice, association was found in gender of the child and the educational status of the mother.

We sought to evaluate safety and efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with CNL and aCML, irrespective of CSF3R mutation status. METHODS: We conducted a phase II study of ruxolitinib in 44 patients (21 CNL and 23 aCML). The primary end point was overall hematologic response rate (ORR) by the end of 6 continuous 28-day cycles for the first 25 patients enrolled. We considered a response as either partial (PR) or complete response (CR). We expanded accrual to 44 patients to increase our ability to evaluate secondary end points, including grade >/= 3 adverse events, spleen volume, symptom assessment, genetic correlates of response, and 2-year survival. RESULTS: ORR was 32% for the first 25 enrolled patients (8 PR [7 CNL and 1 aCML]). In the larger cohort of 44 patients, 35% had a response (11 PR [9 CNL and 2 aCML] and 4 CR [CNL]), and 50% had oncogenic CSF3R mutations. The mean absolute allele burden reduction of CSF3R-T618I after 6 cycles was greatest in the CR group, compared with the PR and no response groups.

Although molecular aberrations are routinely used to stratify AML patients into prognostic subgroups when receiving standard chemotherapy, the predictive value of the genetic background and co-occurring mutations remains to be assessed when using newly approved antileukemic drugs. In the present study, we retrospectively addressed the question of the predictive value of molecular events on the benefit of the addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to standard front-line chemotherapy. Using the more recent European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 risk classification, we confirmed that the benefit of GO was restricted to the favorable (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.98) and intermediate (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-1.00) risk categories, whereas it did not influence the outcome of patients within the adverse risk subgroup (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.61-1.43). Interestingly, the benefit of GO was significant for patients with activating signaling mutations (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28-0.65), which correlated with higher CD33 expression levels.

Sodium azulene sulfonate (SAS) was used to reverse the multidrug resistance of human leukemia adriamycin-resistant strain K562/A02, and the underlying mechanism was investigated. Human leukemia cell line K562 and drug-resistant cell line K562/A02 in logarithmic phase were used in this study. After 48 hours of treatment of K562/A02 cells with SAS, the intrinsic cytotoxicity of chlorogenic acid and its sensitivity to adriamycin (ADM) were determined with MTT assay. The degree of reversal was calculated. Using ADM accumulation and rhodamine 123 efflux experiments, the average fluorescence intensity of ADM and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) in chlorogenic acid-treated K562/A02 cells was determined flow cytometrically. The expressions of p-gp, t-Akt and p-Akt in K562/A02 cells were assayed using Western blotting. SAS had almost no cytotoxic effect, and the degree of inhibition was only about 20% at the highest concentration of 100 mu-M. The EC50 of MDR reversal by SAS was in the nano range (539+/-37nM), and it had a high selectivity index for normal cells (&gt;185). The accumulation of ADM in drug-resistant cells was increased significantly after treatment with 1 and 5 mu-M SAS, while the efflux of Rh123 was significantly inhibited, suggesting that SAS reversed MDR by inhibiting p-gp function. Western blotting experiments showed that SAS downregulated the expression of p-gp by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This contributed to the reversal of drug resistance.SAS effectively reverses multidrug resistance in vitro by inhibiting the function of p-gp in K562/A02 cells, through a mechanism involving downregulation of the P13K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, SAS may be a potential candidate drug for reversal of MDR.",,"['Wang, Ziwei', 'Zhou, Na', 'Zhao, Jianqi', 'Zhang, Xin']","['Wang Z', 'Zhou N', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang X']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Jilin University, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Jilin University, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun City, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun City, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190930,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Azulenes)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '82R6M9MGLP (azulene)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Azulenes/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adriamycin', 'Multidrug resistance', 'Reversal activity.', 'Sodium azulene sulfonate', 'p-glycoprotein']",2019/12/28 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/12/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2019 Sep 30;65(7):105-110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we employed a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced lung inflammation to explore the potential of laser-facilitated epicutaneous allergen-specific treatment. METHODS: Mice were sensitized against native Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract and repeatedly treated by application of depigmented D pteronyssinus extract via laser-generated skin micropores or by subcutaneous injection with or without alum. Following aerosol challenges, lung function was determined by whole-body plethysmography and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for cellular composition and cytokine levels. HDM-specific IgG subclass antibodies were determined by ELISA. Serum as well as cell-bound IgE was measured by ELISA, rat basophil leukemia cell assay, and ex vivo using a basophil activation test, respectively. Cultured lymphocytes were analyzed for cytokine secretion profiles and cellular polarization by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunization of mice by subcutaneous injection or epicutaneous laser microporation induced comparable IgG antibody levels, but the latter preferentially induced regulatory T cells and in general downregulated T cell cytokine production. This effect was found to be a result of the laser treatment itself, independent from extract application. Epicutaneous treatment of sensitized animals led to induction of blocking IgG, and improvement of lung function, superior compared to the effects of subcutaneous therapy. During the whole therapy schedule, no local or systemic side effects occurred. CONCLUSION: Allergen-specific immunotherapy with depigmented HDM extract via laser-generated skin micropores offers a safe and effective treatment option for HDM-induced allergy and lung inflammation.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The BCL-2 family includes both pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, which are structurally and functionally related, containing up to four BCL-2 homology (BH) motifs (BH1-4). There are also some nutritional factors that regulate apoptosis via the BCL-2 family proteins. In this review, the BCL-2 family proteins and their apoptosis-inducing mechanism have been discussed, along with the nutrient factors that regulate apoptosis through the BCL-2 family proteins.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Zheng, Chen', 'Liu, Ting', 'Liu, Huihui', 'Wang, Jing']","['Zheng C', 'Liu T', 'Liu H', 'Wang J']",,"['College of Animal Science and Technology, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China', 'Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Protein Pept Sci,Current protein & peptide science,100960529,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animal Feed/analysis/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/diet therapy/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/*metabolism', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diet therapy/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Nutrients/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Obesity/diet therapy/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Probiotics/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL-2 family proteins', '*apoptosis', '*lymphoma', '*nutrients', '*probiotics', '*regulation']",2019/12/28 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2019/12/28 06:00'],"['2019/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPPS-EPUB-103279 [pii]', '10.2174/1389203721666191227122252 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2020;21(8):799-806. doi: 10.2174/1389203721666191227122252.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uttarakhand, a north Himalayan state of India lacks studies of pancytopenia and the prevalent causes present in this region. Therefore, the present study was conducted to study the clinico-hematological profile of pancytopenia in a tertiary care center in the Uttarakhand, a north Himalayan state of India. It was also intended to study if these causes showed any variation from other studies done in different regions of India. Materials and Methods: The present observational study was conducted in a tertiary care institute situated in Uttarakhand state of India over a period of 1 year and 8 month from June 2017 to Feb 2019 including all the cases of pancytopenia. Results: The most common cause of pancytopenia was megaloblastic anemia (25%), followed by aleukemic leukemia and hypoplastic/aplastic anemia (19.1% each). Visceral leishmaniasis also constituted an important cause of pancytopenia in this study (11.7%). Conclusion: The study concludes that megaloblastic anemia and aleukemic leukemia are the most common cause of pancytopenia. Although leishmaniasis is considered to be non-endemic in this region, it constitutes an important cause of pancytopenia here. The clinicians, especially the physicians practicing the primary care and pathologists, should be aware of the different causes of pancytopenia present in this Himalayan region of India; therefore, delay in diagnosis can be prevented along with unnecessary investigations.",['Copyright: (c) 2019 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],"['Chandra, Harish', 'Gupta, Arvind K', 'Nath, Uttam K', 'Singh, Neha', 'Kumar, Utpal', 'Kishore, Sanjeev']","['Chandra H', 'Gupta AK', 'Nath UK', 'Singh N', 'Kumar U', 'Kishore S']",,"['Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191210,India,J Family Med Prim Care,Journal of family medicine and primary care,101610082,,,,PMC6924218,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aleukemic leukemia', 'aplastic anemia', 'leishmaniasis', 'megaloblastic anemia', 'pancytopenia']",2019/12/28 06:00,2019/12/28 06:01,['2019/12/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_539_19 [doi]', 'JFMPC-8-3944 [pii]']",epublish,J Family Med Prim Care. 2019 Dec 10;8(12):3944-3948. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_539_19. eCollection 2019 Dec.,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of flow cytometry positivity with a negative cytology - occult central nervous system disease - is not clear. In the framework of the national Campus ALL program, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of occult central nervous system disease and its impact on outcome in 240 adult patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All cerebrospinal fluid samples were investigated by conventional cytology and flow cytometry. The presence of >/=10 phenotypically abnormal events, forming a cluster, was considered as flow cytometry positivity. No central nervous system involvement was documented in 179 patients, while 18 were positive by conventional morphology and 43 were occult central nervous system disease positive. The relapse rate was significantly lower in central nervous system disease negative patients and the disease-free and overall survival were significantly longer in central nervous system disease negative patients than in those with manifest or occult central nervous system disease positive. In multivariate analysis, the status of manifest and occult central nervous system disease positivity was independently associated with a worse overall survival. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients at diagnosis flow cytometry can detect occult central nervous system disease at high sensitivity and that the status of occult central nervous system disease positivity is associated with an adverse outcome.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, an inherited bone marrow failure disorder with high risk of developing myeloid malignancies. METHODS: We did a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study in collaboration with the North American Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome Registry. We reviewed patient medical records from 17 centres in the USA and Canada. Patients with a genetic (biallelic mutations in the SBDS gene) or clinical diagnosis (cytopenias and pancreatic dysfunction) of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome who developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia were eligible without additional restriction. Medical records were reviewed between March 1, 2001, and Oct 5, 2017. Masked central review of bone marrow pathology was done if available to confirm leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosis. We describe the clinical features and overall survival of these patients. FINDINGS: We initially identified 37 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia. 27 patients had samples available for central pathology review and were reclassified accordingly (central diagnosis concurred with local in 15 [56%] cases), 10 had no samples available and were classified based on the local review data, and 1 patient was excluded at this stage as not eligible. 36 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 10 (28%) initially presented with acute myeloid leukaemia and 26 (72%) initially presented with myelodysplastic syndrome. With a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 3.9-8.4), median overall survival for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was 7.7 years (95% CI 0.8-not reached) and 0.99 years (95% CI 0.2-2.4) for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival at 3 years was 11% (95% CI 1-39) for patients with leukaemia and 51% (29-68) for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Management and surveillance were variable. 18 (69%) of 26 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome received upfront therapy (14 haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 4 chemotherapy), 4 (15%) patients received no treatment, 2 (8%) had unavailable data, and 2 (8%) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia before receiving treatment. 12 patients received treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia-including the two patients initially diagnosed with myelodysplastic who progressed- two (16%) received HSCT as initial therapy and ten (83%) received chemotherapy with intent to proceed with HSCT. 33 (92%) of 36 patients (eight of ten with leukaemia and 25 of 26 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were known to have Shwachman-Diamond syndrome before development of a myeloid malignancy and could have been monitored with bone marrow surveillance. Bone marrow surveillance before myeloid malignancy diagnosis was done in three (33%) of nine patients with leukaemia for whom surveillance status was confirmed and 11 (46%) of 24 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients monitored had a 3-year overall survival of 62% (95% CI 32-82; n=14) compared with 28% (95% CI 10-50; n=19; p=0.13) without surveillance. Six (40%) of 15 patients with available longitudinal data developed myelodysplastic syndrome in the setting of stable blood counts. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that prognosis is poor for patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia owing to both therapy-resistant disease and treatment-related toxicities. Improved surveillance algorithms and risk stratification tools, studies of clonal evolution, and prospective trials are needed to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies for leukaemia predisposition in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.

However, little is known about how this occurs at the atomic level. In this work, we examined the role that acetylation of SUMO1 plays on its binding to the phosphorylated SIMs (phosphoSIMs) of PML and Daxx. Our results demonstrate that SUMO1 binding to the phosphoSIM of either PML or Daxx is dramatically reduced by acetylation at either K39 or K46. However, acetylation at K37 only impacts binding to Daxx. Structures of acetylated SUMO1 variants bound to the phosphoSIMs of PML and Daxx demonstrate that there is structural plasticity in SUMO-SIM interactions. The plasticity observed in these structures provides a robust mechanism for regulating SUMO-SIM interactions in PML-NBs using signaling generated post-translational modifications.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Several mechanisms underlie PEA actions, among which the ""entourage"" effect, consisting of PEA potentiation of endocannabinoid signaling at either cannabinoid receptors or transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channels. Here, we report novel molecular mechanisms through which PEA controls mast cell degranulation and substance P (SP)-induced histamine release in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, a mast cell model. METHODS: RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with SP were treated with PEA in the presence and absence of a cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptor antagonist (AM630), or a diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) enzyme inhibitor (OMDM188) to inhibit the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The release of histamine was measured by ELISA and beta-hexosaminidase release and toluidine blue staining were used as indices of degranulation. 2-AG levels were measured by LC-MS. The mRNA expression of proposed PEA targets (Cnr1, Cnr2, Trpv1, Ppara and Gpr55), and of PEA and endocannabinoid biosynthetic (Napepld, Dagla and Daglb) and catabolic (Faah, Naaa and Mgl) enzymes were also measured. The effects of PEA on the activity of DAGL-alpha or -beta enzymes were assessed in COS-7 cells overexpressing the human recombinant enzyme or in RBL-2H3 cells, respectively. RESULTS: SP increased the number of degranulated RBL-2H3 cells and triggered the release of histamine. PEA counteracted these effects in a manner antagonized by AM630. PEA concomitantly increased the levels of 2-AG in SP-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, and this effect was reversed by OMDM188. PEA significantly stimulated DAGL-alpha and -beta activity and, consequently, 2-AG biosynthesis in cell-free systems. Co-treatment with PEA and 2-AG at per se ineffective concentrations downmodulated SP-induced release of histamine and degranulation, and this effect was reversed by OMDM188. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of CB2 underlies the inhibitory effects on SP-induced RBL-2H3 cell degranulation by PEA alone.

Several HH pathway inhibitors have already been approved for medical therapy of advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia with partially impressive therapeutic activity. However, de novo and acquired resistance as well as severe side effects and unexplained lack of therapeutic efficacy are major challenges that urgently call for improved treatment options with more durable responses. The recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have changed our current understanding of targeted therapy and opened up promising therapeutic opportunities including combinations of selective cancer pathway and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although HH/GLI signaling has been intensely studied with respect to the classical hallmarks of cancer, its role in the modulation of the anti-tumoral immune response has only become evident in recent studies. These have uncovered HH/GLI regulated immunosuppressive mechanisms such as enhanced regulatory T-cell formation and production of immunosuppressive cytokines. In light of these exciting novel data on oncogenic HH/GLI signaling in immune cross-talk and modulation, we summarize and connect in this review the existing knowledge from different HH-related cancers and chronic inflammatory diseases. This is to provide a basis for the investigation and evaluation of novel treatments combining immunotherapeutic strategies with approved as well as next-generation HH/GLI inhibitors. Further, we also critically discuss recent studies demonstrating a possible negative impact of current HH/GLI pathway inhibitors on the anti-tumoral immune response, which may explain some of the disappointing results of several oncological trials with anti-HH drugs.

Pretreatment risk classification represents a determinant key of type and intensity of post-remission therapy. Current evidence indicates that allo-SCT represents the treatment of choice for high and intermediate risk patients if clinically eligible, and its use is favored by increasing availability of unrelated or haploidentical donors. On the contrary, the adoption of ASCT is progressively declining, although numerous studies indicate that in favorable risk AML the relapse rate is lower after ASCT than chemotherapy. In addition, the burden of supportive therapy and hospitalization favors ASCT.

ATO-loaded sodium alginate nanoparticles (SA-ATO-NPs, SANs) were prepared by the ion crosslinking method, and then RBCM was extruded onto the surface to obtain RSANs. The average particle size of RSANs was found to be 163.2 nm with a complete shell-core bilayer structure, and the average encapsulation efficiency was 14.31%. Compared with SANs, RAW 264.7 macrophages reduced the phagocytosis of RSANs by 51%, and the in vitro cumulative release rate of RSANs was 95% at 84 h, which revealed a prominent sustained release. Furthermore, it demonstrated that RSANs had lower cytotoxicity as compared to normal 293 cells and exhibited anti-tumor effects on both NB4 cells and 7721 cells. In vivo studies further showed that ATO could cause mild lesions of main organs while RSANs could reduce the toxicity and improve the anti-tumor effects.

The efficacy of allo-SCT depends on the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. However, the prognosis of patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following allo-SCT is poor. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is utilized after allo-SCT in this setting to prevent relapse, to prolong progression free survival, to establish full donor chimerism and to restore the GvL effect in patients with hematological malignancies. Thus, there are different options for the administration of DLI in AML patients. DLI is currently used prophylactically and in the setting of an overt relapse. In addition, in the minimal residual disease (MRD) setting, DLI may be a possibility to improve overall survival. However, DLI might increase the risk of severe life-threatening complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) as well as severe infections. The transfusion of lymphocytes has been tested not only for the treatment of hematological malignancies but also chronic infections. In this context, manipulated DLI in a prophylactic or therapeutic approach are an option, e.g., virus-specific DLI using different selection methods or antigen-specific DLI such as peptide-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In addition, T cells are also genetically engineered, using both chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genetically modified T cells and T cell receptor (TCR) genetically modified T cells. T cell therapies in general have the potential to enhance antitumor immunity, augment vaccine efficacy, and limit graft-versus-host disease after allo-SCT. The focus of this review is to discuss the different strategies to use donor lymphocytes after allo-SCT. Our objective is to give an insight into the functional effects of DLI on immunogenic antigen recognition for a better understanding of the mechanisms of DLI.

This study aims to evaluate the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII((R))) and CLL. A total of 366 CLL cases and 1643 controls of the Spanish multicase-control (MCC) Spain study were included. The inflammatory potential of the diet was assessed using the energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII) based on 30 items from a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models controlling for potential confounders. Overall, a modest, non-statistically significant, positive association was observed between CLL and E-DII scores (OR for a one-unit increase in E-DII: 1.05 (CI 95%: 0.99, 1.12), p-value = 0.09 and by tertiles: ORT2vsT1: 1.20 (CI 95%: 0.90, 1.59); OR T3vsT1: 1.21 (CI 95%: 0.90, 1.62), p trend = 0.21). These results were independent from disease severity (p-het: 0.70), time from diagnosis (p-het: 0.67) and CLL treatment received (p-het: 0.56). No interactions were detected. In conclusion, the consumption of a diet with high pro-inflammatory components was not significantly associated with CLL.

RNA viral infections are major causes of chronic lung disease exacerbations and can determine glucocorticoid resistance. The antibacterial peptide LL-37, the only member of human cathelicidin family, also functions as antiviral-activity enhancer. However, whether it can alleviate the glucocorticoid resistance caused by RNA viruses remains unclear. Here, we used type I (BEAS-2B) and type II (A549) lung epithelial cells to assess the effect of LL-37 on dsRNA-induced glucocorticoid resistance. We verified that LL-37 and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C, a mimic of viral dsRNA) interact and enter both cell lines. Co-treatment with LL-37 and poly I:C increased glucocorticoid-induced expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), an anti-inflammatory protein, compared to poly I:C alone. Pre-treatment with LL-37 also restored transactivation of the glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Moreover, LL-37 rescued poly I:C-induced glucocorticoid resistance by increasing phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptor. Importantly, LL-37 downregulated poly I:C-induced Erk and Akt signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells. Finally, we verified our data in vivo, showing that mCRAMP, the mouse LL-37 ortholog, can alleviate poly I:C-induced glucocorticoid insensitivity in a murine asthma model. In summary, this study showed that LL-37 restored glucocorticoid sensitivity impaired by dsRNA possibly by inhibiting Akt pathway, in addition to Erk1/2 pathway. These findings suggest LL-37 as a therapeutic agent for treatment of viral infections in inflammatory pulmonary diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although Sanger sequencing (SS) is considered the gold standard for BCR-ABL1 KD mutation screening, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently been assessed in retrospective studies. We conducted a prospective, multicenter study (NEXT-in-CML) to assess the frequency and clinical relevance of low-level mutations and the feasibility, cost, and turnaround times of NGS-based BCR-ABL1 mutation screening in a routine setting. A series of 236 consecutive CML patients with failure (n = 124) or warning (n = 112) response to TKI therapy were analyzed in parallel by SS and NGS in 1 of 4 reference laboratories. Fifty-one patients (22 failure, 29 warning) who were negative for mutations by SS had low-level mutations detectable by NGS. Moreover, 29 (27 failure, 2 warning) of 60 patients who were positive for mutations by SS showed additional low-level mutations. Thus, mutations undetectable by SS were identified in 80 out of 236 patients (34%), of whom 42 (18% of the total) had low-level mutations somehow relevant for clinical decision making. Prospective monitoring of mutation kinetics demonstrated that TKI-resistant low-level mutations are invariably selected if the patients are not switched to another TKI or if they are switched to a inappropriate TKI or TKI dose. The NEXT-in-CML study provides for the first time robust demonstration of the clinical relevance of low-level mutations, supporting the incorporation of NGS-based BCR-ABL1 KD mutation screening results in the clinical decision algorithms.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Soverini, Simona', 'Bavaro, Luana', 'De Benedittis, Caterina', 'Martelli, Margherita', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Orofino, Nicola', 'Sica, Simona', 'Sora, Federica', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Russo Rossi, Antonella Vita', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'di Raimondo, Francesco', ""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'di Bona, Eros', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Sancetta, Rosaria', 'Salvucci, Marzia', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Girasoli, Mariella', 'Coluzzi, Sabrina', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Calistri, Elisabetta', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Serra, Anna', 'Errichiello, Santa', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Mignone, Flavio', 'Laginestra, Maria Antonella', 'Pileri, Stefano Aldo', 'Percesepe, Antonio', 'Tenti, Elena', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Soverini S', 'Bavaro L', 'De Benedittis C', 'Martelli M', 'Iurlo A', 'Orofino N', 'Sica S', 'Sora F', 'Lunghi F', 'Ciceri F', 'Galimberti S', 'Barate C', 'Bonifacio M', 'Scaffidi L', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Albano F', 'Russo Rossi AV', 'Stagno F', 'di Raimondo F', ""D'Adda M"", 'di Bona E', 'Abruzzese E', 'Binotto G', 'Sancetta R', 'Salvucci M', 'Capodanno I', 'Girasoli M', 'Coluzzi S', 'Attolico I', 'Musolino C', 'Calistri E', 'Annunziata M', 'Bocchia M', 'Stella S', 'Serra A', 'Errichiello S', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Vigneri P', 'Mignone F', 'Laginestra MA', 'Pileri SA', 'Percesepe A', 'Tenti E', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M', 'Cavo M', 'Martinelli G']",,"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

In parallel, evidence from model organisms shows that paternal diet can affect offspring metabolic health in a process involving sperm tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA). Here, we report that human sperm are acutely sensitive to nutrient flux, both in terms of sperm motility and changes in sperm tsRNA. Over the course of a 2-week diet intervention, in which we first introduced a healthy diet followed by a diet rich in sugar, sperm motility increased and stabilized at high levels. Small RNA-seq on repeatedly sampled sperm from the same individuals revealed that tsRNAs were up-regulated by eating a high-sugar diet for just 1 week. Unsupervised clustering identified two independent pathways for the biogenesis of these tsRNAs: one involving a novel class of fragments with specific cleavage in the T-loop of mature nuclear tRNAs and the other exclusively involving mitochondrial tsRNAs. Mitochondrial involvement was further supported by a similar up-regulation of mitochondrial rRNA-derived small RNA (rsRNA). Notably, the changes in sugar-sensitive tsRNA were positively associated with simultaneous changes in sperm motility and negatively associated with obesity in an independent clinical cohort. This rapid response to a dietary intervention on tsRNA in human sperm is attuned with the paternal intergenerational metabolic responses found in model organisms. More importantly, our findings suggest shared diet-sensitive mechanisms between sperm motility and the biogenesis of tsRNA, which provide novel insights about the interplay between nutrition and male reproductive health.",,"['Natt, Daniel', 'Kugelberg, Unn', 'Casas, Eduard', 'Nedstrand, Elizabeth', 'Zalavary, Stefan', 'Henriksson, Pontus', 'Nijm, Carola', 'Jaderquist, Julia', 'Sandborg, Johanna', 'Flinke, Eva', 'Ramesh, Rashmi', 'Orkenby, Lovisa', 'Appelkvist, Filip', 'Lingg, Thomas', 'Guzzi, Nicola', 'Bellodi, Cristian', 'Lof, Marie', 'Vavouri, Tanya', 'Ost, Anita']","['Natt D', 'Kugelberg U', 'Casas E', 'Nedstrand E', 'Zalavary S', 'Henriksson P', 'Nijm C', 'Jaderquist J', 'Sandborg J', 'Flinke E', 'Ramesh R', 'Orkenby L', 'Appelkvist F', 'Lingg T', 'Guzzi N', 'Bellodi C', 'Lof M', 'Vavouri T', 'Ost A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9182-9401', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6001-1276', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5209-6655', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2482-7048', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0389-9333', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8047-5329', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2273-4430', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2352-9049', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0547-1904']","['Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC-IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Division of Community Medicine, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Division of Community Medicine, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Division of Community Medicine, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Lund University, Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University, Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Division of Community Medicine, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC-IGTP), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Linkoping University, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neurobiology, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191226,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Diet/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/metabolism', 'RNA/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer/drug effects/genetics', 'Sperm Motility/*drug effects/physiology', 'Spermatozoa/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology']",PMC6932762,,,,2019/12/27 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/12/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pbio.3000559 [doi]', 'PBIOLOGY-D-19-01390 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Biol. 2019 Dec 26;17(12):e3000559. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000559. eCollection 2019 Dec.,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,['Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2020 Apr;16(4):200-201.

However, those methods had never been compared in samples from the same tumor and patient. In this work, we compared the two most used methods, elution and centrifugation, in pieces of the same biopsy samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). First, we established that high G-force (10000g) was required to obtain TIF from cSCC by centrifugation. Second, we compared the centrifugation method with the elution method in pieces of three different cSCC tumors. We found that the mean protein intensities based in the number of peptide spectrum matches was significantly higher in the centrifuged samples than in the eluted samples. Regarding the robustness of the methods, we observed higher overlapping between both methods (77-80%) than among samples (50%). These results suggest that there exists an elevated consistence of TIF composition independently of the method used.

DESIGN, SETTING: Population-based study; analysis of Australian Childhood Cancer Registry data for the 20 547 children under 15 years of age diagnosed with cancer in Australia between 1983 and 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rate changes during 1983-2015 were assessed by joinpoint regression, with rates age-standardised to the 2001 Australian standard population. Incidence projections to 2035 were estimated by age-period-cohort modelling. RESULTS: The overall age-standardised incidence rate of childhood cancer increased by 34% between 1983 and 2015, increasing by 1.2% (95% CI, +0.5% to +1.9%) per annum between 2005 and 2015. During 2011-2015, the mean annual number of children diagnosed with cancer in Australia was 770, an incidence rate of 174 cases (95% CI, 169-180 cases) per million children per year. The incidence of hepatoblastoma (annual percentage change [APC], +2.3%; 95% CI, +0.8% to +3.8%), Burkitt lymphoma (APC, +1.6%; 95% CI, +0.4% to +2.8%), osteosarcoma (APC, +1.1%; 95%, +0.0% to +2.3%), intracranial and intraspinal embryonal tumours (APC, +0.9%; 95% CI, +0.4% to +1.5%), and lymphoid leukaemia (APC, +0.5%; 95% CI, +0.2% to +0.8%) increased significantly across the period 1983-2015. The incidence rate of childhood melanoma fell sharply between 1996 and 2015 (APC, -7.7%; 95% CI, -10% to -4.8%). The overall annual cancer incidence rate is conservatively projected to rise to about 186 cases (95% CI, 175-197 cases) per million children by 2035 (1060 cases per year). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of several childhood cancer types steadily increased during 1983-2015. Although the reasons for these rises are largely unknown, our findings provide a foundation for health service planning for meeting the needs of children who will be diagnosed with cancer until 2035.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Acalabrutinib is an oral, highly selective BTK inhibitor that allows for twice-daily dosing due to its selectivity. In this phase 1b/2 study, 134 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL (median age, 66 years [range, 42-85 years]; median prior therapies, 2 [range, 1-13]) received acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily for a median of 41 months (range, 0.2-58 months). Median trough BTK occupancy at steady state was 97%. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, and were most commonly diarrhea (52%) and headache (51%). Grade >/=3 AEs (occurring in >/=5% of patients) were neutropenia (14%), pneumonia (11%), hypertension (7%), anemia (7%), and diarrhea (5%). Atrial fibrillation and major bleeding AEs (all grades) occurred in 7% and 5% of patients, respectively. Most patients (56%) remain on treatment; the primary reasons for discontinuation were progressive disease (21%) and AEs (11%). The overall response rate, including partial response with lymphocytosis, with acalabrutinib was 94%; responses were similar regardless of genomic features (presence of del(11)(q22.3), del(17)(p13.1), complex karyotype, or immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain mutation status). Median duration of response and progression-free survival (PFS) have not been reached; the estimated 45-month PFS was 62% (95% confidence interval, 51% to 71%). BTK mutation was detected in 6 of 9 patients (67%) at relapse. This updated and expanded study confirms the efficacy, durability of response, and long-term safety of acalabrutinib, justifying its further investigation in previously untreated and treated patients with CLL/SLL.

METHODS: A total of 28 patients with transformation of CLL into DLBCL who had undergone FDG PET before treatment were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analysis of conventional clinicopathologic variables (sex, age, World Health Organization performance status score, International Prognostic Index score, Binet stage, lactate dehydrogenase serum level [LDH], platelet count, presence or not of prior therapies for CLL, the time from CLL to Richter syndrome, Ann Arbor stage, Bulky or not) and metabolic parameters (SUVmax, SUVmean, TMTV, and total lesion glycolysis) at the time of the transformation of CLL into DLBCL were tested for overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, 14 patients (50%) died during the follow-up period. Low platelet count, World Health Organization performance status score >1, high LDH, and high TMTV were found to be significant prognostic factors for OS on univariate analysis. The 5-year estimates of OS were 63% in the low metabolic burden group (TMTV </=1200 cm) and 0% in the high metabolic burden group (TMTV >1200 cm). Multivariate analysis revealed that only high LDH was a significant predictor after adjustment for other variables of OS.

Also, her complete blood cell counts showed pancytopenia and blood smear revealed a few immature cells (3%). DIAGNOSES: A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated acute myelomonocytic leukemia, and the chromosomal analysis revealed a 46, XX, del18 (p11) [20] karyotype and cytogenetics and molecular markers showed all negative results. INTERVENTIONS: Since this diagnosis, she received remission-inducing chemotherapy comprising anthracycline and cytarabine, which is a standard regimen for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and followed by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. OUTCOMES: After transplantation, the bone marrow engrafted successfully without complications. She visited our clinic regularly with no evidence of leukemia relapse or graft-versus host disease.

RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, computational analysis methods have been applied to clinical flow cytometry data of hematological malignancies with promising results. Most studies combined dimension reduction (principle component analysis) or clustering methods (FlowSOM, generalized mixture models) with machine learning classifiers (support vector machines, random forest). For diagnosis and classification of hematological malignancies, many studies have reported results concordant with manual expert analysis, including B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia detection and acute leukemia classification. Other studies, e.g. concerning diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes and classification of lymphoma, have shown to be able to increase diagnostic accuracy. With respect to treatment response monitoring, studies have focused on, for example, computational minimal residual disease detection in multiple myeloma and posttreatment classification of healthy or diseased in acute myeloid leukemia. The results of these studies are encouraging, although accurate relapse prediction remains challenging. To facilitate clinical implementation, collaboration and (prospective) validation in multicenter setting are necessary.

Clinical and molecular characterizations reveal a distinctive disease. Thirty percent of patients have mutations of hereditary cancer syndromes, especially Lynch syndrome. A recent analysis, testing germline DNA for mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes, showed that some patients younger than 50 years had mutations of high-penetrance colorectal cancer genes such as APC (adenopolyposis coli). Others had mutations in high-penetrance or moderate-penetrance genes not traditionally associated with colorectal cancer, such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), whereas still others had low penetrance colorectal cancer genes. In the current study, we examined the incidence of second cancers following early onset (age less than 50 y) colorectal cancer. METHODS: The initial study population was assembled using records from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. The SEER*Stat MP-SIR (multiple primary-standardized incidence ratio) tool was used to calculate SIRs and excess risk for second primary malignancies. The SIR is expressed as the ratio of observed-to-expected (O/E) cases. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and AACR Project Genie for genetic analysis. The data were accessed with the online Xena Browser and cBioportal. RESULTS: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) O/E ratios were significantly >1 in patients aged less than 50 years, at 12 to 59 months after colorectal cancer. In patients aged 50 years and older, O/E ratios were equal to 1 or quite close at 12 to 59 months after colorectal cancer. Alterations in 3 AML genes, CEBPA-AS1, MLLT1, and MLLT6, affected the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients less than 50 years but not older than 50 years. One AML gene, FLT3, had the highest copy number alteration frequency of any gene in 1438 colorectal patients 18 to 48 years of age. Genetic alterations of FLT3/TP53 were mutually exclusive. Genetic alterations of FLT3/JAK2 and JAK2/CTNNB1 were co-occurrent. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that early onset colorectal cancer and AML may be related diseases.",,"['Lehrer, Steven', 'Rheinstein, Peter H']","['Lehrer S', 'Rheinstein PH']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Severn Health Solutions, Severna Park, MD.']",['eng'],['R01 CA049506/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Young Adult']",PMC7103506,['NIHMS1066527'],,,2019/12/27 06:00,2020/08/07 06:00,['2019/12/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/COC.0000000000000658 [doi]', '00000421-202004000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2020 Apr;43(4):263-269. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000658.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation for treatment of this disease remains unclear in terms of transplantation-related toxicity. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) are both harmful to patients after allogeneic transplantation, but may have some positive effects through a substitute graft-versus-lymphoma effect. METHODS: To investigate the effect of GVHD on the survival of patients with refractory LBL, we retrospectively studied the outcomes of 213 patients with LBL who underwent first allogeneic stem cell transplantation before the age of 18 years, between 1990 and 2015 in Japan. RESULTS: The five-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival rates after stem cell transplantation were 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.2-56.9) and 47.8% (95% CI, 40.8-54.4), respectively. In univariate landmark analyses, the probability of OS was significantly better in patients with aGVHD than in those without (P = 0.002, five-year OS 58.1% vs 39.0%). The probability of OS was also better in patients with cGVHD than in those without (P = 0.036, five-year OS 72.2% vs 54.7%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only aGVHD was associated with better OS (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.94, P = 0.024). Progression and recurrence statuses at SCT were associated with poor prognosis. The patients with grade II aGVHD showed the best prognosis (five-year OS: 65.6%). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the occurrence of aGVHD may be associated with better outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory LBL who undergo allogeneic transplantation.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mitsui, Tetsuo', 'Fujita, Naoto', 'Koga, Yuhki', 'Fukano, Reiji', 'Osumi, Tomoo', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Kakuda, Harumi', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Yabe, Hiromasa', 'Takita, Junko', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji']","['Mitsui T', 'Fujita N', 'Koga Y', 'Fukano R', 'Osumi T', 'Hama A', 'Koh K', 'Kakuda H', 'Inoue M', 'Fukuda T', 'Yabe H', 'Takita J', 'Shimada A', 'Hashii Y', 'Sato A', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kanda Y', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kobayashi R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3356-4921', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1879-880X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0056-9988', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4087-3426', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5536-6788', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5207-3779', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3937-0856']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamagata University Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine for Hospital Collaboration, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Chiba Children's Hospital, Chiba, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Sendai, Japan."", 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Innovative Cancer Center/Oncology-Hematology, Shimane University Hospital Cancer Center, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191226,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*children and young adults', '*lymphoblastic lymphoma', '*refractory', '*stem cell transplantation']",2019/12/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:00,['2019/12/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28129 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Apr;67(4):e28129. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28129.

Nevertheless, -7/7q- occurs frequently with other high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities such as complex karyotype (CK), monosomal karyotype (MK), monosomy 5 or deletion 5q (-5/5q-), 17p abnormalities (abn(17p)) or inversion of chromosome 3 (inv(3)), the presence of which may influence the outcomes after SCT. A total of 1109 patients were allocated to this study. Two-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 30% and 36%, respectively. Two-year probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 20%. We defined five different cytogenetic subgroups: the ""-7/7q- +/- CK group- designated group1,"" the ""MK group-designated group 2,"" the ""-5/5q- group- designated group 3,"" the ""abn(17p) group- designated group 4"" and the ""inv(3) group- designated group 5."" The 2-year probability of LFS in first remission was 48% for group 1, 36.4% for group 2, 28.4% for group 3, 19.1% for group 4 and 17.3% for group 5, respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed those significant differences across groups. Note, SCT in -7/7q- AML provides durable responses in one third of the patients. The presence of -7/7q- with or without CK in the absence of MK, abn(17p) or inv(3) is associated with a better survival after SCT. On the contrary, addition of MK, -5/5q-, abn(17p) or inv(3) identifies a sub-group of patients with poor prognosis even after SCT.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Poire, Xavier', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Poire X', 'Labopin M', 'Polge E', 'Volin L', 'Finke J', 'Ganser A', 'Blaise D', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Beelen D', 'Forcade E', 'Lioure B', 'Socie G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Maertens J', 'Cornelissen J', 'Craddock C', 'Mohty M', 'Esteve J', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1897-0227'],"['Section of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology-Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institut Paoli Calmette, Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Marseille, France.', 'CHU de Lille, LIRIC INSERM U995, Universite Lille2, Lille, France.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Nouvel Hopital Civil, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Hemostasiology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France."", 'University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200117,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['Chromosome 7, monosomy']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,2019/12/27 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/12/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25714 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Mar;95(3):282-294. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25714.

PROCEDURE: Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted using clofarabine at 3.5 to 15 mg/kg in mice. PDXs were established from relapsed/refractory ALL patients who exhibited good or poor responses to clofarabine. PDX engraftment and response to clofarabine (either as a single agent or in combinations) were assessed based on stringent objective response measures modeled after the clinical setting. RESULTS: In naive immune-deficient NSG mice, we determined that a clofarabine dose of 3.5 mg/kg resulted in systemic exposures equivalent to those achieved in pediatric ALL patients treated with clofarabine-based regimens. This dose was markedly lower than the doses of clofarabine used in previously reported preclinical studies (typically 30-60 mg/kg) and, when scheduled consistent with the clinical regimen (daily x 5), resulted in 34-fold lower clofarabine exposures. Using a well-tolerated clofarabine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide combination regimen, we then found that the responses of PDXs better reflected the clinical responses of the patients from whom the PDXs were derived. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified an in vivo clofarabine treatment regimen that reflects the clinical responses of relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL patients. This regimen could be used prospectively to identify patients who might benefit from clofarabine-based treatment. Our findings are an important step toward individualizing prospective patient selection for the use of clofarabine in relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL patients and highlight the need for detailed PK evaluation in murine PDX models.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Xie, Jinhan', 'Span, Miriam', 'van Maarseveen, Erik', 'Langenhorst, Jurgen', 'Boddy, Alan V', 'Sia, Keith C S', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Venn, Nicola', 'Punt, Arjen M', 'Tyrrell, Vanessa', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Trahair, Toby', 'Lau, Loretta', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Xie J', 'Span M', 'van Maarseveen E', 'Langenhorst J', 'Boddy AV', 'Sia KCS', 'Sutton R', 'Venn N', 'Punt AM', 'Tyrrell V', 'Haber M', 'Trahair T', 'Lau L', 'Marshall GM', 'Lock RB']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3295-228X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3436-9071']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'Clinical Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'UniSA Cancer Research Institute, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'Clinical Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191225,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Clofarabine/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*clofarabine', '*combination chemotherapy', '*xenograft']",2019/12/27 06:00,2020/06/27 06:00,['2019/12/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28133 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Apr;67(4):e28133. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28133.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) and mature plasmacytoid dendritic cell proliferation (MPDCP) are two types of malignancies originating from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Some evidence has indicated the existence of other pDC neoplasms. In addition, cases of myeloid neoplasms (MNs), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with increased pDCs (AML/MDS-pDCs) seem to have immature DCs according to the vaguely consistent expression of markers among MNs and pDCs, which appear to fit the developmental pattern of normal DCs. We analyzed 14 AML/MDS-pDC cases mainly for their immunophenotype by flow cytometry and inferred their CD expression pattern. The patients' clinical information and other laboratory data were collected and reviewed. AML/MDS-pDCs show a different pattern of markers from BPDCN and MPDCP. Three maturation-involved stages were found in these AML/MDS-pDCs patients. Stage I was the most immature stage and displayed an expression profile of CD34(+/st+) CD117(+/st+) BDCA2(-) BDCA4(-) CD123(+) HLA-DR(+/st+) CD4(-) CD45dim(+) ; Stage II was the more immature stage displayed a phenotype of CD34(dim+) CD117(dim+) BDCA2(-/dim+) BDCA4(-/dim+) CD123(st+) HLA-DR(+/st+) CD4(-) CD45(+) ; and Stage III was the mature stage showed CD34(-) CD117(-) BDCA2(+) /BDCA4(+) CD123(st+) HLA-DR(+/st+) CD4(+) CD45(+/st+) . Three maturation-involved stages overlapped well with the phenotypes of normal DC progenitors in a continuously developmental process: granulocyte, monocyte, and DC progenitors (GMDPs) and/or monocyte and DC progenitors (MDPs), common DC progenitors (CDPs), pDCs, and/or pre-DCs. In this study, we considered AML/MDS-pDCs as entities that were distinct from BPDCN and MPDCP and correlated the components of this tumor with the normal DC differentiation pathway, which provides new evidence for understanding DC neoplasms.

METHODS: The primary analysis comprised adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative patients in first complete haematologic remission (MRD >/= 10(-3) ). Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between blinatumomab- and SOC-treatment groups. Baseline differences between groups were adjusted by propensity scores. RESULTS: The primary analysis included 73 and 182 patients from the blinatumomab and historic data sets, respectively. When weighted by age to the blinatumomab-treatment group, median RFS was 7.8 months and median OS was 25.9 months in the SOC-treated group. In the blinatumomab study, median RFS was 35.2 months; median OS was not evaluable. Propensity score weighting achieved balance with seven baseline prognostic factors. With adjustment for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) status, a 50% reduction in risk of relapse or death was observed with blinatumomab vs SOC. Median RFS, unadjusted for HSCT status, was 35.2 months with blinatumomab and 8.3 months with SOC. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses suggest that blinatumomab improves RFS, and possibly OS, in adults with MRD-positive Ph-negative BCP-ALL vs SOC.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Adopting next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for identification of gene fusion in patients with acute leukemia can be a good alternative to conventional tests. In the present study, the NGS RNA fusion gene panel test was applied to diagnostic samples of patients with acute leukemia to identify fusion genes more efficiently. Among 134 patients with acute leukemia, 53 gene fusions were detected in 52 patients. In addition to the recurrent gene fusions specified in the WHO diagnostic criteria, 11 rare or novel gene fusions were identified. Of those, two were gene fusions associated with Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), two were novel gene fusions, three were gene fusions with novel partner genes, and six were rare gene fusions from previous reports. We confirmed the clinical utility of the NGS test in identifying clinically significant gene fusions such as gene fusions involving KMT2A that has a large number of partners. Notably, Ph-like ALL-associated gene fusions could be easily identified despite the wide variety of genes involved. The results from the present study may contribute toward a better understanding of the genomic landscape of acute leukemia as well as patient management.","['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Kim, Borahm', 'Kim, Esl', 'Lee, Seung-Tae', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Lyu, Chuhl Joo', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Choi, Jong Rak']","['Kim B', 'Kim E', 'Lee ST', 'Cheong JW', 'Lyu CJ', 'Min YH', 'Choi JR']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1047-1415'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['2016R1D1A1B01010566/National Research Foundation of Korea', '2018R1C1B6005185/National Research Foundation of Korea']",['Journal Article'],20200108,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Fusion', 'Genomics/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA gene fusion detection', 'acute leukemia', 'next-generation sequencing']",2019/12/27 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/12/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2709 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;38(1):82-88. doi: 10.1002/hon.2709.

We evaluate the clinical value of NGS in the screening, diagnosis, and follow-up in hematologic neoplasms. METHODS: A targeted NGS panel was used to assess a total of 178 patients for questionable or previously diagnosed myeloid neoplasms. RESULTS: Gene variants were identified in 53% of patients. Novel variants were identified in 29% of patients and variants of unknown significance in 34%. Bone marrow samples yielded a higher number of variants than in peripheral blood. NGS is a more sensitive test than conventional cytogenetics. In several cases, NGS played a key role in the screening, diagnostics, prognostic stratification, and the clinical follow-up of a wide variety of myeloid neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: NGS is an effective tool in the evaluation of suspected and confirmed hematologic neoplasms and could become part of the routine workup of patients.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

This advance has emanated from elucidation of pathways responsible for tumorigenesis followed by targeting of these pathways by specific molecules. Cardiovascular care has become an increasingly critical aspect of patient care in part because patients live longer, but also due to potential associated toxicities from these therapies. Because of the targeted nature of cancer therapies, cardiac and vascular side effects may additionally provide insights into the basic biology of vascular disease. We herein provide the example of tyrosine kinase inhibitors utilized in chronic myelogenous leukemia to illustrate this medical transformation. We describe the vascular considerations for the clinical care of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients as well as the emerging literature on mechanisms of toxicities of the individual tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Eligible for this study were patients allografted between January 2008 and December 2018 in 10 transplant centers, with AML in first or second remission: 201 patients received BUFLU, whereas 253 received TBF. The 2 groups (BUFLU and TBF) were comparable for age (P = .13) and adverse AML risk factors (P = .3). The TBF group had more second remissions and more haploidentical grafts. The donor type included HLA-identical siblings, unrelated donors, and family haploidentical donors. The 5-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 19% for BUFLU and 22% for TBF (P = .8), and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 30% and 15%, respectively (P = .0004). The 5-year actuarial survival was 51% for BUFLU and 68% for TBF (P = .002). In a multivariate Cox analysis, after correcting for confounding factors, the use of TBF reduced the risk of relapse compared with BUFLU (P = .03) and the risk of death (P = .03). In a matched pair analysis of 108 BUFLU patients matched with 108 TBF patients, with the exclusion of haploidentical grafts, TBF reduced the risk of relapse (P = .006) and there was a trend for improved survival (P = .07). Superior survival of patients receiving TBF as compared with BUFLU is due to a reduced risk of relapse, with comparable NRM. The survival advantage is independent of donor type and AML risk factors.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, results of randomized studies do not necessarily reflect the outcomes of a real-life population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 283 unselected APL patients treated in 20 Polish hospitals between 2005 and 2017. All patients were intended to be treated with PETHEMA (Programa Espanol para el Tratamiento de las Hemopatias Malignas) protocols based on all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy. RESULTS: The probability of overall survival at 4 years was 67%, while event-free survival was 64%. The early death (ED) rate was 20.1% (n = 57), while 3.5% (n = 10) patients died before induction therapy was started. The main causes of ED included hemorrhage (45.6%), infections (17.5%), and differentiation syndrome (14.5%). Of 273 treated patients, 214 (78.4%) experienced hematologic morphologic remission, 2 (0.7%) were found to have resistant disease, 47 (17.2%) could not be evaluated for response because of ED, and in 6 (3.7%) no data concerning the response were available. Multivariate analyses showed that predictors of ED and overall survival were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status > 2, age > 60 years, and all types of bleeding episodes that occurred before starting therapy, while an additional predictor of event-free survival was high white blood cell count (> 10 10(9)/L). CONCLUSION: ED remains a major problem in APL patients, especially in a real-life population. Shortening of the time between the initial contact with a health care professional, and all-trans retinoic acid administration and the use of appropriate supportive care could improve the outcome of unselected APL population, mainly by reducing the ED rate.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, serum albumin medium supplements represent a major source of biological contamination in cell cultures and often cause loss of cellular function. As serum albumin exhibits significant batch-to-batch variability, it has also been blamed for causing major issues in experimental reproducibility. We recently discovered the synthetic polymer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an inexpensive, Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible, and biologically inert serum albumin replacement for ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell cultures. Importantly, PVA is free of the biological contaminants that have plagued serum albumin-based media. Here, we describe that PVA can replace serum albumin in a range of blood and immune cell cultures including cell lines, primary leukemia samples, and human T lymphocytes. PVA can even replace human serum in the generation and expansion of functional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, offering a potentially safer and more cost-efficient approach for this clinical cell therapy. In summary, PVA represents a chemically defined, biologically inert, and inexpensive alternative to serum albumin for a range of cell cultures in hematology and immunology.","['Copyright (c) 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

However, the misclassification costs are usually determined empirically based on user expertise, which leads to unstable performance of cost-sensitive classification. Therefore, an efficient and accurate method is needed to calculate the optimal cost weights. RESULTS: In this paper, two approaches are proposed to search for the optimal cost weights, targeting at the highest weighted classification accuracy (WCA). One is the optimal cost weights grid searching and the other is the function fitting. Comparisons are made between these between the two algorithms above. In experiments, we classify imbalanced gene expression data using extreme learning machine to test the cost weights obtained by the two approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive experimental results show that the function fitting method is generally more efficient, which can well find the optimal cost weights with acceptable WCA.",,"['Lu, Huijuan', 'Xu, Yige', 'Ye, Minchao', 'Yan, Ke', 'Gao, Zhigang', 'Jin, Qun']","['Lu H', 'Xu Y', 'Ye M', 'Yan K', 'Gao Z', 'Jin Q']",,"['Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Wave Information Technology and Metrology of Zhejiang Province, College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Wave Information Technology and Metrology of Zhejiang Province, College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Wave Information Technology and Metrology of Zhejiang Province, College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China. yeminchao@cjlu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Wave Information Technology and Metrology of Zhejiang Province, College of Information Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'College of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University, Tokorozawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191224,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6929277,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cost-sensitive', 'Misclassification cost', 'Parameter fitting', 'Weighted classification accuracy']",2019/12/26 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/12/26 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-019-3255-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-019-3255-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2019 Dec 24;20(Suppl 25):681. doi: 10.1186/s12859-019-3255-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, this population has remained the primary target for novel microbiota therapeutics. Because the types of insults to the microbiome are similar during hematopoietic cell transplantation and intensive antileukemia therapy, this study evaluated whether the dysbiosis states are similar in the 2 settings. METHODS: This study compared gut microbiota assemblages and community domination states in 2 cohorts of patients: patients with intensively treated acute leukemia (AL) and allo-HCT recipients. 16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling of thrice weekly stool samples was performed. Linear discriminant analysis effect size was used to determine differentially abundant taxa in groups of interest, and mixed modes were used to determine the predictors of microbiome states. RESULTS: Microbiome changes in both cohorts were characterized by a marked loss of diversity and domination of low-diversity communities by Enterococcus. In the AL cohort, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was also inversely correlated with diversity. Communities dominated by these genera were compositionally different. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities in microbiota assemblages between the 2 cohorts support a broader scope for microbiota-directed therapeutics than previously considered, whereas specific differences suggest a personalized aspect to such therapeutics with the possibility of a differential response.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Rashidi, Armin', 'Kaiser, Thomas', 'Graiziger, Carolyn', 'Holtan, Shernan G', 'Rehman, Tauseef Ur', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Dunny, Gary M', 'Khoruts, Alexander', 'Staley, Christopher']","['Rashidi A', 'Kaiser T', 'Graiziger C', 'Holtan SG', 'Rehman TU', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Dunny GM', 'Khoruts A', 'Staley C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9384-272X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2225-8171', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2309-0083']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191224,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Dysbiosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*dysbiosis', '*leukemia', '*microbiota', '*transplantation']",2019/12/25 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32641 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Apr 1;126(7):1434-1447. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32641.

This may be attributable to graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects by donor lymphocytes, but their regulating mechanisms are unclear. Antitumor natural killer (NK) cell immunity is assumed to be important in CML, and we have previously shown that allelic polymorphisms of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are associated with the response of CML to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we report a case of CML in blastic phase who received HLA-matched but KIR3DL1 allelic-mismatched allo-HSCT. After transplant, decreased BCR-ABL transcript levels and enhanced NK cell activity were transiently observed. However, reconstitution of KIR3DL1-expressing NK cells occurred, which was associated with diminished NK cell activity and increased BCR-ABL. This case indicates the potential significance of KIR3DL1 in NK cell-mediated GVL activity following allo-HSCT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to analyze the association between sequential KIR3DL1 expression and activity of NK cells after allo-HSCT. Selecting donors with KIR3DL1-null alleles may maintain competent GVL effects and provide improved outcomes in allo-HSCT for CML.",,"['Ureshino, Hiroshi', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Sano, Haruhiko', 'Kubota, Yasushi', 'Ando, Toshihiko', 'Kidoguchi, Keisuke', 'Kusaba, Kana', 'Itamura, Hidekazu', 'Kojima, Hiroto', 'Kusunoki, Yasushi', 'Miyazaki, Yuki', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Tanaka, Hidenori', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Oshima, Koichi', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Ureshino H', 'Shindo T', 'Sano H', 'Kubota Y', 'Ando T', 'Kidoguchi K', 'Kusaba K', 'Itamura H', 'Kojima H', 'Kusunoki Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Kojima K', 'Tanaka H', 'Saji H', 'Oshima K', 'Kimura S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2085-6151'],"['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan. takeros@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogo-in, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. takeros@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191223,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (KIR3DL1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)']",IM,"['Allografts', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/immunology', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'KIR3DL1', 'Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor', 'Natural killer cell (NK cell)']",2019/12/25 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02809-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02809-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 May;111(5):733-738. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02809-5.

METHODS: Flow cytometric measurements of fluorescent pulse width and height were used to track the endocytic uptake into Daudi cells of a fluorescently labelled saporin toxin and the saporin based immunotoxin, OKT10-SAP. Subsequently, measurement of changes in pulse width were used to investigate the effect of a triterpenoid saponin on the endolysosomal escape of internalised toxin into the cytosol. Live cell confocal microscopy was used to validate the flow cytometry data. RESULTS: Increased endolysosomal escape of saporin and OKT10-SAP was observed by confocal microscopy in cells treated with saponin. Fluorescent pulse width measurements were also able to detect and quantify escape more sensitively than confocal microscopy. Saponin induced endolysosomal escape could be abrogated by treatment with chloroquine, an inhibitor of endolysosomal acidification. Chloroquine abrogation of escape was also mirrored by a concomitant abrogation of cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Poor endolysosomal escape is often a rate limiting step for the cytosolic delivery of protein toxins and other macromolecules. Pulse width analysis offers a simple method to semi-quantify the endolysosomal escape of this and similar molecules into the cytosol.",,"['Wensley, Harrison J', 'Johnston, David A', 'Smith, Wendy S', 'Holmes, Suzanne E', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U', 'Flavell, David J']","['Wensley HJ', 'Johnston DA', 'Smith WS', 'Holmes SE', 'Flavell SU', 'Flavell DJ']",,"['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Biomedical Imaging Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK. davidf@leukaemiabusters.org.uk.', 'University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK. davidf@leukaemiabusters.org.uk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191223,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Immunotoxins/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Saponins/chemistry', 'Saporins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toxins, Biological/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/chemistry']",PMC6928089,,['NOTNLM'],"['Endosomal escape', 'Flow cytometry', 'Immunotoxin', 'Saponin', 'Saporin']",2019/12/25 06:00,2020/02/28 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11095-019-2725-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11095-019-2725-1 [pii]']",epublish,Pharm Res. 2019 Dec 23;37(1):16. doi: 10.1007/s11095-019-2725-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, discovering somatic SVs in single cells has been challenging, with copy-number-neutral and complex variants typically escaping detection. Here we describe single-cell tri-channel processing (scTRIP), a computational framework that integrates read depth, template strand and haplotype phase to comprehensively discover SVs in individual cells. We surveyed SV landscapes of 565 single cells, including transformed epithelial cells and patient-derived leukemic samples, to discover abundant SV classes, including inversions, translocations and complex DNA rearrangements. Analysis of the leukemic samples revealed four times more somatic SVs than cytogenetic karyotyping, submicroscopic copy-number alterations, oncogenic copy-neutral rearrangements and a subclonal chromothripsis event. Advancing current methods, single-cell tri-channel processing can directly measure SV mutational processes in individual cells, such as breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, facilitating studies of clonal evolution, genetic mosaicism and SV formation mechanisms, which could improve disease classification for precision medicine.",,"['Sanders, Ashley D', 'Meiers, Sascha', 'Ghareghani, Maryam', 'Porubsky,

Chemotherapy is standard upfront treatment in most patients, but responses are short-lived with few FDA-approved ""novel"" agents available. We sought to define the impact of these novel agents as single agents or in clinical trials on the outcomes of patients with PTCL. From January 1994 to May 2019, adult patients with PTCL who were managed at our institution were included in this analysis. In addition to patients with incomplete data, those diagnosed with large granular lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) except for transformed mycosis fungoides were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. There were 219 patients included in the analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 18-90 years). First line therapies mostly consisted of combination chemotherapy (75%). There was a statistical difference among patients who received chemotherapy, novel agents alone and in chemotherapy-free combinations, other, and no treatment (P < .0001). In patients who were treated with second line chemotherapy, novel agents alone and in combination without chemotherapy, or other, there was a still a survival benefit favoring novel agents (P = .0417). In the third line, there was no statistical difference among the three groups (P = .569). All patients who received novel therapies and underwent autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) achieved a complete response (CR) and had a better survival compared with patients who underwent chemotherapy who had a 70% CR rate prior to autoSCT (P = .046). Exposure to FDA-approved novel agents, immunoepigenetic trials, and clinical trials in general was associated with an overall survival (OS) benefit (P = .003, P = .04, and P = .006, respectively). These data suggest that patients who receive novel agents have superior outcomes compared with patients without exposure to novel therapies who receive chemotherapy-predicated treatments.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Ma, Helen', 'Cheng, Bin', 'Falchi, Lorenzo', 'Marchi, Enrica', 'Sawas, Ahmed', 'Bhagat, Govind', ""O'Connor, Owen A""]","['Ma H', 'Cheng B', 'Falchi L', 'Marchi E', 'Sawas A', 'Bhagat G', ""O'Connor OA""]",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0416-5115'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Research Professorship (OAO)/American Cancer Society', 'Columbia Lymphoma Research Fund']",['Journal Article'],20191229,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['belinostat', 'clinical trial', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'outcomes', 'peripheral T-cell lymphoma', 'pralatrexate', 'romidepsin']",2019/12/25 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2705 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;38(1):51-58. doi: 10.1002/hon.2705.

The aim of this study was to give an overview of the frequency, clinical features, and risk factors associated with ED and TRM in first complete remission (CR1) during the last three consecutive treatment protocols of the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) between 1998 and 2014. METHODS: Incidence and risk factors associated with ED and TRM in CR1 were retrospectively studied in 245 patients treated according to the Dutch ANLL-97/AML-12 (n = 118), AML-15 (n = 60), or DB AML-01 (n = 67) protocols. RESULTS: The incidence of ED was, respectively, 5.1%, 6.7%, and 3.0% excluding deaths before treatment (P = NS), and 7.4%, 11.1%, and 4.4% including deaths before the onset of treatment. Severe underweight at initial diagnosis was significantly associated with more frequent ED. When relapse was included as a competing risk, cumulative incidence of death in CR1 were 5.9%, 5.0%, and 4.6% for ANLL97, AML15, and DB01, respectively (P = NS). The most important cause of TRM included infectious and SCT-related complications. CONCLUSION: We report relatively stable rates of ED and TRM in CR1 in the latest completed DCOG protocols for newly diagnosed AML patients. The most important causes of TRM were SCT- or infection-related, warranting further evaluation and awareness.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

They constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. Ocular manifestations are more frequent but less revealing of the disease, most often as a result of tumor invasion from the central nervous system .Other manifestations are secondary to bone marrow failure. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 17-year-old patient without any medical history hospitalized for pulmonary infection presenting a brutal and bilateral reduced vision. The examination of eye fundus finds white-centered retinal hemorrhages The etiological assessment confirms the diagnosis of acute leukemia. A treatment based on chemotherapy allowed a complete remission. DISCUSSION: white-centered retinal hemorrhage is rarely revealing acute leukemias It may be related to a medullary insufficiency or leukemic infiltrates constituting a sign of bad prognosis. CONCLUSION: A complete ophthalmological examination and a serious and wide etiological investigation are needed to help the discovery of whitecentred retinal hemorrhage.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), which regulates transcriptional elongation, has attracted extensive attention as a drug target. Although several inhibitors, such as alvocidib and dinaciclib, have shown potent therapeutic effects in clinical trials on AML, the lack of high selectivity for CDK9 and other CDKs has limited their optimal clinical efficacy. Therefore, developing highly selective CDK9 inhibitors is still imperative for the efficacy and safety profile in treating AML. Here, we report a novel highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, JSH-009, which exhibited high potency against CDK9 and displayed great selectivity over 468 kinases/mutants. It also demonstrates impressive in vitro and in vivo antileukemic efficacy in preclinical models of AML, which makes JSH-009 a useful pharmacological tool for elucidating CDK9-mediated transcription

First, granulocytic differentiation was described in FLT3-positive AML treated with FLT3 inhibitors, and more recently, monocytic differentiation was reported. METHODS: Two patients with myelomonocytic cells in their bone marrow were identified during routine follow-up after AML treatment that included FLT3 inhibitors. The bone marrow study was done as standard of care. RESULTS: Both patients had FLT3-ITD+ AML and showed an atypical maturing monocytic cell population and a decrease in the leukemic blast cell population after FLT3 inhibitor therapy. Concurrent genetic testing revealed persistent genetic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate monocytic maturation in FLT3+ AML after FLT3 inhibitor treatment. It is critical for pathologists and clinicians to be aware of the differentiation phenomenon, as these patients have persistent molecular abnormalities despite response to treatment and normalization of blast counts.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2019.

In this study, we evaluated the reversing effect of matrine, the principal alkaloid derived from Sophora alopecuroides, on chemoresistant leukemia K562/ADR cells. Matrine in a range of the nontoxic concentration was employed in the whole study. IC50s of cancer medicines were tested using WST-8 assay. Drug export and apoptotic rates were examined using flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expressions were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Our data indicated that matrine had potent reversal properties augmenting cytotoxicity of cancer medicines on K562/ADR cells as well as apoptotic rates induced by doxorubicin. Moreover, matrine inhibited drug-exporting activity and expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) on both mRNA and protein levels. That might result from inhibited NF-kappa B activation, which also led to restored intrinsic apoptosis. These findings suggest that matrine in the nontoxic concentration can suppress ABCB1 drug transport and facilitate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through the inhibiting effect on NF-kappa B and has the potential to become an efficient sensitizer for anticancer drug resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Zhi Chen et al.'],"['Chen, Zhi', 'Nishimura, Nobuhiro', 'Okamoto, Takayuki', 'Wada, Koichiro', 'Naora, Kohji']","['Chen Z', 'Nishimura N', 'Okamoto T', 'Wada K', 'Naora K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7624-3143', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2255-9748', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9231-0556', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6624-0291']","['Department of Pharmacy, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, International University of Health and Welfare, Okawa, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191122,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinolizines/*pharmacology', 'Sophora/*chemistry']",PMC6906886,,,,2019/12/25 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1269532 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Nov 22;2019:1269532. doi: 10.1155/2019/1269532. eCollection 2019.,['The authors have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study these conditions, we established and characterized a novel mouse model of ATL bone metastasis. Patient-derived ATL cell lines including three that do not express HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax (ATL-ED, RV-ATL, TL-Om1), an in vitro transformed human T-cell line with high Tax expression (HT-1RV), and an HTLV-1 negative T-cell lymphoma (Jurkat) were injected intratibially into NSG mice, and were capable of proliferating and modifying the bone microenvironment. Radiography, muCT, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, plasma calcium concentrations, and qRT-PCR for several tumor-bone signaling mRNAs were performed. Luciferase-positive ATL-ED bone tumors allowed for in vivo imaging and visualization of bone tumor growth and metastasis over time.

A total of 113 ALL patients who have received standardized chemotherapy cycle were analyzed. Cases that were not remission after induction chemotherapy or have received stem cell transplantation were excluded. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the levels of hematogones and CD34+ myeloblasts in bone marrow aspirations, and the patients were grouped according to the levels of these two precursor cell types. The long-term relapse-free survival(RFS) and recovery of peripheral blood cells of each group after induction chemotherapy were compared. The results indicated that, after induction chemotherapy, patients with hematogones >/=0.1% have a significantly longer remission period than patients with hematogones <0.1% (p = 0.001). Meanwhile, the level of hematogones was positively associated with the recovery of both hemoglobin and platelet in peripheral blood, while CD34+ myeloblasts level is irrelevant to the recovery of Hb and PLT in peripheral blood, level of hematogones and long-term prognosis.

Standard methods of evaluating selectivity of most reversibly bound drugs account for binding affinity but not the two-step process, affinity and inactivation, occurring during covalent inhibition. To illustrate this concept, we assessed the selectivity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) over TEC kinases by two novel therapeutics: ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. The two-step process and time-dependent inhibition unique to covalent inhibitors were evaluated with two biochemical assays measuring enzymatic function and inhibition kinetics. The selectivity for BTK over TEC found in these biochemical analyses was 1-1.5 for ibrutinib and 3.0-4.2 for acalabrutinib. To further assess drug selectivity in a more physiologically relevant context, we developed cell-based occupancy assays that quantify the percentage of drug-inactivated kinases. Cellular selectivity of BTK over TEC was determined after MWCL-1 cells, and samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were treated for durations and concentrations based on human pharmacokinetics of each drug. In MWCL-1 cells, BTK/TEC selectivities measured at 0.5, 1, and 3 hours were 2.53, 1.05, and 1.51 for ibrutinib and 0.97, 1.13, and 2.56 for acalabrutinib, respectively. The equivalent selectivity measured in samples from patients with CLL were 1.31 +/- 0.27 and 1.09 +/- 0.11 for ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, respectively. Collectively, our data show that when properly accounting for time-dependent factors and relevant cellular context, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib demonstrate similar selectivity for BTK over TEC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study shows relative selectivity of covalent inhibitors toward different kinase targets should be assessed with both affinity and inactivation kinetics to accurately account for time-dependent effects of covalent binding and assessed in a cellular matrix to reproduce the physiologic context of target inhibition. This is illustrated with a case study of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib for which selectivity assessment with appropriate assays, as opposed to measuring binding affinity with KINOMEscan alone, corroborate emerging clinical data demonstrating similar safety profiles between the therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Hopper, Melissa', 'Gururaja, Tarikere', 'Kinoshita, Taisei', 'Dean, James P', 'Hill, Ronald J', 'Mongan, Ann']","['Hopper M', 'Gururaja T', 'Kinoshita T', 'Dean JP', 'Hill RJ', 'Mongan A']",,"['Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, California amongan@pcyc.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191223,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Tec protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,,,,2019/12/25 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.119.262063 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.119.262063 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2020 Mar;372(3):331-338. doi: 10.1124/jpet.119.262063.

Children's Oncology Group AAML05P1 is a prospective phase 2 trial of unrelated donor (URD) HSCT in which KIR typing of donors was available to the treating physician at donor selection, aiming to determine feasibility (defined as the ability to obtain donor samples from URDs and obtain KIR data before transplantation) of prospective selection of KIR-mismatched donors and effect on outcomes. Patients age </=30 years with high-risk AML at presentation or relapsed AML were eligible; the study accrued 90 evaluable patients. After enrollment, as many as 5 potential URD samples were KIR-typed (including gene expression) in a central laboratory and results reported to the treating physician, who made the final donor selection. Cases were categorized as KIR-matched or KIR-mismatched using different published strategies. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse did not differ significantly by KIR mismatch status. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly lower in recipients of KIR-mismatched stem cells (35% versus 60%; P=.027). We examined DFS according to time to natural killer (NK) receptor recovery after HSCT. NK p44 recovery was significantly associated with KIR mismatch and with decreased DFS and increased relapse risk in multivariate Cox analysis (P=.006 and .009, respectively). We show that prospective selection of URD according to KIR type was feasible, acute GVHD was reduced, but survival did not differ using any model of KIR mismatch. However, the study enrolled mostly matched transplants, so ligand-ligand mismatch was rare, and thus the sample size was insufficient to determine potential benefit according to this model. Cord blood recipients demonstrated a trend toward improved DFS with KIR mismatch, but the study was not powered to detect a difference in this small subset of patients. Our data suggest that recovery of NK receptor expression might influence DFS after HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

AIM: The study aim was to describe excess length of stay and costs associated with CDI during the hospital stay for induction chemotherapy in the United States (USA). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from US databases of Truven Health Analytics(R). Comprehensive hospitalization data of patients with induction chemotherapy due to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were analysed. Patients with CDI occurring during the hospital stay were compared to controls through a case-control comparison of the direct treatment costs and length of stay was performed with an exact matching algorithm. FINDINGS: A total of 2611 patients were included between January 2014 and December 2017. NHL (43.5%) and AML (38.4%) were the predominant underlying diseases and 15% of patients received a stem cell transplantation. During the matching, 105 CDI cases (CDI+) were compared with 801 controls (CDI-). On average, hospitalization costs were increased by US$36,113 in CDI+ compared to CDI- patients (P=0.009) and patients with CDI spent on average 8.9 additional days in hospital (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight a significant burden associated with CDI in haematological patients undergoing induction chemotherapy in the USA. There is an important need for prevention of CDI in this specific patient population.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Healthcare Infection Society.

The commercial asparaginases are obtained from bacteria Erwinia chrysanthemi and Escherichia coli now which had many side effects. In this study, the effects of a novel l-asparaginase from yeast Yarrowia lipolytica was investigated on human ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. The l-asparaginase causes metabolic stress, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis due to the arrest of the G0 cell cycle, the activation of caspase-3 and the modulation of mitochondrial membrane integrity. The RT-PCR analysis showed a significant increase in the pro-apoptosis genes such as Bax, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9 and p53 (P < 0.05) while the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, Y. lipolytical-asparaginase causes autophagy and increased ROS. The l-asparaginase has cytotoxic and anticancer effects higher than commercial asparaginase. In conclusion, Y. lipolytical-asparaginase shows interesting anticancer activity and it can be introduced as a new eukaryotic and therapeutic agent and strategy for ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma treatment after the in vivo and clinical experiments.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

BCL2L1 is a well-known glucocorticoid-responsive gene and a key apoptosis regulator that, when over-expressed, can contribute to tumor development, progression and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, synthetic glucocorticoids, like dexamethasone, are frequently used in the treatment of hematopoietic diseases due to its pro-apoptotic properties. We report here that the trithorax protein ASH2L, considered one of the core subunits of H3K4-specific MLL/SET methyltransferase complexes, contributes to anti-apoptotic BCL-XL over-expression and cell survival in patient-derived myeloid leukemia cells. We find that the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor (uGR) and ASH2L interact in a common protein complex through a chromatin looping determined by uGR and ASH2L binding to BCL2L1 specific +58 HRE and promoter region, respectively. Upon addition of dexamethasone, GR and ASH2L recruitment is reduced, BCL-XL expression diminishes and apoptosis is induced consequently. Overall, our findings indicate that uGR and ASH2L may act as key regulatory players of BCL- XL upregulation in AML cells.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Drugs that reverse epigenetic repression, such as 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), induce haematological improvement in half of treated patients. Although the mechanisms underlying therapy success are not yet clear, induction of endogenous retroelements (EREs) has been hypothesised. METHODS: Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we compared the transcription of EREs in bone marrow HSCs from a new cohort of MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) patients before and after 5-AZA treatment with HSCs from healthy donors and AML patients. We further examined ERE transcription using the most comprehensive annotation of ERE-overlapping transcripts expressed in HSCs, generated here by de novo transcript assembly and supported by full-length RNA-seq. RESULTS: Consistent with prior reports, we found that treatment with 5-AZA increased the representation of ERE-derived RNA-seq reads in the transcriptome. However, such increases were comparable between treatment responses and failures. The extended view of HSC transcriptional diversity offered by de novo transcript assembly argued against 5-AZA-responsive EREs as determinants of the outcome of therapy. Instead, it uncovered pre-treatment expression and alternative splicing of developmentally regulated gene transcripts as predictors of the response of MDS and CMML patients to 5-AZA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies the developmentally regulated transcriptional signatures of protein-coding and non-coding genes, rather than EREs, as correlates of a favourable response of MDS and CMML patients to 5-AZA treatment and offers novel candidates for further evaluation.",,"['Kazachenka, Anastasiya', 'Young, George R', 'Attig, Jan', 'Kordella, Chrysoula', 'Lamprianidou, Eleftheria', 'Zoulia, Emmanuela', 'Vrachiolias, George', 'Papoutselis, Menelaos', 'Bernard, Elsa', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Kazachenka A', 'Young GR', 'Attig J', 'Kordella C', 'Lamprianidou E', 'Zoulia E', 'Vrachiolias G', 'Papoutselis M', 'Bernard E', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Kassiotis G']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8457-2633'],"['Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London, NW1 1AT, UK.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, The Francis Crick Institute, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London, NW1 1AT, UK.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London, NW1 1AT, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Haematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Center for Heme Malignancies and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Center for Heme Malignancies and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London, NW1 1AT, UK. george.kassiotis@crick.ac.uk.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, W2 1PG, UK. george.kassiotis@crick.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FC001099/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '102898/B/13/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191223,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Retroelements)', '0 (TACC2 protein, human)', '0 (TBC1D10C protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Mannosyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy', 'Mannosyltransferases/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Transcriptome/drug effects', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",PMC6929315,,,,2019/12/25 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-019-0707-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13073-019-0707-x [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2019 Dec 23;11(1):86. doi: 10.1186/s13073-019-0707-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital and Dharmais Cancer Hospital, Jakarta using retrospective cohort design to analyse the association between the duration of HU before IM and its MMR achievement and cross-sectional design to analyse the association between MDA, HIF-1alpha and P-gp expressions with MMR achievement. Main subjects were chronic-phase CML patients treated by HU prior to IM for >/= 12 months and HU only. The subjects were divided into four main groups: (1) chronic-phase CML patients treated with HU </= 6 months + IM >/= 12 months and (2) HU > 6 months + IM >/= 12 months (3) HU only (</= 6 months), (4) HU only ( >6 months). Subjects were obtained from January 2015 to May 2016. Data were gathered through history taking, physical examination, medical record evaluation, and blood sample analysis. Bivariate analysis was conducted using chi square, independent T-test, and Mann-Whitney according to the variables. RESULTS: Administration of HU for more than 6 months prior to IM was associated with unsuccessful MMR achievement (RR 1.60; 95%CI 1.29-2.00). MDA level, HIF-1alpha, P-glycoprotein expression were not associated with MMR achievement but the mean MDA level (0.63+/-0.31 vs 0.75+/-0.41 p=0.461) and median P-glycoprotein expressions {16,92 (0,04 - 43,86) vs. 5,15 (0,02-39,64); p=0.311} were found to be higher in patients receiving HU for > 6 months group than in HU </= 6 months group consecutively.

AML is the most common type of acute leukemia that occurs in adults. In addition, AML progresses rapidly and is considered a fatal disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new targets for molecularly designed therapies. In This study, we evaluated the circulatory levels of microRNA-29a-3p (miR-29a-3p) and miR-92a-3p beside exploring the expression pattern of their target gene myeloid cell leukemia sequence1 (MCL1) to investigate the role of these molecules in AML pathophysiology and to assess their ability to diagnose AML patients. METHODS: 40 adult AML patients along with 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Plasma were separated from venous blood samples, collected on EDTA, of all individuals were used to assess circulating miRNAs' levels. In the meantime, total RNA was extracted from isolated leukocytes and was used to quantify target mRNA transcript levels. RESULTS: Our data revealed that the circulating levels of miR-29a-3p and miR-92a-3p exhibited significant reduction in 90% and 100% of AML patients, respectively, when compared to the control group (p<0.001). On the other hand, the transcript level of the target gene of these miRNAs, MCL1, showed a sharp increase in 77.5% (p<0.001) of AML patients, along with a negative correlation with its regulatory miRNAs, miR-29a-3p and miR-92a-3p. CONCLUSION: Our data validates the negative regulatory role of miR-29a-3p and miR-92a-3p to the expression levels of MCL1 in peripheral blood and indicates that these miRNAs can be used as non-invasive diagnostic markers. Furthermore, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of miR-29a-3p and miR-92a-3p to target and downregulate a very important gene (MCL1), which is highly implicated in the pathogenesis of AML.",,"['Gado, Marwa M', 'Mousa, Nahla O', 'Badawy, M A', 'El Taweel, Maha A', 'Osman, Ahmed']","['Gado MM', 'Mousa NO', 'Badawy MA', 'El Taweel MA', 'Osman A']",,"['Biotechnology/Biomolecular Chemistry program, Chemistry Department, faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Biotechnology/Biomolecular Chemistry program, Chemistry Department, faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Biotechnology Program, Biology Department, The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer institute, Cairo university, Giza, Egypt.', '5Biochemistry Department, faculty of science, Ain Shams university, Abbasyia, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biotechnology Program, Basic and Applied Sciences Institute, Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Borg Al Arab, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",PMC7173384,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MCL1', 'RNA', 'miRNAs', 'qPCR']",2019/12/25 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/12/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.12.3625 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2019 Dec 1;20(12):3625-3633. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.12.3625.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It alters a highly conserved amino acid valine in the negative regulatory JH2 domain to phenylalanine predicted to dysregulate kinase activity. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of JAK2 V617F mutation in various MPD's as well as in hematological malignancies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: JAK2 mutation was assessed in 90 patients with myeloproliferative disorders and 47 leukemic patients. In addition, peripheral blood samples from 90 healthy donors were also collected as control. We used a highly sensitive Allele-Specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) for the detection and confirmed the mutation further by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Our results showed significant differences between various disorders with respect to either the proportion of positivity or that of mutant alleles. JAK2-V617F was detected in 67/90 MPD patients and 02/17 for AML,01/11 for ALL-L1,02/12 for ALL-L2 and 02/07 for CML and 90 healthy controls. CONCLUSION: From the above findings it is evident that the JAK2 V617F mutation is widespread not only in MPD's but also in hematological malignancies, which might as well lead to the new classification of MPD'S.

Fifty-two cases with relapsed/refractory B-ALL who underwent allo-HSCT after CR by CD19 or CD22 CAR-T were enrolled. The median time from CAR-T infusion to allo-HSCT was 50 (34-98) days. Myeloablative reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with total body irradiation/fludarabine-based or busulfan/fludarabine-based regimens was used. Incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and severe aGVHD were 23.1% and 5.8% respectively. Of 48 evaluable cases, 16 developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and in three of them the pattern was extensive.

However, a major adverse side effect of ibrutinib is bleeding, including major hemorrhages. The bleeding associated with ibrutinib use is thought to be due to a combination of on-target irreversible Btk inhibition, as well as off-target inhibition of other kinases, including EGFR, ITK, JAK3, and Tec kinase. In this study, we investigated the effects of ibrutinib vs zanubrutinib (a more selective Btk inhibitor) on platelet activation, glycoprotein expression, and thrombus formation. Ibrutinib, but not zanubrutinib, induced a time- and dose-dependent shedding of GPIb-IX complex and integrin alphaIIbbeta3, but not of GPVI and GPV, from the platelet surface. The shedding of GPIbalpha and GPIX was blocked by GM6001 and TAPI-2, an ADAM17 inhibitor but not ADAM10 inhibitor. Ibrutinib but not zanubrutinib treatment of human platelets increased ADAM17 activation. Pretreatment of C57BL/6 mice with ibrutinib (10 mg/kg), but not zanubrutinib (10 mg/kg), inhibited ex vivo and in vivo thrombus growth over time. Platelets from ibrutinib-treated patients with CLL showed reduced GPIb-IX complex and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 surface expression and reduced ex vivo thrombus formation under arterial flow, which was not observed in zanubrutinib-treated patients. In mice, ibrutinib, but not zanubrutinib, led to increased soluble GPIbalpha and soluble alphaIIb levels in plasma. These data demonstrate that ibrutinib induces shedding of GPIbalpha and GPIX by an ADAM17-dependent mechanism and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 by an unknown sheddase, and this process occurs in vivo to regulate thrombus formation.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Dobie, Gasim', 'Kuriri, Fahd A', 'Omar, Musab M A', 'Alanazi, Fehaid', 'Gazwani, Ali M', 'Tang, Chloe P S', 'Sze, Daniel Man-Yuen', 'Handunnetti, Sasanka M', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Jackson, Denise E']","['Dobie G', 'Kuriri FA', 'Omar MMA', 'Alanazi F', 'Gazwani AM', 'Tang CPS', 'Sze DM', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Tam C', 'Jackson DE']",,"['Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Thrombosis and Vascular Diseases Laboratory, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Bundoora, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'AG9MHG098Z (zanubrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Exocytosis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/*metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'von Willebrand Factor/metabolism']",PMC6929381,,,,2019/12/24 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['429999 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000640 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Dec 23;3(24):4298-4311. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000640.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the effect of donor and host HLA on NK-cell reconstitution, single killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)+ NK cells (exhibiting KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3, or KIR3DL1 as their sole receptor) were grouped into 4 groups based on the interaction between donor/host HLA and donor inhibitory KIR in 2 cohorts (n = 114 and n = 276, respectively). On days 90 to 180 after transplantation, the absolute number and responsiveness against K562 cells (CD107a or interferon-gamma expression) of single-KIR+ NK cells were higher in pairs where donor and host HLA both expressed ligands for donor inhibitory KIRs than in pairs where 1 or both of the donor and recipient HLA lacked at least 1 KIR ligand. NK-cell responsiveness was tuned commensurate with the number of inhibitory receptors from the donor. When both donor and host expressed the 3 major KIR ligands (HLA-C1, HLA-C2, and HLA-Bw4), NK cells expressing 3 inhibitory receptors (KIR2DL1/2DL3/3DL1) reached the maximum responsiveness against K562 cells compared with those NK cells expressing only 1 or 2 inhibitory receptors. When donor and host HLA both expressed all ligands for donor inhibitory KIRs, patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) showed the lowest recurrence rate after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that when both donors and hosts present all the KIR ligands for donor KIRs, reconstituted NK cells achieve better functional education and contribute to least relapse among patients.

As predicted by this work, the use of venetoclax in the clinical setting has resulted in promising outcomes for patients with this disease. Although venetoclax showed limited activity as a single agent in the relapsed disease setting, recent studies have shown that when combined with a backbone therapy of a hypomethylating agent or low-dose cytarabine, high response rates with encouraging remission durations for older patients with newly diagnosed AML who were not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy were observed. Furthermore, venetoclax-based therapies allowed for rapid responses and were able to effectively target the leukemia stem cell population.

The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was quantified by flow cytometry in BM cell subsets as well as the expression level of 28 transcripts encoding for major enzymes involved in the antioxidant cellular response. Our results highlight increased ROS levels in BM nonlymphoid cells and especially in primitive CD34posCD38low progenitor cells. Moreover, we identified a specific antioxidant signature, dubbed ""antioxidogram,"" for the different MDS subgroups or secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia (sAML). Our results suggest that progression from MDS toward sAML could be characterized by 3 successive molecular steps: (1) overexpression of enzymes reducing proteic disulfide bonds (MDS with <5% BM blasts [GLRX family]); (2) increased expression of enzymes detoxifying H2O2 (MDS with 5% to 19% BM blasts [PRDX and GPX families]); and finally (3) decreased expression of these enzymes in sAML.

Following these recommendations, survival of CML patients has become very close to normal. The next, ambitious, step is to bring as many patients as possible into a condition of treatment-free remission (TFR). The Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA; Italian Group for Hematologic Diseases of the Adult) CML Working Party (WP) has developed a project aimed at selecting the treatment policies that may increase the probability of TFR, taking into account 4 variables: the need for TFR, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the characteristics of leukemia, and the patient. A Delphi-like method was used to reach a consensus among the representatives of 50 centers of the CML WP. A consensus was reached on the assessment of disease risk (EUTOS Long Term Survival [ELTS] score), on the definition of the most appropriate age boundaries for the choice of first-line treatment, on the choice of the TKI for first-line treatment, and on the definition of the responses that do not require a change of the TKI (BCR-ABL1 </=10% at 3 months, </=1% at 6 months, </=0.1% at 12 months, </=0.01% at 24 months), and of the responses that require a change of the TKI, when the goal is TFR (BCR-ABL1 >10% at 3 and 6 months, >1% at 12 months, and >0.1% at 24 months).

In a retrospective, observational study of 86 patients (2000-2013), we described clinical and biological data focusing on morphologies and immunophenotype. We found expression of markers associated with plasmacytoid dendritic cell origin (HLA-DRhigh, CD303+, CD304+, and cTCL1+) plus CD4 and CD56 and frequent expression of isolated markers from the myeloid, B-, and T-lymphoid lineages, whereas specific markers (myeloperoxidase, CD14, cCD3, CD19, and cCD22) were not expressed. Fifty-one percent of cytogenetic abnormalities impact chromosomes 13, 12, 9, and 15. Myelemia was associated with an adverse prognosis. We categorized chemotherapeutic regimens into 5 groups: acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-like, acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)-like, lymphoma (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP])-like, high-dose methotrexate with asparaginase (Aspa-MTX) chemotherapies, and not otherwise specified (NOS) treatments. Thirty patients received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), and 4 patients received autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. There was no difference in survival between patients receiving AML-like, ALL-like, or Aspa-MTX regimens; survival was longer in patients who received AML-like, ALL-like, or Aspa-MTX regimens than in those who received CHOP-like regimens or NOS. Eleven patients are in persistent complete remission after allo-HCT with a median survival of 49 months vs 8 for other patients. Our series confirms a high response rate with a lower toxicity profile with the Aspa-MTX regimen, offering the best chance of access to hematopoietic cell transplantation and a possible cure.",['(c)

We observed a variety of mutations among t-ALL patients, with the majority of patients exhibiting mutations that were more common with myeloid malignancies (eg, DNMT3A, RUNX1, ASXL1), whereas others had ALL-type mutations (eg, CDKN2A, IKZF1). Median overall survival was significantly shorter in the t-ALL cohort compared with patients with dn-ALL or pm-ALL.

The molecular effects of a single oncogenic hit, such as expression of the AML associated oncoprotein AML1-ETO on hematopoietic development and transformation into a (pre-) leukemic state still needs further investigation. Here we describe the development and characterization of an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system that allows in vitro differentiation towards different mature myeloid cell types such as monocytes and granulocytes. During in vitro differentiation we expressed the AML1-ETO fusion protein and examined the effects of the oncoprotein on differentiation and the underlying alterations in the gene program at 8 different time points. Our analysis revealed that AML1-ETO as a single oncogenic hit in a non-mutated background blocks granulocytic differentiation, deregulates the gene program via altering the acetylome of the differentiating granulocytic cells, and induces t(8;21) AML associated leukemic characteristics.

Patients who fail or are intolerant to IM therapy are treated with more expensive second and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients show wide variation in trough concentrations in response to standard dosing. Thus, many patients receive subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may improve dose management that, in turn, may reduce costs and improve outcomes. However, TDM also adds to the cost of patient care. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of TDM for generic IM therapy. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for the trough plasma concentration of IM which is related to a cytogenetic or molecular response. We compared two cohorts: one with TDM and one without TDM (NTDM). The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the effectiveness measure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The lifetime cost and QALY of treatment with TDM were $2,137K [95% Ci: 2,079K; 2,174K] and 12.37 [95% CI: 12.07; 12.55], respectively. The cost and QALY of NTDM were $2,132K [95% CI: 2,091K; 2,197K] and 12.23 [95% CI: 11.96; 12.50], respectively. The incremental cost and QALY for TDM relative to NTDM was $4,417 [95% CI: -52,582; 32,097]) and 0.15 [95% CI: -0.13; 0.28]. The ICER for TDM relative to NTDM was $30,450/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that TDM was cost-effective relative to NTDM in 90% of the tested scenarios at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although the impact of TDM is modest, the cost-effectiveness over a lifetime horizon (societal perspective, ($30,450/QALY) falls within the acceptable range (< $100k/QALY).",,"['Kim, Kibum', 'McMillin, Gwendolyn A', 'Bernard, Philip S', 'Tantravahi, Srinivas', 'Walker, Brandon S', 'Schmidt, Robert L']","['Kim K', 'McMillin GA', 'Bernard PS', 'Tantravahi S', 'Walker BS', 'Schmidt RL']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8676-7434'],"['Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Research Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191223,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Drugs, Generic)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/therapeutic use', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Monitoring/*economics/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/economics/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Drugs, Generic/economics/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics/epidemiology/genetics', 'Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC6927594,,,,2019/12/24 06:00,2020/04/16 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0226552 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-02445 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Dec 23;14(12):e0226552. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0226552. eCollection 2019.,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: For the investigation of a correlation between volume of services and quality of treatment outcome in haematopoietic SCT, a total of 4 registry studies were eligible for inclusion in the assessment. For 1 study, the informative value of results was rated as high. Among the outcomes relevant for the report, this study investigated only overall survival. As regards the outcome of overall survival, the results with high informative value show, for both transplantation types, a significant increase with rising volume of services on the level of the treating physician after up to 1 year. This positive correlation between the volume of services and quality of treatment outcome is also shown for a follow-up period of 8 years by studies with low informative value of results; these studies considered the volume of services at the transplantation centre level. For the other outcomes, only studies with low informative value of results were available. For the combined outcome of event-free survival after allogeneic SCT, a weak positive correlation between volume of services and event-free survival was derived only whenever the volume of services was defined disease-specifically for patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia. A weak positive correlation between volume of services and non-relapse mortality after allogeneic SCT can also be derived for a follow-up period of 8 years. For shorter follow-up periods, the observed correlations are even weaker. In addition, a weak positive correlation between volume of services and relapse-free survival was found for allogeneic or autologous SCT as well as between volume of services and occurrence of relapse/progression for autologous SCT. In comparison, the observed correlation between the outcome of occurrence of relapse/progression after 5 or 6 years of follow-up, respectively, was weaker for allogeneic SCT. No correlation was derived between volume of services and non-relapse mortality in autologous SCT or occurrence of relapse/progression in allogeneic SCT at a follow-up period of 8 years. The included studies did not provide any usable data or did not report any data on other outcomes, such as acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease or quality of life.

Currently, there is no effective treatment to promote the regeneration of the endometrium. Urinary bladder matrix (UBM) is a derivative extracellular matrix biomaterial that has a complete basement membrane and provides a basis for the body to achieve complete self-functional repair. In this study, UBM was transplanted into the uterine horns of intrauterine adhesions in Sprague-Dawley rats to test whether UBM could improve endometrial regeneration in rats with intrauterine adhesions. Thicker endometria, increased numbers of glands, fewer fibrotic areas and increased proliferation of cells and blood vessels were found in the UBM group compared to the injury group. Transplantation of UBM reduced the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and increased those of anti-inflammatory cytokines (basic fibroblast growth factor) compared to the injury group. In the UBM group, the mRNA expression of endometrial receptivity factors (leukemia inhibitory factor and integrin alphaVbeta3) was higher than that in the injury group, but it was lower than that in the normal group and the sham-operated group. More embryos were seen in the UBM group than in the injury group, although the UBM group had fewer embryos than the normal and sham-operated groups. Therefore, UBM may contribute to endometrial regeneration and may improve endometrial receptivity and fertility.",,"['Zhang, Honghong', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Sheng, Fei', 'Wu, Shuang', 'Yang, Fu', 'Li, Wen']","['Zhang H', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang J', 'Sheng F', 'Wu S', 'Yang F', 'Li W']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4956-8524'],"['Reproductive Medicine Center, Second Military Medical University, Changzheng Hospital, 415 Fengyang Road, Shanghai 200003, China. liwen@smmu.edu.cn.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Second Military Medical University, Changzheng Hospital, 415 Fengyang Road, Shanghai 200003, China. liwen@smmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Military Medical University, Changzheng Hospital, 415 Fengyang Road, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Second Military Medical University, Changzheng Hospital, 415 Fengyang Road, Shanghai 200003, China. liwen@smmu.edu.cn.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Second Military Medical University, Changzheng Hospital, 415 Fengyang Road, Shanghai 200003, China. liwen@smmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China. yangfusq1997@smmu.edu.cn.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Second Military Medical University, Changzheng Hospital, 415 Fengyang Road, Shanghai 200003, China. liwen@smmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191223,England,Biomater Sci,Biomaterials science,101593571,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Integrin alphaVbeta3)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endometrium/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Regeneration', 'Tissue Adhesions/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder/*metabolism', 'Uterine Diseases/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology']",,,,,2019/12/24 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9bm00651f [doi]'],ppublish,Biomater Sci. 2020 Feb 7;8(3):988-996. doi: 10.1039/c9bm00651f.

RESULTS: The QoL analysis of patients with AL at the time of initial diagnosis showed extremely low QoL level in all subgroups compared with healthy individuals. It should be noted that the level of patients' QoL after achieving remission remained significantly lower than those of practically healthy, which is primarily due to the need for further long-term treatment and, probably, the fear of the disease relapse development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall Latvian population representative data on B12 testing in 79,524 patients were obtained from laboratory database. The following exclusion criteria were applied: fluctuating B12 results within a three-month period, elevated (> 100 U/L) alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase, hepatitis (HAV, HBV, and HCV) infection, reduced glomerular filtration rate (< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2). As a control group, individuals with normal B12 level and any oncologic diagnosis (solid cancer or hematological malignancies) were selected. RESULTS: After application of step-by-step exclusion filters, 1,373 patients were left with significantly increased level of plasma B12 (> 1,700 pg/mL). Odds ratios for oncohematological diseases in total and myeloid leukemia (including acute, chronic and unspecified) in patient group with elevated B12 were found to be 6.0 (95% CI 4.7-7.6; p < 0.0001) and 19.2 (95% CI 13.1-28.0; p <0.0001), respectively, as compared to the control group.

The most frequent type of mutations leads to the expression of an N-terminally truncated variant of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), termed p30. While initial reports proposed that p30 represents a dominant-negative version of the wild-type C/EBPalpha protein, other studies show that p30 retains the capacity to actively regulate gene expression. Recent global transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses have advanced the understanding of the distinct roles of the p30 isoform in leukemogenesis. This review outlines direct and indirect effects of the C/EBPalpha p30 variant on oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and discusses how studies of N-terminal CEBPA mutations in AML can be extrapolated to identify novel gain-of-function features in oncoproteins that arise from recurrent truncating mutations in transcription factors.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Accordingly, deregulation of HOX genes can cause leukemia. However, despite of intensive research on the coding HOX genes, the role of the numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within the HOX clusters during hematopoiesis and their contribution to leukemogenesis are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the lncRNA HOXA10-AS, located antisense to HOXA10 and mir-196b in the HOXA cluster, is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as well as in KMT2A-rearranged and NPM1 mutated acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Using short hairpin RNA- and locked nucleic acid-conjugated chimeric antisense oligonucleotide (LNA-GapmeR)-mediated HOXA10-AS-knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated excision in vitro, we demonstrate that HOXA10-AS acts as an oncogene in KMT2A-rearranged AML. Moreover, HOXA10-AS knockdown severely impairs the leukemic growth of KMT2A-rearranged patient-derived xenografts in vivo, while high HOXA10-AS expression can serve as a marker of poor prognosis in AML patients. Lentiviral expression of HOXA10-AS blocks normal monocytic differentiation of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Mechanistically, we show that HOXA10-AS localizes in the cytoplasm and acts in trans to induce NF-kappaB target genes. In total, our data imply that the normally HSC-specific HOXA10-AS is an oncogenic lncRNA in KMT2A-r AML. Thus, it may also represent a potential therapeutic target in KMT2A-rearranged AML.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Al-Kershi, Sina', 'Bhayadia, Raj', 'Ng, Michelle', 'Verboon, Lonneke', 'Emmrich, Stephan', 'Gack, Lucie', 'Schwarzer, Adrian', 'Strowig, Till', 'Heckl, Dirk', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning']","['Al-Kershi S', 'Bhayadia R', 'Ng M', 'Verboon L', 'Emmrich S', 'Gack L', 'Schwarzer A', 'Strowig T', 'Heckl D', 'Klusmann JH']",,"['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and.', 'Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', '*RNA, Antisense', '*RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Transcriptome']",PMC6929382,,,,2019/12/24 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['429990 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019032029 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Dec 23;3(24):4252-4263. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019032029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current status of BLV infection of dairy cattle in Taiwan remains unclear. To evaluate BLV infection, anti-BLV gp51 antibody and proviral DNA were detected. Surprisingly, the seroprevalence of BLV at the animal and herd level was as high as 81.8% (540/660 cattle) and 99.1% (109/110 herds), respectively. Among 152 blood samples analyzed, 132 (86.8%) were detected as positive for BLV-proviral DNA. When the complete blood count (CBC) was taken into account, the white blood cell (WBC) number appears to be the factor with the highest predicted potential for BLV infection. Moreover, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the sensitivity and specificity are 72.0 and 75.0%, respectively, when the cut-off value of the WBC was set at 10.215 K/muL. Despite the co-circulation of genotype 1 and 3 in Taiwan, genotype 1 was much more prevalent (29/30). Taken together, due to the high prevalence of BLV, the identification of risk factors for interrupting the routes of transmission of BLV are critical for the control and prevention of further BLV infection.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Hsieh, Li, Hsu and Chuang.']","['Hsieh, Jui-Chun', 'Li, Chang-Yan', 'Hsu, Wei-Li', 'Chuang, Shih-Te']","['Hsieh JC', 'Li CY', 'Hsu WL', 'Chuang ST']",,"['Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Microbiology and Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191206,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,,,PMC6908947,,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukemia virus', 'dairy cattle', 'genotype', 'proviral DNA', 'seroprevalence']",2019/12/24 06:00,2019/12/24 06:01,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2019.00427 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2019 Dec 6;6:427. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2019.00427. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of opportunistic infections in 127 HTLV-1 carriers and 153 ATL patients between 2006 and 2016. The cumulative incidence rates of opportunistic infections among HTLV-1 carriers and ATL patients were 1.5% (2/127) and 6.5% (10/153), respectively. The etiology of opportunistic infections was as follows: fungal infections (3 cases), pneumocystis pneumonia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Even after aggressive treatment, the prognosis of opportunistic infections was poor (50% of overall survival at 28 days). Regarding prognostic factors affecting the OS of opportunistic infections, higher SOFA scores (especially the respiratory subscore) and higher LDH values were identified by univariate analysis. Moreover, 3 out of 6 patients achieved spontaneous remission of ATL as the short-term outcome after the development of opportunistic infection. However, 5 out of 6 surviving patients exhibited ATL progression or relapse after a median of 194 days (133-226) after contracting an opportunistic infection as the long-term outcome of ATL.

High-throughput sequencing of the largest series (n = 24) of paired myeloid sarcomas and bone marrow biopsies was performed. One third of myeloid sarcomas (8/24) showed discordant molecular profiles, and 75% (n = 6) of these cases had discordant mutations in genes with prognostic significance or molecularly targeted therapies.

Aggregated data on risks of Ommaya placement among thrombocytopenic patients are lacking. This study assesses complications, revision rates, and costs associated with Ommaya placement among patients with thrombocytopenia in a large population sample. METHODS: Using a national administrative database, this retrospective study identifies a cohort of adult patients with cancer who underwent Ommaya placement between 2007 and 2016. Preoperative thrombocytopenia was defined as diagnosis of secondary thrombocytopenia, bleeding event, procedure to control bleeding, or platelet transfusion, within 30 days before index admission. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess costs, 30-day complications, readmissions, and revisions among patients with and without preoperative thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: The analytic cohort included 1652 patients, of whom 29.3% met criteria for preoperative thrombocytopenia. In-hospital mortality rates were 7.7% among patients thrombocytopenia with versus 1.2% among patients without thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001). Preoperative thrombocytopenia was associated with 14.5 times greater hazard of intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days following Ommaya placement, occurring in 25.6% versus 2.0% of patients with and without thrombocytopenia, respectively (P < 0.014). Revision rates did not differ significantly between patients with and without thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was associated with longer length of stay (7.4 vs. 13.9 days, P < 0.001) and additional $10,000 per patient in costs of index hospitalization (P < 0.001).

While a number of methods have been proposed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a tumor from DNA sequencing data, it is not clear how aspects of the sequencing data and tumor itself affect these reconstructions. METHODS: We investigate when and how well these histories can be reconstructed from multi-sample bulk sequencing data when considering only single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Specifically, we examine the space of all possible tumor phylogenies under the infinite sites assumption (ISA) using several approaches for enumerating phylogenies consistent with the sequencing data. RESULTS: On noisy simulated data, we find that the ISA is often violated and that low coverage and high noise make it more difficult to identify phylogenies. Additionally, we find that evolutionary trees with branching topologies are easier to reconstruct accurately. We also apply our reconstruction methods to both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets and confirm that ISA violations are common in practice, especially in lower-coverage sequencing data. Nonetheless, we show that an ISA-based approach can be relaxed to produce high-quality phylogenies. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of practical aspects of sequencing data such as coverage or the model of tumor evolution (branching, linear, etc.) is essential to effectively using the output of tumor phylogeny inference methods.

This disease comprises roughly 15% of all leukemias in adults. It is a clonal stem cell disorder of myeloid cells characterized by the presence of t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, also known as the Philadelphia chromosome, or its byproducts BCR-ABL fusion protein/messenger RNA, leading to the expression of a protein with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. This fusion protein has become the main therapeutic target in chronic myeloid leukemia therapy, with imatinib displaying superior antileukemic effects, placing it at the forefront of current treatment protocols and displaying great efficacy. Alternatively, nanomedicine and employing nanoparticles as drug delivery systems may represent new approaches in future anticancer therapy. This review focuses primarily on the use of organic nanoparticles aimed at chronic myeloid leukemia therapy in both in vitro and in vivo settings, by going through a thorough survey of published literature. After a brief introduction on the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, a description of conventional, first- and second-line, treatment modalities of chronic myeloid leukemia is presented. Finally, some of the general applications of nanostrategies in medicine are presented, with a detailed focus on organic nanocarriers and their constituents used in chronic myeloid leukemia treatment from the literature.",,"['Hussein Kamareddine, Mohammed', 'Ghosn, Youssef', 'Tawk, Antonios', 'Elia, Carlos', 'Alam, Walid', 'Makdessi, Joseph', 'Farhat, Said']","['Hussein Kamareddine M', 'Ghosn Y', 'Tawk A', 'Elia C', 'Alam W', 'Makdessi J', 'Farhat S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1749-6797', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8071-4681']","['Faculty of Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of Balamand, El-Koura, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of Balamand, El-Koura, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of Balamand, El-Koura, Lebanon.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Balamand, El-Koura, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of Balamand, El-Koura, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, Achrafieh-Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/classification', 'Organic Chemicals/*chemistry', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Theranostic Nanomedicine']",PMC6928535,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*drug delivery systems', '*multidrug resistance', '*nanomedicine', '*organic nanoparticles']",2019/12/24 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033819879902 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2019 Jan-Dec;18:1533033819879902. doi: 10.1177/1533033819879902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little data of venetoclax's use has been published in plasma cell leukemia. We present a case of a refractory/relapsed sPCL patient displaying t(11,14) who achieved a very good partial response (VGPR) from venetoclax therapy in combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib. CASE REPORT: Our case describes a 67-year-old male initially diagnosed with IgG kappa MM in 2013, which transformed into non-secretory secondary plasma cell leukemia. Over a two-year period, despite responses to various therapies, the patient continued to experience relapses and exhausted options of novel agents seen in MM treatment. The patient was started on venetoclax in combination with bortezomib and oral dexamethasone. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Due to the patient's disease transformation into a non-secretory form of sPCL, PET/CT scans were relied upon to monitor disease progression. The PET/CT scan after three months of venetoclax combination treatment showed a very good partial response to therapy, with near resolution of metabolically active osseous disease. DISCUSSION: The success of venetoclax-based therapy in achieving a very good partial response suggests its utility in relapsed/refractory sPCL patients, who have exhausted various combinations of drug regimens used in treatment of MM and have historically poor survival outcomes.",,"['Kupsh, Allison', 'Arnall, Justin', 'Voorhees, Peter']","['Kupsh A', 'Arnall J', 'Voorhees P']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6120-614X'],"['Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Division, University of Washington Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Division, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'Plasma Cell Disorders, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, NC, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191222,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Multiple myeloma', 'secondary plasma cell leukemia', 'venetoclax']",2019/12/24 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/12/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219895072 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Jul;26(5):1274-1278. doi: 10.1177/1078155219895072.

These infections are mainly due to Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. Mortality by these infections is high, but rates have descended in the latest series due to better antifungal agents. Echinocan-dins are, in vitro, very active against Candida and Aspergillus spp. The objective of the study is to analyse the ef fi cacy and safety of micafungin in the antifungal prophylaxis of haema-tological patients on chemotherapy. METHODS: A multicentre, observational retrospective study was performed in 7 Haematology Depart-ments in Spain. Patients admitted to these departments with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment, and who had received antifungal prophylaxis with micafungin between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014 were included. RESULTS: There were 5 cases of probable or proven fun-gal infection (4.8%) according to the 2008 EORTC criteria: 2 proven, 3 probable. The types of fungal infection were 3 as-pergillosis and 2 candidiasis. There were no drop-outs from the prophylaxis with micafungin due to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Micafungin is an antifungal agent which, used in prophylaxis, has demonstrated good ef fi cacy and an excellent toxicity pro fi le, making it an apparently interesting option in patients requiring antifungal prophylaxis during their hospitalisation episode.","['(c)The Author 2020.

We here evaluated PCDH17 mRNA expression in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL. PCDH17 mRNA expression levels in children with ALL/AML were lower than those in healthy counterparts. We next elucidated the mechanism underlying down-regulation of PCDH17 mRNA, using myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in restoration of PCDH17 mRNA expression and growth inhibition in K562, HL60, REH, and RCH-ACV cell lines. Upregulation of PCDH17 mRNA expression resulted from histone H3 acetylation. Knockdown of the PCDH17 gene, caused by transduction of PCDH17-targeted shRNA, significantly enhanced the proliferation of KU812 cells. Meanwhile, overexpression of PCDH17 via retroviral-particle transfection substantially inhibited the growth of Kasumi1 cells. The fold-increase in PCDH17 mRNA expression mediated by 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, was fundamentally lower than that produced by TSA. In conclusion, our results suggest that PCDH17 gene functions as a common tumor suppressor gene in leukemic cells, and that histone deacetylase inhibitors re-express PCDH17 mRNA to a greater extent than demethylation reagents.",,"['Thanh Nha Uyen, Le', 'Amano, Yuji', ""Al-Kzayer, Lika'a Fasih Y"", 'Kubota, Noriko', 'Kobayashi, Jun', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Sakashita, Kazuo']","['Thanh Nha Uyen L', 'Amano Y', 'Al-Kzayer LFY', 'Kubota N', 'Kobayashi J', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Koike K', 'Sakashita K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7331-7952'],"['Department of Medical Genetics, Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hue, Vietnam.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto,, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto,, Nagano, Japan.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto,, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto,, Nagano, Japan.', 'Shinonoi General Hospital, Minami Nagano Center, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto,, Nagano, Japan. sakasita@shinshu-u.ac.jp.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, 3100 Toyoshina, Azumino, Nagano, Japan. sakasita@shinshu-u.ac.jp.""]",['eng'],"['15H04874/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '17K10105/Japan Society for the promotion of Science']",['Journal Article'],20191221,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (PCDH17 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Cadherins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Histone acetylation', 'Leukemia', 'PCDH17 gene', 'Protocadherin']",2019/12/23 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/12/23 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02799-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02799-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Mar;111(3):451-462. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02799-4.

To date, there is no commonly agreed-on regimen for patients who are ineligible for this therapy because of cardiac comorbidities or prior exposure to anthracyclines. We compared 3 anthracycline-free regimens currently used in France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML were treated intensively in 3 French centers. All patients had at least one contraindication to the receipt of anthracyclines. Three regimen types were used: fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (FLAG); clofarabine and cytarabine (CLARA); and topotecan plus cytarabine (TA). RESULTS: Thirty patients (58%) had de novo AML. The European LeukemiaNet 2013 risk categories were favorable, intermediate, and adverse in 4 (8%), 27 (52%), and 20 (39%) patients, respectively. Twenty-four patients received TA and 28 FLAG/CLARA regimens. Fifty percent of patients had cardiac dysfunction, and 50% had prior anthracycline exposure above the maximum tolerated dose. The rate of cardiac events was similar after TA (17%) and FLAG/CLARA (25%) (P = .78). The 5-year nonrelapse mortality was 17.9% and 12.5% in the TA and FLAG/CLARA groups, respectively (P = .59). In patients with previously untreated AML, complete response occurred in 18 (72%) of 25, but median overall survival was only 9.7 months. CONCLUSION: TA, FLAG, and CLARA regimens are efficient and are associated with acceptable toxicity in AML patients ineligible for the 3 + 7 regimen as a result of cardiac comorbidities. However, long-term outcome remains disappointing, thereby highlighting the need for the development of less toxic regimens.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The exact mechanism(s) through which latency and disease progression are regulated are not fully understood. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an 11-zinc finger, sequence-specific, DNA-binding protein with thousands of binding sites throughout mammalian genomes. CTCF has been shown to play a role in organization of higher-order chromatin structure, gene expression, genomic imprinting, and serve as a barrier to epigenetic modification. A viral CTCF-binding site (vCTCF-BS) was previously identified within the overlapping p12 (sense) and Hbz (antisense) genes of the HTLV-1 genome. Thus, upon integration, HTLV-1 randomly inserts a vCTCF-BS into the host genome. vCTCF-BS studies to date have focused primarily on HTLV-1 chronically infected or tumor-derived cell lines. In these studies, HTLV-1 was shown to alter the structure and transcription of the surrounding host chromatin through the newly inserted vCTCF-BS. However, the effects of CTCF binding in the early stages of HTLV-1 infection remains unexplored. This study examines the effects of the vCTCF-BS on HTLV-1-induced in vitro immortalization and in vivo viral persistence in infected rabbits. RESULTS: HTLV-1 and HTLV-1CTCF LTR-transactivation, viral particle production, and immortalization capacity were comparable in vitro. The total lymphocyte count, proviral load, and Hbz gene expression were not significantly different between HTLV-1 and HTLV-1CTCF-infected rabbits throughout a 12 week study. However, HTLV-1CTCF-infected rabbits displayed a significantly decreased HTLV-1-specific antibody response compared to HTLV-1-infected rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of the HTLV-1 vCTCF-BS does not significantly alter T-lymphocyte transformation capacity or early in vivo virus persistence, but results in a decreased HTLV-1-specific antibody response during early infection in rabbits. Ultimately, understanding epigenetic regulation of HTLV-1 gene expression and pathogenesis could provide meaningful insights into mechanisms of immune evasion and novel therapeutic targets.",,"['Martinez, Michael P', 'Cheng, Xiaogang', 'Joseph, Ancy', 'Al-Saleem, Jacob', 'Panfil, Amanda R', 'Palettas, Marilly', 'Dirksen, Wessel P', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Martinez MP', 'Cheng X', 'Joseph A', 'Al-Saleem J', 'Panfil AR', 'Palettas M', 'Dirksen WP', 'Ratner L', 'Green PL']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0204-562X'],"['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. green.466@osu.edu.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. green.466@osu.edu.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. green.466@osu.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI126652/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191221,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (Chromatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Male', 'Rabbits', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology']",PMC6925871,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CTCF', '*HTLV-1', '*Immortalization', '*Persistence', '*Retrovirus']",2019/12/23 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/12/23 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0507-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0507-9 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Dec 21;16(1):44. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0507-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many efforts have been made to standardize the BCR-ABL1 testing assay, including the primary and secondary reference reagents, but the secondary standards have not been developed and used in the standardization program in China. With the use of armored RNA technology, armored RNA of BCR-ABL1 and control genes was manufactured to prepare the secondary reference material anchored to the World Health Organization primary reference calibrators for standardization of BCR-ABL1 testing assays. The secondary reference was sent to 30 laboratories in China for validation. Data from an external quality assessment after the standardization process were collected and analyzed as well. The assigned %BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) values of the four levels of the secondary material panels were 0.0118, 0.1345, 1.3808, and 19.4266, respectively. In validation trials, 70.0% (21/30) of laboratories obtained valid conversion factors for the BCR-ABL1 assay. All valid conversion factors from 11 international scale laboratories were equivalent to their respective previous values. External quality assessment data indicated that the accuracy and precision between laboratories were improved. Moreover, the quantity of the panels is abundant to be used as quality control samples for monitoring the shift of data. In this study, we established a secondary genetic reference panel for BCR-ABL1 quantification. This study will play a role in facilitating the worldwide dissemination of the international scale, especially in promoting the standardization of molecular monitoring in China.","['Copyright (c) 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The Raf serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase isoforms including B-Raf and RAF1, are the upstream in the MAPK cascade that play essential functions in regulating cellular proliferation and survival. Activated autophagy-related genes have a dual role in both cell death and cell survival in cancer cells. The cytotoxic activities of arsenic trioxide (ATO) were widely assessed in many cancers. Sorafenib is known as a multikinase inhibitor which acts through suppression of Ser/Thr kinase Raf that was reported to have a key role in tumor cell signaling, proliferation, and angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the combination effect of ATO and sorafenib in AML cell lines. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we studied in vitro effects of ATO and sorafenib on human leukemia cell lines. The effective concentrations of compounds were determined by MTT assay in both single and combination treatments. Apoptosis was evaluated by annexin-V FITC staining. Finally, mRNA levels of apoptotic and autophagy genes were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Data demonstrated that sorafenib, ATO, and their combination significantly increase the number of apoptotic cells. We found that the combination of ATO and sorafenib significantly reduces the viability of U937 and KG-1 cells. The expression level of selective autophagy genes, ULK1 and Beclin1 decreased but LC3-II increased in U937. Conclusion: The expression levels of apoptotic and autophagy activator genes were increased in response to treatment.

We hypothesized that treating APL patients using generic ATO (APL-ATO) will be cost effective compared to the chemotherapy-based regimen (APL-CT). In a single-centre retrospective study, we used a bottom-up costing method to compare the direct medical cost of treatment and HRU between APL-ATO and APL-CT. These costs and the survival and relapse probabilities were imputed in a three-state Markov decision model to estimate the cost effectiveness of APL-ATO compared to APL-CT. The mean cost of treatment for APL-ATO (n = 30, $8500 +/- 2078) was significantly less than for APL-CT (n = 30, $22 600 +/- 5528) (P < 0.001).

Secondary AML (sAML) is a heterogeneous disease, both biologically and clinically, even within the World Health Organization subgroups of sAML. Outcomes are the poorest in subgroups with sAML arising from an antecedent haematologic disorder which has been previously treated (ts-AML), and sAML in patients <55 years of age. This review describes the suboptimal outcomes of contemporary therapy, to support the notion of an unmet need for innovative treatment strategies in sAML. Despite the recent approval of CPX-351, long-term outcomes for this high-risk disease remain dismal. Resistance mechanisms to intensive chemotherapy contribute to relapse. Targeted immune therapy may avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms, but are unlikely to provide long-term remission due to a complex and rapidly evolving clonal disease profile. Advances for sAML will likely be accomplished by CAR T cell therapy or bispecific antibodies providing a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

The prism through which we can now disperse a patient's leukaemia, interpret and apply our understanding has fundamentally changed since the completion of the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of an AML patient in 2008 and where possible, many clinicians would now prefer to delay treatment decisions until the karyotype and genetic status of a new patient is known. The success of global sequencing initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have brought us significantly closer to cataloguing the full spectrum of coding mutations involved in human malignancy. Indeed, genetic capability has raced ahead of our capacity to apply much of this knowledge into clinical practice and we are in the peculiar position of having routine access to genetic information on an individual patient's leukaemia that cannot be reliably interpreted or utilised. This is a measure of how rapid the progress has been, and this rate of change is likely to continue into the foreseeable future as research intensifies on the non-coding genome and the epigenome, as we scrutinise disease at a single cell level, and as initiatives like Beat AML and the Harmony Alliance progress. In this review, we will examine how interrogation of the coding genome is revolutionising our understanding of AML and improving our ability to underscore differences between paediatric and adult onset, sporadic and inherited forms of disease.

Patients with lighter body weight (</= 64 kg) and older age (> 43 years) experienced a markedly higher occurrence of first DLTs by 12 months than heavier and younger patients (57.9% vs. 30.1%, p < 0.001).

Female patients achieved a greater rate of MMR than male patients (45.6% vs. 35.5%, p = 0.028). In conclusion, patients with light weight and old age are more vulnerable to DLTs, whereas female patients gain more efficacy benefit at the fixed dose.

These receptors are activated by extracellular nucleotides released from different sources. In the hematopoietic niche, the release of purines and pyrimidines in the milieu by lytic and nonlytic mechanisms has been described. The expression of P2 receptors from HSCs until maturity is still intriguing scientists. Several reports have shown the participation of P2 receptors in events associated with modulation of the immune system, but their participation in other physiological processes is under investigation. The presence of P2 receptors in HSCs and their ability to modulate this population have awakened interest in exploring the involvement of P2 receptors in hematopoiesis and their participation in hematopoietic disorders. Among the P2 receptors, the receptor P2X7 is of particular interest, because of its different roles in hematopoietic cells (e.g., infection, inflammation, cell death and survival, leukemias and lymphomas), making the P2X7 receptor a promising pharmacological target. Additionally, the role of P2Y12 receptor in platelet activation has been well-documented and is the main example of the importance of the pharmacological modulation of P2 receptor activity. In this review, we focus on the role of P2 receptors in the hematopoietic system, addressing these receptors as potential pharmacological targets.",,"['Filippin, Kelly Juliana', 'de Souza, Kamylla F S', 'de Araujo Junior, Roberto Theodoro', 'Torquato, Heron Fernandes Vieira', 'Dias, Dhebora Albuquerque', 'Parisotto, Eduardo Benedetti', 'Ferreira, Alice Teixeira', 'Paredes-Gamero, Edgar J']","['Filippin KJ', 'de Souza KFS', 'de Araujo Junior RT', 'Torquato HFV', 'Dias DA', 'Parisotto EB', 'Ferreira AT', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3686-8402'],"['Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Alimentos e Nutricao, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, 79070-900, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, R.

Activation of PI3K, NF-kappaB, and/or MYC has been linked to residual disease and/or resistance in ibrutinib-treated patients. These pathways can be targeted by inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins. Here we report about the preclinical activity of GS-5829, a novel BET inhibitor, in CLL. GS-5829 inhibited CLL cell proliferation and induced leukemia cell apoptosis through deregulation of key signaling pathways, such as BLK, AKT, ERK1/2, and MYC. IkappaBalpha modulation indicates that GS-5829 also inhibited NF-kappaB signaling. GS-5829-induced apoptosis resulted from an imbalance between positive (BIM) and negative regulators (BCL-XL) of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The antileukemia activity of GS-5829 increased synergistically in combinations with B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, the PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib, and the SYK inhibitor entospletinib. In cocultures that mimic the lymph node microenvironment, GS-5829 inhibited signaling pathways within nurselike cells and their growth, indicating that BET inhibitors also can target the supportive CLL microenvironment.

Previously, we showed that overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), arising from constitutive activation of NOX2 oxidase, occurs in >60% of patients with AML and that ROS production promotes proliferation of AML cells. We show here that the process most significantly affected by ROS overproduction is glycolysis. Whole metabolome analysis of 20 human primary AML showed that blasts generating high levels of ROS have increased glucose uptake and correspondingly increased glucose metabolism. In support of this, exogenous ROS increased glucose consumption while inhibition of NOX2 oxidase decreased glucose consumption. Mechanistically, ROS promoted uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) protein expression and phosphorylation of AMPK, upregulating the expression of a key regulatory glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3). Overexpression of PFKFB3 promoted glucose uptake and cell proliferation, whereas downregulation of PFKFB3 strongly suppressed leukemia growth both in vitro and in vivo in the NSG model. These experiments provide direct evidence that oxidase-derived ROS promotes the growth of leukemia cells via the glycolytic regulator PFKFB3. Targeting PFKFB3 may therefore present a new mode of therapy for this disease with a poor outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that ROS generated by NOX2 in AML cells promotes glycolysis by activating PFKFB3 and suggest PFKFB3 as a novel therapeutic target in AML.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Robinson, Andrew J', 'Hopkins, Goitseone L', 'Rastogi, Namrata', 'Hodges, Marie', 'Doyle, Michelle', 'Davies, Sara', 'Hole, Paul S', 'Omidvar, Nader', 'Darley, Richard L', 'Tonks, Alex']","['Robinson AJ', 'Hopkins GL', 'Rastogi N', 'Hodges M', 'Doyle M', 'Davies S', 'Hole PS', 'Omidvar N', 'Darley RL', 'Tonks A']",,"['Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff Experimental and Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC), School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff Experimental and Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC), School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom.

Whereas the isoforms of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A1 and eEF1A2) are implicated in different tumors, no information are available in CLL. METHODS: eEF1A1/eEF1A2 amounts were quantitated in the lymphocytes of 46 CLL patients vs normal control (real time PCR, western blotting). eEF1A1 role in CLL was investigated in a cellular (MEC-1) and animal model of CLL via its targeting by an aptamer (GT75) or a siRNA (siA1) delivered by electroporation (in vitro) or lipofection (in vivo). RESULTS: eEF1A1/eEF1A2 were elevated in CLL lymphocytes vs control. eEF1A1 but not eEF1A2 levels were higher in patients which died during the study compared to those surviving. eEF1A1 targeting (GT75/siA1) resulted in MEC-1 viability reduction/autophagy stimulation and in vivo tumor growth down-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of eEF1A1 in dead vs surviving patients may confer to eEF1A1 the role of a prognostic marker for CLL and possibly of a therapeutic target, given its involvement in MEC-1 survival.

Previous studies focused on the nuclear unspliced HOTAIRM1 transcript, however cytoplasmic splice variants exist whose roles have remained unknown. Here, we report novel functions of HOTAIRM1 in the kidney. HOTAIRM1 transcripts are induced during renal lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells and required for expression of specific renal differentiation genes. We show that the major HOTAIRM1 transcript in differentiated cells is the spliced cytoplasmic HM1-3 isoform and that HM1-3 is downregulated in >90% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Knockdown of HM1-3 in renal cells deregulates hypoxia-responsive and angiogenic genes, including ANGPTL4. Furthermore, HOTAIRM1 transcripts are downregulated by hypoxia-mimetic stress and knockdown of the cytoplasmic HM1-3 isoform in normoxic cells post-transcriptionally induces Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) protein, a key activator of ANGPTL4. Our results demonstrate the pervasive downregulation of the specific HOTAIRM1 cytoplasmic isoform HM1-3 in ccRCC and suggest possible roles of HOTAIRM1 in kidney differentiation and suppression of HIF1-dependent angiogenic pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cutting-edge science was presented in two main scientific sessions: i) pre-clinical evidences and new targets, and ii) clinical translation. The Keynote lecture entitled ""Cancer stem cells (CSCs): metabolic strategies for their identification and eradication"" presented by M. Lisanti, was one of the highlights of the conference. One key concept of the meeting was how the continuous advances in our knowledge about molecular mechanisms in various fields of research (cancer metabolism reprogramming, epigenetic regulation, transformation/invasiveness, and immunology, among others) are driving cancer research towards more effective personalized antineoplastic strategies. Specifically, recent preclinical data on the following topics were discussed: 1. Polycomb group proteins in cancer; 2. A d16HER2 splice variant is a flag of HER2 addiction across HER2-positive cancers; 3. Studying chromatin as a nexus between translational and basic research; 4. Metabolomic analysis in cancer patients; 5. CDK4-6 cyclin inhibitors: clinical activity and future perspectives as immunotherapy adjuvant; and 6. Cancer stem cells (CSCs): metabolic strategies for their identification and eradication. In terms of clinical translation, several novel approaches were presented: 1. Developing CAR-T cell therapies: an update of preclinical and clinical development at University of North Carolina; 2. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell activation and immune suppression in multiple myeloma; 3. Predictive biomarkers for real-world immunotherapy: the cancer immunogram model in the clinical arena; and 4. Mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in solid tumors.

Older patients with AML are less likely to be candidates for or to benefit from intensive chemotherapy. Patients deemed ineligible for intensive therapy may nevertheless benefit from lower-intensity therapies and from newly available targeted AML treatments. Recently approved lower-intensity treatments for AML include enasidenib, ivosidenib, glasdegib, venetoclax, midostaurin, and gilteritinib, and additional promising agents are in later stages of clinical development. Noncytotoxic agents may result in slower kinetics of therapeutic activity compared to intensive regimens, and although they are generally better tolerated than intensive chemotherapy, bone marrow responses are less frequent and may take longer to achieve. Notably, newer therapies might have been considered ineffective had they been judged solely by 2003 International Working Group response criteria for AML, which were based on experience with intensive regimens in predominantly younger patients. Lower-intensity therapies may require several treatment cycles to induce responses, and failure to achieve rapid morphologic remission may not signal the need for treatment cessation or transition to alternative therapies. Additionally, even in the absence of a conventional complete remission, lower-intensity therapies may provide meaningful clinical benefit, including improved survival and quality of life, by inducing hematologic improvement and transfusion independence. Reviewed here are the mechanisms of activity and response kinetics of lower-intensity AML therapies, as well as the clinical benefits resulting from nontraditional AML responses.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Within the microenvironment, tumor cells shape the T-cell compartment, which in turn supports tumor growth and survival. Targeting BCR signaling using Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) has become a highly successful treatment modality for CLL. Ibrutinib, the first-in-class BTKi, also inhibits Tec family kinases such as interleukin-2-inducible kinase (ITK), a proximal member of the T-cell receptor signaling cascade. It is increasingly recognized that ibrutinib modulates the T-cell compartment of patients with CLL. Understanding these T-cell changes is important for immunotherapy-based approaches aiming to increase the depth of response and to prevent or treat the emergence of resistant disease. Ibrutinib has been shown to improve T-cell function in CLL, resulting in the expansion of memory T cells, Th1 polarization, reduced expression of inhibitory receptors and improved immune synapse formation between T cells and CLL cells. Investigating the modulation of BTKi on the T-cell antitumoral function, and having a more complete understanding of changes in T cell behavior and function during treatment with BTKi therapy will inform the design of immunotherapy-based combination approaches and increase the efficacy of CLL therapy.",,"['Mhibik, Maissa', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Sun, Clare']","['Mhibik M', 'Wiestner A', 'Sun C']",,"['Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191220,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",PMC6981459,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'T-cell', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'combination strategies', 'immunotherapy', 'microenvironment']",2019/12/22 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/12/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21010068 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21010068 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 20;21(1). pii: ijms21010068. doi: 10.3390/ijms21010068.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This theory revolutionised our view to reflect that cancer consists of a hierarchy of cells that mimic normal cell development. Elegant studies of twins who both developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood revealed that at least two genomic insults are required for cancer to develop. These 'hits' do not appear to confer a growth advantage to cancer cells, nor do cancer cells appear to be better equipped to survive than normal cells. Cancer cells created by investigators by introducing specific genomic insults generally belong to one cell lineage. For example, transgenic mice in which the LIM-only 2 (LMO2,associated with human acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia) and BCR-ABL(p210) (associated with human chronic myeloid leukaemia) oncogenes were active solely within the haematopoietic stem-cell compartment developed T-lymphocyte and neutrophil lineage-restricted leukaemia, respectively. This recapitulated the human form of these diseases. This 'hardwiring' of lineage affiliation, either throughout leukaemic stem cell development or at a particular stage, is different to the behaviour of normal haematopoietic stem cells. While normal cells directly commit to a developmental pathway, they also remain versatile and can develop into a terminally differentiated cell that is not part of the initial lineage. Many cancer stem cells do not have this versatility, and this is an essential difference between normal and cancer stem cells.

A molecular modeling simulation on a dataset of 23 compounds, all of which comply with Lipinski's rules and have a structure analogous to ellipticine, was performed using the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) technique, followed by a detailed docking study on three different proteins significantly involved in this disease (PDB IDs: SYK, PI3K and BTK). As a result, a model with only four descriptors (HOMO, softness, AC1RABAMBID, and TS1KFABMID) was found to be robust enough for prediction of the antileukemia activity of the compounds studied in this work, with an R(2) of 0.899 and Q(2) of 0.730.

In the past, we addressed this issue in K562 cells, a cellular model of the human chronic myeloid leukemia. Here, we applied stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) proteomics with the aim to increase knowledge on the regulative and metabolic pathways modulated by quercetin in these cells. After 24 h of quercetin treatment, we observed that apoptosis was not completely established, thus we selected this time range to capture quantitative data. As a result, we were able to achieve a robust identification of 1703 proteins, and to measure fold changes between quercetin-treated and untreated cells for 1206 proteins. Through a bioinformatics functional analysis on a subset of 112 proteins, we propose that the apoptotic phenotype of K562 cells entails a significant modulation of the translational machinery, RNA metabolism, antioxidant defense systems, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Finally, we selected eight differentially expressed proteins, validated their modulated expression in quercetin-treated K562 cells, and discussed their possible role in flavonoid cytotoxicity. This quantitative profiling, performed for the first time on this type of tumor cells upon treatment with a flavonoid, will contribute to revealing the molecular basis of the multiplicity of the effects selectively exerted by quercetin on K562 cells.",,"['Brisdelli, Fabrizia', 'Di Francesco, Laura', 'Giorgi, Alessandra', 'Lizzi, Anna Rita', 'Luzi, Carla', 'Mignogna, Giuseppina', 'Bozzi, Argante', 'Schinina, M Eugenia']","['Brisdelli F', 'Di Francesco L', 'Giorgi A', 'Lizzi AR', 'Luzi C', 'Mignogna G', 'Bozzi A', 'Schinina ME']",,"[""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Sapienza, University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Sapienza, University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Sapienza, University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Sapienza, University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['RM1181641E9150B3/Sapienza, University of Rome; Ateneo 2018']",['Journal Article'],20191219,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Proteome)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Proteome/*drug effects', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",PMC6981597,,['NOTNLM'],"['K562', 'SILAC', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'flavonoids', 'lipid metabolism', 'oxidative stress', 'quantitative proteomics', 'quercetin']",2019/12/22 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/12/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21010032 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21010032 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 19;21(1). pii: ijms21010032. doi: 10.3390/ijms21010032.,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During malignant diseases progression, changes in both DNA methylation patterns and DNA methyltransferase (MTase) genes are observed. Human de novo MTase DNMT3A is most frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a striking prevalence of R882H mutation, which has been extensively studied. Here, we investigate the functional role of the missense mutations (S714C, R635W, R736H, R771L, P777R, and F752V) found in the catalytic domain of DNMT3A in AML patients. These were accordingly mutated in the murine Dnmt3a catalytic domain (S124C, R45W, R146H, R181L, P187R, and F162V) and in addition, one-site CpG-containing DNA substrates were used as a model system. The 3-15-fold decrease (S124C and P187R) or complete loss (F162V, R45W, and R146H) of Dnmt3a-CD methylation activity was observed. Remarkably, Pro 187 and Arg 146 are not located at or near the Dnmt3a functional motives. Regulatory protein Dnmt3L did not enhance the methylation activity of R45W, R146H, P187R, and F162V mutants. The key steps of the Dnmt3a-mediated methylation mechanism, including DNA binding and transient covalent intermediate formation, were examined. There was a complete loss of DNA-binding affinity for R45W located in the AdoMet binding region and for R146H.

A plethora of factors are released in a time-specific fashion to synchronize the differentiation program of both the embryo and the endometrium. Indeed, blastocyst implantation in the uterus occurs in a limited time frame called the ""window of implantation"" (WOI), during which the maternal endometrium undergoes dramatic changes, collectively called ""decidualization"". Decidualization is guided not just by maternal factors (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone), but also by molecules secreted by the embryo, such as chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), just to cite few. Once reached the uterine cavity, the embryo orients correctly toward the uterine epithelium, interacts with specialized structures, called pinopodes, and begins the process of adhesion and invasion. All these events are guided by factors secreted by both the endometrium and the embryo, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), integrins and their ligands, adhesion molecules, Notch family members, and metalloproteinases and their inhibitors. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the factors and mechanisms regulating implantation, with a focus on those involved in the complex crosstalk between the blastocyst and the endometrium.",,"['Massimiani, Micol', 'Lacconi, Valentina', 'La Civita, Fabio', 'Ticconi, Carlo', 'Rago, Rocco', 'Campagnolo, Luisa']","['Massimiani M', 'Lacconi V', 'La Civita F', 'Ticconi C', 'Rago R', 'Campagnolo L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6165-7055', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1923-2744', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7898-2962', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3928-0276']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', ""Saint Camillus International University of Health Sciences, Via di Sant'Alessandro, 8, 00131 Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Section of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier, 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Physiopathology of Reproduction and Andrology Unit, Sandro Pertini Hospital, Via dei Monti Tiburtini 385/389, 00157 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Grant for Fertility Innovation 2017/Merck KGaA'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191218,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hormones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Blastocyst/immunology/*metabolism', '*Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endometrium/immunology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hormones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",PMC6981505,,['NOTNLM'],"['Notch', 'blastocyst', 'chorionic gonadotropin', 'cytokines', 'embryo', 'endometrium', 'implantation', 'progesterone']",2019/12/22 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/12/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21010023 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21010023 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 18;21(1). pii: ijms21010023. doi: 10.3390/ijms21010023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adipose tissue is an alternative source of MSCs, named adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). Because the biology of ASCs in rheumatic diseases (RD) is poorly understood, we performed a basic characterization of RD/ASCs. The phenotype and expression of adhesion molecules (intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1) on commercially available healthy donors (HD), ASC lines (n = 5) and on ASCs isolated from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 16), systemic sclerosis (SSc, n = 17) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n = 16) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The secretion of immunomodulatory factors by untreated and cytokine-treated ASCs was measured by ELISA. RD/ASCs have reduced basal levels of CD90 and ICAM-1 expression, correlated with interleukin (IL)-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 release, respectively. Compared with HD/ASCs, untreated and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) + interferon (IFN)-gamma (TI)-treated RD/ASCs produced similar amounts of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF), and TGF-beta1, more IL-1Ra, soluble human leukocyte antigen G (sHLA-G) and tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene (TSG)-6, but less kynurenines and galectin-3. Basal secretion of galectin-3 was inversely correlated with the patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) value. IFN-alpha and IL-23 slightly raised galectin-3 release from SLE/ASCs and AS/ASCs, respectively. TGF-beta1 up-regulated PGE2 secretion by SSc/ASCs. In conclusion, RD/ASCs are characterized by low basal levels of CD90 and ICAM-1 expression, upregulated secretion of IL-1Ra, TSG-6 and sHLA-G, but impaired release of kynurenines and galectin-3.

Both proteins have been shown to promote the resistance of CML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib mesylate (IM).

In this study, the effects of 17f were evaluated on CML and AML cell lines that respectively acquired resistance to IM and cytarabine (Ara-C), a conventional therapeutic agent used in AML treatment. We showed that 17f strongly inhibits the growth and survival of resistant CML and AML cells when associated with IM or Ara-C.

Whilst decreased HOXA expression acts as a readout for candidate experimental therapies, the necessity of the HOXA cluster for leukemia maintenance has not been fully explored. Primary leukemias were generated in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from Cre responsive transgenic mice for conditional deletion of the Hoxa locus. Hoxa deletion resulted in reduced proliferation and colony formation in which surviving leukemic cells retained at least one copy of the Hoxa cluster, indicating dependency. Comparative transcriptome analysis of Hoxa wild type and deleted leukemic cells identified a unique gene signature associated with key pathways including transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer, the Fanconi anemia pathway and cell cycle progression. Further bioinformatics analysis of the gene signature identified a number of candidate FDA-approved drugs for potential repurposing in high HOXA expressing cancers including MLLr leukemias.

This case history report discusses an 8-year follow-up of implant treatment administered during the remission phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia maintained using nilotinib. A 56-year-old male patient who was undergoing treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia at the Department of Hematology requested a dental consultation for the treatment of a mastication disorder due to loss of mandibular left molars. After confirming via oral and radiographic examination that there were no abnormalities such as periodontal disease, temporomandibular joint symptoms, or metal allergy, two Branemark System Mk III implants with diameters of 3.75 and 5 mm and lengths of 10 and 8.5 mm, respectively, were embedded in the defect. Following this, no problems were observed in the general condition, esthetics, or oral function around the implant. Further, symptoms such as mobility of the implant body or inflammation of the surrounding tissue have not appeared to this day, as the molecular-targeted drug decreases the occurrence of immunosuppression, which could not be achieved conventionally.

AML measurable residual disease (MRD) status before alloHCT has been shown to be prognostic. Whether modulation of the intensity of the alloHCT conditioning regimen in patients with AML who test positive for MRD can prevent relapse and improve survival is unknown. METHODS: Ultra-deep, error-corrected sequencing for 13 commonly mutated genes in AML was performed on preconditioning blood from patients treated in a phase III clinical trial that randomly assigned adult patients with myeloid malignancy in morphologic complete remission to myeloablative conditioning (MAC) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). RESULTS: No mutations were detected in 32% of MAC and 37% of RIC recipients; these groups had similar survival (3-year overall survival [OS], 56% v 63%; P = .96). In patients with a detectable mutation (next-generation sequencing [NGS] positive), relapse (3-year cumulative incidence, 19% v 67%; P < .001) and survival (3-year OS, 61% v 43%; P = .02) was significantly different between the MAC and RIC arms, respectively. In multivariable analysis for NGS-positive patients, adjusting for disease risk and donor group, RIC was significantly associated with increased relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 6.38; 95% CI, 3.37 to 12.10; P < .001), decreased relapse-free survival (HR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.84 to 4.69; P < .001), and decreased OS (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.30; P = .01) compared with MAC. Models of AML MRD also showed benefit for MAC over RIC for those who tested positive. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that MAC rather than RIC in patients with AML with genomic evidence of MRD before alloHCT can result in improved survival.",,"['Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Dillon, Laura W', 'Gui, Gege', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Fei, Mingwei', 'Ghannam, Jack', 'Li, Yuesheng', 'Licon, Abel', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Howard, Alan', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Porter, David L', 'Scott, Bart L', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Pasquini, Marcelo C', 'Horwitz, Mitchell E']","['Hourigan CS', 'Dillon LW', 'Gui G', 'Logan BR', 'Fei M', 'Ghannam J', 'Li Y', 'Licon A', 'Alyea EP', 'Bashey A', 'Deeg HJ', 'Devine SM', 'Fernandez HF', 'Giralt S', 'Hamadani M', 'Howard A', 'Maziarz RT', 'Porter DL', 'Scott BL', 'Warlick ED', 'Pasquini MC', 'Horwitz ME']",,"['National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'ArcherDX, Boulder, CO.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Northside Hospital, Atlanta, GA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, WV.', 'National Marrow Donor Program and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Duke University, Durham, NC.']",['eng'],"['U10 HL069274/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 HL138658/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069246/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL138660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20191220,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Circulating Tumor DNA)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Circulating Tumor DNA/blood/genetics', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC7164487,,,,2019/12/21 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2019/12/21 06:00'],"['2019/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.03011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Apr 20;38(12):1273-1283. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.03011.

Novel therapies specifically targeting AML are of high interest. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate that is specific for human CD30. In this phase 1 dose escalation study, the authors evaluated the safety of BV combined with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) re-induction chemotherapy for patients with CD30-expressing R/R AML. METHODS: Using a standard dose escalation design, the authors evaluated 3 dose levels of BV (0.9 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, and 1.8 mg/kg) administered once on day 1 followed by MEC on days 3 through 7. RESULTS: There were no dose-limiting toxicities noted and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The recommended phase 2 dose of BV was determined to be 1.8 mg/kg when combined with MEC. The side effect profile was similar to that expected from MEC chemotherapy alone, with the most common grade >/=3 toxicities being febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia (toxicities were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). Among the 22 patients enrolled on the trial, the composite response rate was 36%, with a composite response rate of 42% noted among those who received the highest dose of BV. The median overall survival was 9.5 months, with a median disease-free survival of 6.8 months observed among responders. Approximately 55% of patients were able to proceed with either allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or donor lymphocyte infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of BV with MEC was found to be safe in patients with CD30-expressing R/R AML and warrants further study comparing this combination with the use of MEC alone in this population (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01830777). LAY SUMMARY: The outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) are exceptionally poor. New and emerging treatment combinations are actively being studied in an effort to improve outcomes. The authors examined the combination of brentuximab vedotin, an antibody product that recognizes a marker called CD30, with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC), a common chemotherapy regimen, in patients with R/R AML that expressed the CD30 marker. The authors found that the combination was safe and well tolerated. Future studies comparing this new combination with the use of MEC alone can help to inform its effectiveness for this patient population.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Narayan, Rupa',

The authors investigated whether disease characteristics before the receipt of ruxolitinib may predict drug discontinuation in patients with myelofibrosis and whether reasons for drug discontinuation, disease phase at discontinuation, and salvage therapies may influence the outcome. METHODS: A centralized electronic clinical database was created in 20 European hematology centers, including clinical and laboratory data for 524 patients who received ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis. RESULTS: At 3 years, 40.8% of patients had stopped ruxolitinib. Baseline predictors of drug discontinuation were: intermediate-2-risk/high-risk category (Dynamic International Prognostic Score System), a platelet count <100 x10(9) per liter, transfusion dependency, and unfavorable karyotype. At last contact, 268 patients (51.1%) had discontinued therapy, and the median drug exposure was 17.5 months. Fifty patients (18.7%) died while taking ruxolitinib. The reasons for discontinuation in the remaining 218 patients were the lack (22.9%) or loss (11.9%) of a spleen response, ruxolitinib-related adverse events (27.5%), progression to blast phase (23.4%), ruxolitinib-unrelated adverse events (9.2%), and allogeneic transplantation during response (5.1%). The median survival after ruxolitinib was 13.2 months and was significantly better in the 167 patients who discontinued ruxolitinib in chronic phase (27.5 vs 3.9 months for those who discontinued in blast phase; P < .001). No survival differences were observed among patients who discontinued ruxolitinib in chronic phase because of lack of response, loss of response, or ruxolitinib-related adverse events. The use of investigational agents and/or ruxolitinib rechallenge were associated with improved outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The survival of patients with myelofibrosis after discontinuation of ruxolitinib is poor, particularly for those who discontinue in blast phase.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is among these factors; it plays an essential role in proliferation of leukemic cells. METHODS: We obtained the materials used in our study via PubMed search from 1996 through 2019. The key search terms included ""STAT5,"" ""acute leukemia,"" ""leukemogenesis,"" and ""mutation."" RESULTS: On activation, STAT5 not only inhibits apoptosis of leukemic cells via activating the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) gene but also inhibits resistance to chemotherapy by enhancing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and maintaining telomere length in cells. It has also been shown that a number of mutations in the STAT5 gene and in related genes alter the expression of STAT5. CONCLUSION: The identification of STAT5 and the factors activated in its up- or downstream expression, affecting its function, contribute to better treatments such as targeted therapy rather than chemotherapy, improving the quality of life patients.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2019.

Contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) with Enterococcus can result in transfusion-transmitted infection. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the investigation of a septic transfusion case involving a 27-year-old male patient with relapsed acute leukemia who was transfused with a 5-day-old buffy coat PC pool and developed fever and rigors. DISCUSSION: Microbiology testing and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was done on patient blood cultures obtained from peripheral and central lines. Microbiology and molecular testing were also performed on the remaining posttransfusion PC pool, which was refrigerated for 24 hours before microbiology testing. Red blood cell (RBC) and plasma units associated with the implicated PCs were screened for microbial contamination. Patient blood cultures obtained from peripheral and central lines yielded vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Gram stain of a sample from the platelet pool was negative but coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNST) and VRE were isolated on culture. Antibiotic sensitivity and PFGE profiles of several VRE isolates from the patient before and after transfusion, and the PC pool, revealed that all were closely related. Associated RBC and plasma components tested negative for microbial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological and molecular investigations showed a relationship between VRE isolated from the patient before and after transfusion, and therefore it is postulated that a patient-to-PC retrograde contamination (from either blood or skin) occurred. As the CNST isolated from the PC pool was not isolated from patient samples, its implication in the transfusion event is unknown.",['(c) 2019 AABB.'],"['Drews, Steven J', 'Lesley, Peter', 'Detsky, Michael E', 'Distefano, Lanis', 'Ilagan, Cesario', 'Mehta, Sangeeta', 'McGeer, Allison', 'Shehata, Nadine', 'Skeate, Robert', 'Ramirez-Arcos, Sandra']","['Drews SJ', 'Lesley P', 'Detsky ME', 'Distefano L', 'Ilagan C', 'Mehta S', 'McGeer A', 'Shehata N', 'Skeate R', 'Ramirez-Arcos S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2519-1109', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0705-4987']","['Canadian Blood Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Canadian Blood Services, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Canadian Blood Services, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Canadian Blood Services, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Canadian Blood Services, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Canadian Blood Services, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Canadian Blood Services/International', 'Health Canada/International']","['Case Reports', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191220,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Enterococcus faecium/drug effects/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Transfusion Reaction/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/drug effects/*pathogenicity']",,,,,2019/12/21 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2019/12/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15644 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2020 Feb;60(2):430-435. doi: 10.1111/trf.15644.

This paper summarized the advance of Paeoniflorin on cancers in vivo and in vitro, discussed the related molecular mechanisms, as well as suggested some perspectives of the future investigations. KEY FINDINGS: Anticancer activities of paeoniflorin have been comprehensively investigated, including liver cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, glioma, bladder cancer and leukaemia. Furthermore, the potential molecular mechanisms corresponding to the antitumour effects of Paeoniflorin might be related to the following aspects: inhibition of tumour cell proliferation and neovascularization, induction apoptosis, and inhibition of tumour invasion and metastasis. SUMMARY: Paeoniflorin has wide spectrum antitumour activities; however, in vivo and clinical investigations on antitumour effect of Paeoniflorin are lacking which should be focused on further studies. Our present review on antitumour effects of Paeoniflorin would be beneficial for the further molecular mechanisms study, candidate antitumour drug development and clinical research of Paeoniflorin in the future.",['(c) 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.'],"['Xiang, Yongjing', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Wei, Shujun', 'Huang, Cong', 'Li, Zhengsheng', 'Gao, Yongxiang']","['Xiang Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Wei S', 'Huang C', 'Li Z', 'Gao Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6921-9006'],"['Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.', 'Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.', 'Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.', 'Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.', 'Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China.', 'Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['2018ZX09721004-009-002/National Science and Technology Major Project of the', 'Ministry of Science and Technology of China', '2019JDRC0074/Sichuan Science and Technology Program']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191219,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '21AIQ4EV64 (peoniflorin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Glioma', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Monoterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Paeoniflorin', 'antitumour', 'molecular mechanism', 'natural agents', 'signalling pathway']",2019/12/21 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2019/12/21 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.13204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2020 Apr;72(4):483-495. doi: 10.1111/jphp.13204.

Cancer survival rates have significantly improved, highlighting the importance of survivorship programs that address late complications related to cancer itself or its treatment. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of fertility counseling and sperm banking and related factors among at-risk males newly diagnosed with cancer and planning to receive a potentially curative anticancer therapy. METHODS: Medical records and hospital database of young male patients with newly diagnosed cancers and planned to start chemotherapy were reviewed for fertility counseling and sperm cryopreservation. Additionally, a self-administered questionnaire was utilized. RESULTS: A total of 186 patients, mean age 32.9 (range: 18-53) years, were included. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 59 (31.7%), leukemia 48 (25.8%), and Hodgkin's lymphoma 26 (14.0%) were the most common tumors encountered. A total of 129 (75.0%) respondents received fertility counseling prior to their treatment, and this rate was higher among patients with early-stage disease (82.4% vs. 58.1%, p = 0.038). However, sperm banking was performed by 33.1% of the whole study group but was significantly higher among single patients (53.4% vs. 17.7%, p < 0.001), those who had no children (51.8% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001), and among highly educated patients (47.6% vs. 17.1%, p = 0.001). Patients failed to do sperm banking because they were not informed about the risk of infertility (26.2%) or service availability (25.4%). Fear of treatment delay was a reason in 20.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Fertility counseling and sperm banking among cancer patients are not optimal. Many patients failed to do sperm banking because of avoidable reasons. Better communication and patients' education will probably improve the utilization of this vital service.",,"['Abdel-Razeq, Nayef', 'Ammar, Khawlah', 'Mahadeen, Ahmad', 'Mansour, Razan', 'Abdalwahed, Hashem', 'Gammoh, Ronza', 'Al Hur, Anas', 'Al-Hassan, Nadira', 'Abdel-Razeq, Hikmat']","['Abdel-Razeq N', 'Ammar K', 'Mahadeen A', 'Mansour R', 'Abdalwahed H', 'Gammoh R', 'Al Hur A', 'Al-Hassan N', 'Abdel-Razeq H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2833-6051'],"['Department of Internal Medicine.

Whole chromosome gains and losses, subchromosomal copy number aberrations, as well as unbalanced alterations conferring intrachromosomal gene fusions were simultaneously identified with results available within 36 hours. Aberrations were observed in 96% of diagnostic patient samples, and increased numbers of copy number aberrations were detected at the time of relapse as compared with diagnosis. Comparative scrutiny of 24 matching diagnostic and relapse samples from 11 patients revealed three different patterns of clonal relationships with (i) one patient displaying identical copy number aberration profiles at diagnosis and relapse, (ii) six patients showing clonal evolution with all lesions detected at diagnosis being present at relapse, and (iii) four patients displaying conserved as well as lost or gained copy number aberrations at the time of relapse, suggestive of the presence of a common ancestral cell compartment giving rise to clinically manifest leukemia at different time points during the disease course. A newly introduced risk classifier combining cytogenetic data with digitalMLPA(TM)-based copy number aberration profiles allowed for the determination of four genetic subgroups of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with distinct event-free survival rates. DigitalMLPA(TM) provides fast, robust, and highly optimized copy number aberration profiling for the genomic characterization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples, facilitates the decipherment of the clonal origin of relapse and provides highly relevant information for clinical prognosis assessment.",,"['Kiss, Richard', 'Gango, Ambrus', 'Benard-Slagter, Anne', 'Egyed, Balint', 'Haltrich, Iren', 'Hegyi, Lajos', 'de Groot, Karel', 'Kiraly, Peter Attila', 'Krizsan, Szilvia', 'Kajtar, Bela', 'Piko, Henriett', 'Pajor, Laszlo', 'Vojcek, Agnes', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Szuhai, Karoly', 'Savola, Suvi', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Alpar, Donat']","['Kiss R', 'Gango A', 'Benard-Slagter A', 'Egyed B', 'Haltrich I', 'Hegyi L', 'de Groot K', 'Kiraly PA', 'Krizsan S', 'Kajtar B', 'Piko H', 'Pajor L', 'Vojcek A', 'Matolcsy A', 'Kovacs G', 'Szuhai K', 'Savola S', 'Bodor C', 'Alpar D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4554-9796', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1782-9275', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1228-4245', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6221-8617', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2638-5418']","['MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pecs Clinical Centre, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Diagnostics, National Center of Public Health, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pecs Clinical Centre, Pecs, Hungary.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Pecs Clinical Centre, Pecs, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. alpar.donat@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191219,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics']",,,,,2019/12/21 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2019/12/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-019-0423-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-019-0423-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2020 May;33(5):812-824. doi: 10.1038/s41379-019-0423-5.

Growing evidence indicates that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix plays a major role in chemoresistance. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We have previously shown that the collagen-binding integrin alpha2beta1 promoted doxorubicin resistance in acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this study, we found that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines also express alpha2beta1 integrin and collagen promoted their chemoresistance as well. Furthermore, we found that high levels of alpha2 integrin correlate with worse overall survival in AML. Our results showed that doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells is associated with activation of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) and that collagen inhibited this pathway. The protective effect of collagen is associated with the inhibition of Rac1-induced DNA damage as evaluated by the comet assay and the phosphorylated levels of histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX). Together these results show that by inhibiting pro-apoptotic Rac1, alpha2beta1 integrin can be a major pathway protecting leukemic cells from genotoxic agents and may thus represent an important therapeutic target in anti-cancer treatment.",,"['Naci, Dalila', 'Berrazouane, Sofiane', 'Barabe, Frederic', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Naci D', 'Berrazouane S', 'Barabe F', 'Aoudjit F']",,"['Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires, Quebec, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires, Quebec, Canada.', 'Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires, Quebec, Canada.', 'Departement de Medicine, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires, Quebec, Canada. fawzi.aoudjit@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca.', 'Departement de Microbiologie-infectiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada. fawzi.aoudjit@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca.']",['eng'],"['MOP-98005/Gouvernement du Canada | Canadian Institutes of Health Research', '(Instituts de Recherche en Sante du Canada)/International', 'MOP-136819/Gouvernement du Canada | Canadian Institutes of Health Research', '(Instituts de Recherche en Sante du Canada)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191219,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Integrin alpha2beta1)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2beta1/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",PMC6923425,,,,2019/12/21 06:00,2020/11/12 06:00,['2019/12/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-55934-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-55934-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Dec 19;9(1):19455. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-55934-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main adverse effect of CAR T-cell therapy is potentially life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Clinical cardiovascular (CV) manifestations of CRS include tachycardia, hypotension, troponin elevation, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. Although insults related to CRS toxicity might be transient and reversible in most instances in patients with adequate CV reserve, they can be particularly challenging in higher-risk, often elderly patients with pre-existing CV disease. As the use of CAR T-cell therapy expands to include a wider patient population, careful patient selection, pre-treatment cardiac evaluation, and CV risk stratification should be considered within the CAR T-cell treatment protocol.

IL-15, either in its soluble form (IL-15sol) or complexed with IL-15Ralpha (IL-15Rc), has been shown to exhibit potent anti-tumor activities in various experimental cancer studies. Here we describe the impact of intraperitoneal IL-15 in a cancer cell-delivered IL-15 immunotherapy approach using the 70Z/3-L leukemia mouse model. Whereas both forms of IL-15 led to significantly improved survival rates compared to the parent cell line, there were striking differences in the extent of the improved survival: mice receiving cancer cells secreting IL-15sol showed significantly longer survival and protective long-term immunity compared to those producing IL-15Rc. Interestingly, injection of leukemia cells secreting IL-15sol lead to heightened expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell populations in the peritoneum compared to IL-15Rc.

Meanwhile, significant reduction in Treg activity along with production of proinflammatory cytokines has been reported in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). METHODS: In this study, to examine whether there is an alteration in EOS expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from HTLV-1-infected individuals especially HAM/TSP, we investigated the expression of HTLV-1 tax genotype, proviral load (PVL), and the mRNA expression of tax, HBZ and EOS in HTLV-1 infected individuals including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HAM/TSP, or asymptomatic carriers. The expression levels of EOS mRNA and protein in various HTLV-1-infected or uninfected human T-cell lines were also investigated. RESULTS: EOS was highly expressed at the protein level in most HTLV-1 infected T-cell lines, and was augmented after the HTLV-1 regulatory factor Tax was induced in a Tax-inducible JPX-9 cell line. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between EOS and the viral regulatory protein Tax, but not HBZ. Meanwhile, there was a significant decrease in EOS mRNA levels in PBMCs of HTLV-1 infected individuals irrespective of their clinical statuses. We found an inverse correlation between EOS mRNA levels and HTLV-1 PVL in ATL patients, and positive correlations between both EOS mRNA load and PVL, and EOS and HBZ mRNA load in HAM/TSP patients, whereas this correlation was not observed in other clinical statuses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both Tax and HBZ can alter the expression of EOS through undetermined mechanisms, and dysregulated expression of EOS in PBMCs of HTLV-1 infected individuals may contribute to the pathological progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases, such as ATL and HAM/TSP.",,"['Naito, Tadasuke', 'Ushirogawa, Hiroshi', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Saito, Mineki']","['Naito T', 'Ushirogawa H', 'Fukushima T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Saito M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8208-5586'],"['Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmnology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan. mineki@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191219,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (IKZF4 protein, human)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/metabolism']",PMC6923961,,['NOTNLM'],"['*EOS (Ikzf4)', '*HAM/TSP', '*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*Tax']",2019/12/21 06:00,2020/04/29 06:00,['2019/12/21 06:00'],"['2019/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-019-1270-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-019-1270-1 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2019 Dec 19;16(1):160. doi: 10.1186/s12985-019-1270-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FeLV is found in some tissues, such as spleen, lymph nodes and epithelial tissues. However, there is controversy about the organ in which the virus can be reliably detected in infected cats. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of viral infection in hemolymphatic tissues, including blood, bone marrow and spleen by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 31 cats with clinical signs of FeLV infection associated with at least a single lineage hematologic cytopenia were included in this study. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen samples were obtained from each cat. Complete blood counts, biochemical tests, and a rapid test to detect FeLV p27 antigen in blood samples of cats were performed. Of 31 cats, 9 had anemia alone, 4 had thrombocytopenia alone, 2 had neutropenia alone, 9 had bicytopenia of anemia and thrombocytopenia, 3 had bicytopenia of anemia and neutropenia, and 4 had pancytopenia. FeLV RNA was then detected by RT-qPCR in the whole blood, bone marrow and spleen. Viral RNA copy numbers were detected in all cats by RT-qPCR whereas 24 out of 31 cats were positive for the serum FeLV antigen. We detected a significantly greater number of viral RNA in the spleen compared with the whole blood and bone marrow.

Methods: The clinical data of 7 patients suffering from mucormycosis during September 2012 and September 2018 were retrospectively analyzed, and their clinical characteristics, treatment process and prognosis were analyzed. Results: Of 7 patients, there were 4 males and 3 females, with a median age of 36 (19-79) years old. Two patients were diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia as the underlying disease, the other 5 patients suffered from acute B lymphoblastic leukemia, peripheral T cell lymphoma, chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic phase, myeloproliferative neoplasm and severe aplastic anemia after transplantation, respectively. Among them, disease types of mucormycosis were pulmonary in 4 patients, rhino-orbital-cerebral in 1 patient, cutaneous in 1 patient and disseminated in 1 patient. All the cases were confirmed by biopsy histopathology. The treatment drugs were amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B, and posaconazole.

Methods: Frontline group: Data of adults with newly diagnosed CML-CP receiving Chinese generic imatinib (Xinwei((R))) or branded imatinib (Glivec((R))) between October 2013 and August 2018 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Switching group: Data of adults diagnosed with CML-CP who received branded imatinib and then switched to Chinese generic imatinib after achieving at least complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Frontline group: In total, 409 adult patients receiving Chinese generic imatinib (n=201) or Glivec (n=208) were included in this study. Median age was 42 years (range, 18-83 years) . Comparison of baseline showed significant difference on demographic characteristics among two cohorts: lower education level (P<0.001) , and divorced or widowed status (P=0.004) and rural household registration (P<0.001) were more common in the generic imatinib cohort than those in the Glivec cohort. There was no significant difference on age, gender, Sokal risk score, WBC and HGB between the 2 cohorts. With a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 3-62 months) , there was no significant difference on the 3-year cumulative incidence of achieving CCyR (97.5% vs 94.5%, P=0.592) , major molecular response (MMR) (84.3% vs 93.1%, P=0.208) , molecular response(4.0) (MR(4.0)) (42.7% vs 41.7%, P=0.277) , molecular response(4.5) (MR(4.5)) (25.4% vs 33.0%, P=0.306) as well as the 3-year probabilities of failure free survival (FFS) (76.7% vs 81.0%, P=0.448) , progression free survival (PFS) (91.8% vs 96.3%, P=0.325) and overall survival (OS) (95.8% vs 98.5%, P=0.167) between the generic and branded imatinib cohorts. Multivariate analysis showed the type of imatinib was not associated with treatment responses and outcomes. The incidences of adverse effects were comparable in the 2 cohorts. Switching group: In total, 39 patients switching from branded imatinib to Chinese generic imatinib after achieving at least CCyR were included in this study. Median age was 42 years (range, 23-80 years) . With a median follow-up of 39 months (range, 6-63 months) , molecular responses were maintained in 23 (58.9%) patients and improved in 12 (39.8%) patients. Adverse effects were tolerable. Conclusion: Demographic characteristics might influence the choice of the type of TKI used in CML-CP patients. There was a comparable efficacy and safety between the Chinese generic imatinib and the branded imatinib in adults with newly diagnosed CML-CP under standard management and closely monitoring. Patients could safely switch from the branded imatinib to the Chinese generic imatinib.",,"['Dou, X L', 'Yu, L', 'Qin, Y Z', 'Shi, H X', 'Lai, Y Y', 'Hou, Y', 'Huang, X J', 'Jiang, Q']","['Dou XL', 'Yu L', 'Qin YZ', 'Shi HX', 'Lai YY', 'Hou Y', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang Q']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['81770161/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Demography', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7342368,,['NOTNLM'],"['Imatinib', 'Leukemia, myeloid, chronic', 'Treatment outcome']",2019/12/20 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.11.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Nov 14;40(11):924-931. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.11.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD4+ iTregs can effectively prevent GVHD but impair the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, whereas CD8+ iTregs preserve the GVL effect but have limited efficacy in GVHD control because of their instability under inflammatory conditions. Thus, we aimed to stabilize CD8+ iTregs via treatment with vitamin C (Vit C) to improve their efficacy in controlling GVHD. We found that addition of Vit C significantly improved the stability of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression in CD8+ iTregs. Moreover, Vit C-treated CD8+ iTregs exhibited high efficacy in attenuating acute and chronic GVHD. The mechanistic study revealed that addition of Vit C to CD8+ iTreg culture markedly increased DNA demethylation in the conserved noncoding sequence 2 region and, hence, maintained higher Foxp3 expression levels compared with untreated controls. In acute GVHD, Vit C-treated CD8+ iTregs were able to inhibit pathogenic T-cell expansion and differentiation while reducing thymus damage and B-cell activation in cGVHD. Importantly, in contrast to CD4+ iTregs, Vit C-treated CD8+ iTregs retained the ability to control tumor relapse.

In multiple myeloma (MM), MCL-1 expression contributes to survival of malignant plasma cells, and overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated whether sensitivity to the novel MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 could be predicted using cytogenetics, focusing on amplification of 1q21, the chromosomal region that contains the MCL1 locus. In addition, we studied the relation of MCL-1 inhibitor sensitivity with other diagnostic characteristics and BCL-2 family protein expression. In 31 human myeloma cell lines and in bone marrow aspirates from 47 newly diagnosed MM patients, we measured the effect of S63845 alone, or combined with BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax), and BCL-XL inhibitor A-1155463 or A-1331852 on cell viability. We demonstrated for the first time that MM cells from patients with 1q21 amplification are significantly more sensitive to inhibition of MCL-1. We suggest that this increased sensitivity results from high relative MCL1 expression resulting from amplification of 1q21. Additionally, and partially independent from 1q21 status, high serum beta2 microglobulin level and presence of renal insufficiency correlated with increased sensitivity to MCL-1 inhibitor treatment. Combining S63845 with other BH3 mimetics synergistically enhanced apoptosis compared with single inhibitors, and sensitivity to inhibitor combinations was found in a large proportion of MM insensitive to MCL-1 inhibition alone.

We conducted preclinical testing of atovaquone with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and pediatric patient samples. Atovaquone induced apoptosis with an EC50 <30 microM for most AML lines and primary pediatric AML specimens. In NSG mice xenografted with luciferase-expressing THP-1 cells and in those receiving a patient-derived xenograft, atovaquone-treated mice demonstrated decreased disease burden and prolonged survival. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of atovaquone, we performed an integrated analysis of gene expression changes occurring in cancer cell lines after atovaquone exposure. Atovaquone promoted phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, a key component of the integrated stress response and master regulator of protein translation. Increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha led to greater abundance of the transcription factor ATF4 and its target genes, including proapoptotic CHOP and CHAC1. Furthermore, atovaquone upregulated REDD1, an ATF4 target gene and negative regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and caused REDD1-mediated inhibition of mTOR activity with similar efficacy as rapamycin. Additionally, atovaquone suppressed the oxygen consumption rate of AML cells, which has specific implications for chemotherapy-resistant AML blasts that rely on oxidative phosphorylation for survival. Our results provide insight into the complex biological effects of atovaquone, highlighting its potential as an anticancer therapy with novel and diverse mechanisms of action, and support further clinical evaluation of atovaquone for pediatric and adult AML.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Stevens, Alexandra M', 'Xiang, Michael', 'Heppler, Lisa N', 'Tosic, Isidora', 'Jiang, Kevin', 'Munoz, Jaime O', 'Gaikwad, Amos S', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Long, Xin', 'Narayanan, Padmini', 'Seashore, Elizabeth L', 'Terrell, Maci C', 'Rashid, Raushan', 'Krueger, Michael J', 'Mangubat-Medina, Alicia E', 'Ball, Zachary T', 'Sumazin, Pavel', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Hamada, Yoshimasa', 'Oyadomari, Seiichi', 'Redell, Michele S', 'Frank, David A']","['Stevens AM', 'Xiang M', 'Heppler LN', 'Tosic I', 'Jiang K', 'Munoz JO', 'Gaikwad AS', 'Horton TM', 'Long X', 'Narayanan P', 'Seashore EL', 'Terrell MC', 'Rashid R', 'Krueger MJ', 'Mangubat-Medina AE', 'Ball ZT', 'Sumazin P', 'Walker SR', 'Hamada Y', 'Oyadomari S', 'Redell MS', 'Frank DA']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;

Yet, it is still unclear if the sperm produced many years after remission of cancer display DNA and chromatin damage linked to male infertility and poor embryo development. As well, the importance of the age at diagnosis in relation to puberty is poorly understood. In this pilot study, we compared reproductive parameters and sperm damage from adult survivors of childhood leukemia and lymphoma, sub-divided into those diagnosed before or after puberty, to men with no history of cancer. Our data indicate that CCS, independently of the age of diagnosis, have a high risk of low sperm count and when sperm are present, chances of DNA and chromatin abnormalities appear similar to those seen in the general population. Exposure to alkylating agents is correlated with low sperm count whereas exposure to anthracyclines, and doxorubicin in particular, could have long-term consequences on sperm integrity.

However, little has been known about the effects of ATPR on MDS. To analyze if and to what extent it's anti-tumor activity on MDS, we performed CCK-8, Flow Cytometry, Wright-Giemsa staining, qRT-PCR, and Western blot to analyze the SKM-1 cells state after ATPR treatment in multiplex detection angles. As expected, our results proved that ATPR could effectively induce cell differentiation and reduce cell proliferation of SKM-1 cell lines. Subsequently, to further analyze the potential mechanisms, we applied Label-free proteomic techniques to discover relevant protein that may be involved. Most notably, a series of factors related to RNA behavioral regulation were changed. Among them, we demonstrated that DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX23 was abnormally ablated in MDS patients and could be restored after ATPR treatment in vitro. Besides, our results suggested that ATPR-induced SKM-1 cell maturation was counteracted when knockdown DDX23, underscoring that DDX23 might be involved. In conclusion, we confirmed that ATPR could induce SKM-1 cells differentiation and its positive influence of DDX23 may provide a new idea to relieve MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

As a step toward clinical translation of menin-MLL1 inhibitors, we report development of MI-3454, a highly potent and orally bioavailable inhibitor of the menin-MLL1 interaction. MI-3454 profoundly inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation in acute leukemia cells and primary patient samples with MLL1 translocations or NPM1 mutations. When applied as a single agent, MI-3454 induced complete remission or regression of leukemia in mouse models of MLL1-rearranged or NPM1-mutated leukemia, including patient-derived xenograft models, through downregulation of key genes involved in leukemogenesis. We also identified MEIS1 as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker of treatment response with MI-3454 in leukemia, and demonstrated that this compound is well tolerated and did not impair normal hematopoiesis in mice. Overall, this study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, profound activity of the menin-MLL1 inhibitor as a single agent in clinically relevant PDX models of leukemia.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from 196 de novo AML patients prior to initiation of treatment and from 50 subjects underwent bone marrow donation or bone marrow biopsy for non-hematologic malignant disease (as controls). ITGA7 mRNA and protein expressions were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays, respectively. In AML patients, the risk stratification was assessed, and complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Both ITGA7 mRNA and protein expressions were increased in AML patients compared with controls, and their expressions were correlated with poorer risk stratification. For prognosis, ITGA7 mRNA expression and protein expression were declined in CR patients compared to non-CR patients. Meanwhile, both EFS and OS were shorter in ITGA7 mRNA high expression patients compared to ITGA7 mRNA low expression patients, as well as ITGA7 protein high expression patients compared to ITGA7 protein low expression patients. CONCLUSION: Integrin alpha7 might serve as a potential biomarker for predicting increased AML risk and worse prognosis in AML patients.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Toxic effects can be severe and treatment-limiting. Outcomes in a real-world population are not yet characterized. Objective: We compared IDEL treatment outcomes in the clinical setting with outcomes in clinical trial data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study compared clinical trial participants treated with IDEL, aged 65 years or older, in studies 101-09 and 312-0116 with Medicare beneficiaries treated with IDEL of the same disease state and treatment regimen. Study 101-09 was a phase 2, single-group, open-label trial supporting accelerated approval of IDEL for relapsed or refractory FL. Study 312-0116 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial supporting approval of IDEL+R for relapsed CLL. Analyses were conducted between February and December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Treatment duration, on-treatment and overall mortality, and serious and fatal infections were compared between trial participants and Medicare beneficiaries. Cox proportional hazards models quantified differences by cohort. Results: We identified 26 trial participants (mean [SD] age, 73 [4.9] years; 12 [46.2%] women) and 305 Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 76 [6.9] years; 103 [54.8%] women) receiving IDEL for FL and 89 trial participants (mean [SD] age, 74 [6.0] years; 30 [33.7%] women) and 294 Medicare beneficiaries (mean age, 76 [6.3] years; 111 [37.8%] women) receiving IDEL+R for CLL. Medicare beneficiaries were older with higher comorbidity; had a shorter median treatment duration for CLL (173 days vs 473 days, P < .001) but not FL (114, days vs 160 days, P = .38); a numerically higher mortality rate (CLL: HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93-2.11; FL: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.69-2.78); and a significantly higher fatal infection rate per 100 person-years for CLL (18.4 vs 9.8, P = .04) and a numerically higher rate for FL (27.6 vs 18.6, P = .54), compared with trial participants. Trial participants had approximately twice as many dose reductions (CLL: 32.6% vs 18.0%; P = .003; FL: 38.5% vs 16.1%; P = .02). Among Medicare beneficiaries, a hospitalized infection within 6 months prior to IDEL initiation was associated with a 2.11-fold increased risk for on-treatment fatal infections (95% CI, 1.44-3.10). Despite a March 2016 recommendation for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in patients treated with IDEL, prophylaxis rates were low after March 2016 (FL: 25%, CLL: 37%). Conclusions and Relevance: We observed substantial imbalances in baseline comorbidities and treatment outcomes between Medicare beneficiaries and trial participants aged 65 years or older. Immunosuppression-related toxic effects, including infections, may have been somewhat reduced in trials by more frequent dose reductions and exclusion of patients with ongoing infections. Selective eligibility criteria and closer monitoring of trial patients may be responsible for limited generalizability of trial data to clinical practice.",,"['Bird, Steven T', 'Tian, Fang', 'Flowers, Natasha', 'Przepiorka, Donna', 'Wang, Rongrong', 'Jung, Tae-Hyun', 'Kessler, Zebulin', 'Woods, Corinne', 'Kim, Bo', 'Miller, Barry W', 'Wernecke, Michael', 'Kim, Clara', 'McKean, Stephen', 'Gelperin, Kate', 'MaCurdy, Thomas E', 'Kelman, Jeffrey A', 'Graham, David J']","['Bird ST', 'Tian F', 'Flowers N', 'Przepiorka D', 'Wang R', 'Jung TH', 'Kessler Z', 'Woods C', 'Kim B', 'Miller BW', 'Wernecke M', 'Kim C', 'McKean S', 'Gelperin K', 'MaCurdy TE', 'Kelman JA', 'Graham DJ']",,"['Office of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Office of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, Division of Hematology Products, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Division of Biometrics, Office of Biostatistics, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Office of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, Division of Hematology Products, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Division of Biometrics, Office of Biostatistics, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Office of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Acumen LLC, Burlingame, California.', 'Department of Economics, Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Woodlawn, Maryland.', 'Office of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Comorbidity', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/drug therapy/mortality', '*Insurance Benefits', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', '*Medicare', 'Purines/*administration & dosage', 'Quinazolinones/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",PMC6990831,,,,2019/12/20 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['2757394 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.3994 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2020 Feb 1;6(2):248-254. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.3994.,,,,,['JAMA Oncol. 2020 Feb 1;6(2):302.

This review focuses on a general evaluation of beta-catenin function in normal T-cell development and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The integration of the existing literature offers a state-of-the-art dissection of the complexity of beta-catenin function in leukemia initiation and maintenance in both Notch-dependent and independent contexts. In addition, beta-catenin mutations are screened for in T-ALL primary samples, and it is found that they are rare and with little clinical relevance. Transcriptional analysis of Wnt family members (Ctnnb1, Axin2, Tcf7, and Lef1) and Myc in different publicly available T-ALL cohorts indicates that the expression of these genes may correlate with T-ALL subtypes and/or therapy outcomes.","['(c) 2019 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bigas, Anna', 'Guillen, Yolanda', 'Schoch, Leonie', 'Arambilet, David']","['Bigas A', 'Guillen Y', 'Schoch L', 'Arambilet D']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4801-6899'],"[""Cancer Research Program, CIBERONC, Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM), Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cancer Research Program, CIBERONC, Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM), Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cancer Research Program, CIBERONC, Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM), Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Cancer Research Program, CIBERONC, Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques (IMIM), Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191219,United States,Bioessays,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,['0 (beta Catenin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'beta Catenin/*genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LIC activity', '*Myc', '*Notch pathway', '*T-cell acute leukemia', '*Wnt signaling', '*beta-catenin']",2019/12/20 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bies.201900099 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioessays. 2020 Feb;42(2):e1900099. doi: 10.1002/bies.201900099.

(Zingiberaceae), has been considered as a cancer chemopreventive drug by American National Cancer Institute.Objective: To examine the effect of curcumin on acute monocytic leukaemia SHI-1 cells in vivo.Materials and methods: The SHI-1 cells (1 x 10(6) cells in 0.1 mL PBS) were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of the female SCID mice. Curcumin dissolved in olive oil (15 and 30 mg/kg) was administered (i.p.) to mice once a day for 15 days while the control group received olive oil injection. Tumour proliferation and apoptosis were examined by PCNA, TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 staining. The expression of MAPK, NF-kappaB, MMP9, MMP2 and vimentin were confirmed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry or western blotting.Results: Administration of curcumin significantly inhibited tumour growth, as the tumour weight decreased from 0.67 g (control) to 0.47 g (15 mg/kg) and 0.35 g (30 mg/kg). Curcumin inhibited the expression of PCNA and increased the degree of TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 staining in tumour tissue. The results of western blotting showed that curcumin treatment inhibited NF-kappaB and ERK signalling while activating p38 and JNK. Moreover, curcumin attenuated the mRNA transcription and protein expression of MMP2 and MMP9. Curcumin also suppressed the level of vimentin.Discussion and conclusions: Our study demonstrates that curcumin can inhibit the growth and invasion of human monocytic leukaemia in vivo, suggesting the possible use of curcumin for anti-metastasis in leukaemia and the value of determining its unique target.",,"['Zhu, Guohua', 'Shen, Qun', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Ji, Ou', 'Zhu, Lingling', 'Zhang, Linyang']","['Zhu G', 'Shen Q', 'Jiang H', 'Ji O', 'Zhu L', 'Zhang L']",,"['First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6968541,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'matrix metalloproteinase', 'metastasis', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase']",2019/12/20 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13880209.2019.1701042 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2020 Dec;58(1):25-34. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2019.1701042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present a case report of a breakthrough Trichosporon asahii infection in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and review all of the cases of breakthrough Trichosporon spp. infections published in the literature to date. RESULTS: We extracted 68 cases of breakthrough Trichosporon spp. infections, wherein 95.5% patients had hematological malignancy, 61.8% of them occurred in the presence of echinocandins, 22% of triazoles, 13.2% of amphotericin and 3% of other combinations of antifungals. The most prevalent manifestation was fungemia (94%); 82.8% of these were associated with the presence of a central venous catheter. The overall mortality was 68.7%; the patients who survived recovered from the neutropenic event.

Recent advancements in our patho-biologic understanding of the disease have led to the development of new targeted therapies for BPDCN. In this review, we aimed to describe some of the novel treatments that are being put forward for the management of BPDCN. RECENT FINDINGS: Tagraxofusp is the first CD123-targeted therapy approved as the first ever targeted treatment of BPDCN in patients aged 2 years and older. This agent was approved based on a pivotal clinical trial that showed that it was associated with high rates of clinical responses in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. The most serious adverse event was occurrence of the capillary leak syndrome. Other targeted therapies are actively being investigated in clinical trials. These include other CD123-targeted approaches, as well as active investigation in targets beyond CD123, such as the BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. BPDCN is a rare hematologic clonal disorder with historically poor outcomes. Newer targeted therapies have been recently introduced, with promising results and novel toxicities that are important to recognize and understand. Stem cell transplantation after achievement of complete remission remains the mainstay of therapy among younger/fit, eligible patients, regardless of treatment modality used.",,"['Economides, Minas P', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['Economides MP', 'Rizzieri D', 'Pemmaraju N']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas School of Health Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. npemmaraju@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BPDCN', '*Leukemia', '*Stem cell transplantation', '*Tagraxofusp']",2019/12/20 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00556-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00556-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Dec;14(6):515-522. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00556-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By coupling with mass spectrometry, three goals were simultaneously realized, viz. (a) selective enrichment of phosphopeptides from non-phosphopeptides, (b) identification of mono- and multi-phosphopeptides, and (c) recognition of tyrosine phosphopeptides. The perovskite introduced into the monolith warrants high selectivity for phosphopeptides even at a high (10,000:1) ratio of non-phosphopeptides to phosphopeptides, and and enables identification of eight mono- and multi-phosphopeptides from standard beta-casein tryptic digests. Tyrosine phosphopeptides were specifically detected via the recognition capability of cucurbit[6]uril integrated into the monolith. The method has remarkably specific enrichment capacity for phosphopeptides from samples including human serum, nonfat milk, and human acute myelocytic leukemia cell lysate.

However, few studies are conducted in a clinical context to demonstrate its applicability in current clinical practice and workflow. Indeed, this translational research remains far from the patient's bedside for several reasons. First, samples are often cultured cell lines. Second, they are prepared on non-standard substrates for clinical routine. Third, a unique supervised classification model is usually constructed using inadequate cross-validation strategy. Finally, the implemented models maximize classification accuracy without taking into account the clinician's needs. In this paper, we address these issues through a diagnosis problem in real clinical conditions, i.e., the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia from fresh unstained blood smears spread on glass slides. From Raman data acquired in different experimental conditions, a repeated double cross-validation strategy was combined with different cross-validation approaches, a consensus label strategy and adaptive thresholds able to adapt to the clinician's needs.

Currently, a comprehensive apprehension on APL incidence across Europe has yet been established. Therefore, we conducted a population-based study to assess the incidence of APL across Europe. We selected all patients diagnosed with APL in Europe from the RARECAREnet database that holds data from 94 cancer registries across 27 European countries on rare malignancies diagnosed during 2000-2007. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the European pool per 100,000 person-years. Also, crude incidence rates with 95% CIs were calculated per 100,000 person-years by country. Overall, 1,876 patients with APL (48% male and 24% aged >/=65 years) were included in our analytic cohort. The overall ASR of APL was 0.112 (95% CI, 0.107-0.117) in Europe. The incidence of APL varied considerably across Europe, with the highest incidence in Spain (0.257; 95% CI, 0.205-0.317), as compared to the European average. Altogether, these finding adds additional support to the hypothesis that APL might be more prevalent among individuals with Spanish ancestry.

Mounting evidence suggested that PRMT1 is essential to embryonic development and tumor pathogenesis, but its role in normal adult hematopoiesis is less studied. We used a Prmt1 conditional knockout (KO) mouse model to identify the role of PRMT1 in normal adult hematopoiesis. The results indicated that deletion of PRMT1 results in anemia and leukopenia, reducing terminal erythroid and lymphocyte differentiation. Additionally, we found a significant decrease of megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) compared with similarly treated littermate control mice. The frequency of short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) populations were significantly lower in PRMT1(f/f)/Mx1-CRE bone marrow (BM) compared with littermate control mice. Importantly, in-vitro replating assays and BM transplantation results revealed that PRMT1 KO results in reduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) self-renewal capacity. Thus, we conclude that PRMT1 is required for hematopoietic differentiation and the competitive fitness of HSPCs, and we believed that PRMT1 serves as a key epigenetic regulator of normal hematopoiesis that occurs throughout life.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Zhu, Lei', 'He, Xin', 'Dong, Haojie', 'Sun, Jie', 'Wang, Hanying', 'Zhu, Yinghui', 'Huang, Feiteng', 'Zou, Jingying', 'Chen, Zexin', 'Zhao, Xiaoying', 'Li, Ling']","['Zhu L', 'He X', 'Dong H', 'Sun J', 'Wang H', 'Zhu Y', 'Huang F', 'Zou J', 'Chen Z', 'Zhao X', 'Li L']",,"['Department of clinical laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.', 'Department of Science and Development, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No. 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL141336/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191023,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,"['EC 2.1.1.319 (Prmt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6909962,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HSPCs', '*PTMT1', '*normal hematopoiesis']",2019/12/20 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.38859 [doi]', 'ijbsv15p2763 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2019 Oct 23;15(13):2763-2773. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.38859. eCollection 2019.,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced solid or hematologic malignancies were enrolled in dose-finding and cohort expansion phases. In dose-finding, once-daily or twice-daily (BID) ascending oral doses of CC-115 (range: 0.5-40 mg/day) in 28-day continuous cycles identified the maximum-tolerated dose for cohort expansion in 5 specified tumor types. Twelve additional patients with mixed solid tumors participated in a bioavailability substudy. Results: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the dose-finding cohort. Dose-limiting toxicity included thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, hyperglycemia, asthenia/fatigue, and increased transaminases. CC-115 10 mg BID was selected for cohort expansion (n=74) in which fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite were the most frequent toxicities. Dose-proportional PK was found. CC-115 distributed to glioblastoma tissue (mean tumor/plasma concentration ratio: 0.713). Total exposure of CC-115 was similar under fasting and fed conditions. A patient with endometrial carcinoma remained in complete remission >4 years. Partial response (PR; n=2) and stable disease (SD; n=4) were reported in the bioavailability substudy; SD was reached in 53%, 22%, 21%, and 64% of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and castration-resistant prostate cancer, respectively. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma showed 38% PR and 25% SD. Conclusion: CC-115 was well-tolerated, with toxicities consistent with mTOR inhibitors. Together with biomarker inhibition and preliminary efficacy, oral CC-115 10 mg BID is a promising novel anticancer treatment.

Subtle changes to the surface chemistry of nanoparticles can significantly affect their biological fate, including their propensity to associate with different cell populations. For instance, nanoparticles functionalized with thiol-reactive groups can potentially enhance association with cells that over-express cell-surface thiol groups. The potential of such an approach for enhancing drug delivery for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells has not been investigated. Herein, we investigate the impact of thiol-reactive star polymers on the cellular association and the mechanisms of uptake of the nanoparticles. Methods: We prepared fluorescently labeled star polymers functionalized with an mPEG brush corona and pyridyl disulfide to examine how reactivity to exofacial thiols impacts cellular association with ALL cells. We also studied how variations to the mPEG brush composition could potentially be used as a secondary method for controlling the extent of cell association. Specifically, we examined how the inclusion of shorter diethylene glycol brush moieties into the nanoparticle corona could be used to further influence cell association. Results: Star polymers incorporating both thiol-reactive and diethylene glycol brush moieties exhibited the highest cellular association, followed by those functionalized solely with thiol reactive groups compared to control nanoparticles in T and B pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts harvested from the spleens and bone marrow of immunodeficient mice. Transfection of cells with an early endosomal marker and imaging with correlative light and electron microscopy confirmed cellular uptake. Endocytosis inhibitors revealed dynamin-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the main uptake pathway for all the star polymers. Conclusion: Thiol-reactive star polymers having an mPEG brush corona that includes a proportion of diethylene glycol brush moieties represent a potential strategy for improved leukemia cell delivery.",['(c) 2019 Bayat et al.'],"['Bayat, Narges', 'McOrist, Nathan', 'Ariotti, Nicholas', 'Lai, May', 'Sia, Keith Cs', 'Li, Yuhuan', 'Grace, James L', 'Quinn, John F', 'Whittaker, Michael R',

Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins is a key mechanism that mediates the function of histone modifications, but how the dysregulation of these readers might contribute to disease remains poorly understood. We previously identified the ENL protein as a reader of histone acetylation via its YEATS domain, linking it to the expression of cancer-driving genes in acute leukaemia(1). Recurrent hotspot mutations have been found in the ENL YEATS domain in Wilms tumour(2,3), the most common type of paediatric kidney cancer. Here we show, using human and mouse cells, that these mutations impair cell-fate regulation by conferring gain-of-function in chromatin recruitment and transcriptional control. ENL mutants induce gene-expression changes that favour a premalignant cell fate, and, in an assay for nephrogenesis using murine cells, result in undifferentiated structures resembling those observed in human Wilms tumour. Mechanistically, although bound to largely similar genomic loci as the wild-type protein, ENL mutants exhibit increased occupancy at a subset of targets, leading to a marked increase in the recruitment and activity of transcription elongation machinery that enforces active transcription from target loci. Furthermore, ectopically expressed ENL mutants exhibit greater self-association and form discrete and dynamic nuclear puncta that are characteristic of biomolecular hubs consisting of local high concentrations of regulatory factors. Such mutation-driven ENL self-association is functionally linked to enhanced chromatin occupancy and gene activation. Collectively, our findings show that hotspot mutations in a chromatin-reader domain drive self-reinforced recruitment, derailing normal cell-fate control during development and leading to an oncogenic outcome.",,"['Wan, Liling', 'Chong, Shasha', 'Xuan, Fan', 'Liang, Angela', 'Cui, Xiaodong', 'Gates, Leah', 'Carroll, Thomas S', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Feng, Lijuan', 'Chen, Guochao', 'Wang, Shu-Ping', 'Ortiz, Michael V', 'Daley, Sara K', 'Wang, Xiaolu', 'Xuan, Hongwen', 'Kentsis, Alex', 'Muir, Tom W', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Li, Haitao', 'Li, Wei', 'Tjian, Robert', 'Wen, Hong', 'Allis, C David']","['Wan L', 'Chong S', 'Xuan F', 'Liang A', 'Cui X', 'Gates L', 'Carroll TS', 'Li Y', 'Feng L', 'Chen G', 'Wang SP', 'Ortiz MV', 'Daley SK', 'Wang X', 'Xuan H', 'Kentsis A', 'Muir TW', 'Roeder RG', 'Li H', 'Li W', 'Tjian R', 'Wen H', 'Allis CD']",,"['Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.

Whether the proliferative state originates from the cell-of-origin or emerges later remains difficult to resolve. By tracking de novo transformation from normal hematopoietic progenitors expressing an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) oncogene MLL-AF9, we reveal that the cell cycle rate heterogeneity among granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) determines their probability of transformation. A fast cell cycle intrinsic to these progenitors provide permissiveness for transformation, with the fastest cycling 3% GMPs acquiring malignancy with near certainty. Molecularly, we propose that MLL-AF9 preserves gene expression of the cellular states in which it is expressed. As such, when expressed in the naturally-existing, rapidly-cycling immature myeloid progenitors, this cell state becomes perpetuated, yielding malignancy. In humans, high CCND1 expression predicts worse prognosis for MLL fusion AMLs.

As a young Air Force pilot, Don Shields flew the B57 aircraft through the actual nuclear cloud during nuclear weapons blast explosions in Operation Dominic. The data he collected was of vital importance to our country's nuclear weapons program. Don Shields knew of the tremendous risk of radiation but served our country at the call of duty. After his military service, Don Shields served as the subject matter expert for the Apollo lunar module and worked directly with Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin in training them on the module. During the Apollo 11 mission, Don Shields was being interviewed by Walter Cronkite on the epic Moon landing coverage. Unfortunately, later in life Don Shields suffered from cataracts and leukemia, both of which are known to be related to high radiation exposures. During his old age, Don Shields volunteered at the NASA Ames Museum and inspired generations of young individuals towards the space mission.Douglas DB, Cagle Y.

The genome of the virus's most common subtype, HTLV-1A, encodes structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins that contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis. Among these is the p30 protein encoded by the doubly spliced Tax-orf II mRNA, a nuclear/nucleolar protein with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity. The p30 protein inhibits the productive replication cycle via nuclear retention of the mRNA that encodes for both the viral transcriptional trans-activator Tax, and the Rex proteins that regulate the transport of incompletely spliced viral mRNA to the cytoplasm. In myeloid cells, p30 inhibits the PU-1 transcription factor that regulates interferon expression and is a critical mediator of innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, p30 alters gene expression, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage responses in T-cells, raising the hypothesis that p30 may directly contribute to T cell transformation. By fine-tuning viral expression while also inhibiting host innate responses, p30 is likely essential for viral infection and persistence. This concept is supported by the finding that macaques, a natural host for the closely genetically related simian T-cell leukemia virus 1 (STLV-1), exposed to an HTLV-1 knockout for p30 expression by a single point mutation do not became infected unless reversion and selection of the wild type HTLV-1 genotype occurs. All together, these data suggest that inhibition of p30 may help to curb and eventually eradicate viral infection by exposing infected cells to an effective host immune response.",,"['Moles, Ramona', 'Sarkis, Sarkis', 'Galli, Veronica', 'Omsland, Maria', 'Purcell, Damian F J', 'Yurick, David', 'Khoury, Georges', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['Moles R', 'Sarkis S', 'Galli V', 'Omsland M', 'Purcell DFJ', 'Yurick D', 'Khoury G', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Franchini G']",,"['Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. franchig@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191218,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Macaca/virology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Virus Latency/*genetics']",PMC6921414,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATLL', '*Adaptive immunity', '*Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis', '*Innate immunity', '*Tax-orf-II', '*orf-II', '*p30']",2019/12/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/12/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0501-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0501-2 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Dec 18;16(1):42. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0501-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate mutation frequency, spectrum, and pattern in the Korean patients with T-ALL. We designed a multigene panel targeting 101 genes and validated it using 10 reference materials. The mutation analysis was done in a total of 10 patients with T-ALL. Clinical data and laboratory tests including immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular genetic tests were also investigated. All of the 10 patients harbored at least one mutation (range 1-6 per patient). A total of 34 clinically significant mutations including 15 novel mutations were identified in 23 genes. The median of variant allelic frequencies (VAFs) and blasts were counted upto 33% (range 5-91%) and 79% (range 38-90%), respectively. Recurrent mutations were involved in epigenetic regulators (60%), NOTCH1 signaling (40%), PI3K-AKT (40%), JAK-STAT (30%), and transcription factors (30%). We found that both NOTCH signaling and JAK-STAT signaling were positively associated with epigenetic regulators, while showed mutually exclusive patterns with PI3K-AKT pathway. This study showed that the frequency of mutations in epigenetic regulators in Korean patients was significantly higher than expected. Distribution of VAF as well as mutation spectrum is considerably heterogeneous in Korean patients with T-ALL.

Here, we present an unusual clinical course wherein a patient with HS treated with splenectomy developed secondary myelofibrosis and acute monocytic leukemia (M5). PATIENT CONCERNS: After presenting with paleness, fatigue and jaundice, the patient was diagnosed with HS. After splenectomy, follow-up testing, including bone marrow biopsy, revealed myelofibrosis. Subsequently, the patient exhibited blood cell abnormalities consistent with M5. DIAGNOSIS: M5 comorbid with myelofibrosis and a history of HS. INTERVENTIONS: HS was treated with splenectomy. Myelofibrosis was treated with hydroxyurea. The patient refused chemotherapy for M5 and was discharged. He was maintained on hydroxyurea and received periodic blood product transfusions with regular routine blood test monitoring. OUTCOMES: Because of intracranial hemorrhage, the patient died on May 17, 2018, a little >10 months after being diagnosed with leukemia.

In Bahia, Brazil, we recently reported that 47% of IDH patients also develop juvenile HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a progressive disabling disorder which is typically reported in adult HTLV-1 carriers. IDH may also predispose to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, a neoplasm associated with HTLV-1. The factors relating to the development of HTLV-1-associated juvenile diseases have not yet been defined. HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) is one of the main parameters related to the development of HTLV-1 associated diseases in adults. In the current study, we investigated the role of PVL in IDH and juvenile HAM/TSP. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is a cohort study that included fifty-nine HTLV-1 infected children and adolescents, comprising 16 asymptomatic carriers, 18 IDH patients, 20 patients with IDH and HAM/TSP (IDH/HAM/TSP) and five with HAM/TSP. These patients were followed-up for up to 14 years (median of 8 years). We found that PVL in IDH and IDH/HAM/TSP patients were similarly higher than PVL in juvenile asymptomatic carriers (p<0.0001). In those IDH patients who developed HAM/TSP during follow-up, PVL levels did not vary significantly. HAM/TSP development did not occur in those IDH patients who presented high levels of PVL. IDH remission was associated with an increase of PVL. Inter-individual differences in PVL were observed within all groups. However, intra-individual PVL did not fluctuate significantly during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: High PVL in IDH patients was not necessary indicative of progression to HAM/TSP. PVL did not decrease after IDH remission. The maintenance of high PVL after remission could favor early development of ATL. Therefore, IDH patients would have to be followed-up even after remission of IDH and for a long period of time.",,"['Batista, Everton S', 'Oliveira, Pedro D', 'Primo, Janeusa', 'Varandas, Cinthya Maria Neves', 'Nunes, Ana Paula', 'Bittencourt, Achilea L', 'Farre, Lourdes']","['Batista ES', 'Oliveira PD', 'Primo J', 'Varandas CMN', 'Nunes AP', 'Bittencourt AL', 'Farre L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5982-132X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3168-1940']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Goncalo Moniz Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (CPQGM/FIOCRUZ), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Prof. Edgard Santos Teaching Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', ""Neuropediatric Department, Santo Antonio Hospital of Sister Dulce's Social Work, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."", ""Neuropediatric Department, Santo Antonio Hospital of Sister Dulce's Social Work, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."", 'Department of Pathology, Prof. Edgard Santos Teaching Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Prof. Edgard Santos Teaching Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Goncalo Moniz Research Center, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (CPQGM/FIOCRUZ), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', ""ProCURE Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology, IDIBELL, l'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191218,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*pathology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification', '*Viral Load']",PMC6946163,,,,2019/12/19 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0007705 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-19-00296 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2019 Dec 18;13(12):e0007705. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007705. eCollection 2019 Dec.,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EFS in the GO arm was not significantly different compared with that in the standard arm (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.04; P = .10). The early death rate during induction therapy was 10.3% in the GO arm and 5.7% in the standard arm (P = .05). Causes of death in both arms were mainly infections. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients achieving a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was significantly reduced in the GO arm compared with the standard arm (P = .005), with no difference in the cumulative incidence of death (P = .80). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant beneficial effect of GO in female, younger (</= 70 years), and FLT3 internal tandem duplication-negative patients with respect to EFS and CIR. CONCLUSION: The trial did not meet its early primary end point of EFS, mainly as a result of a higher early death rate in the GO arm. However, in patients achieving CR/CRi after induction therapy, significantly fewer relapses occurred in the GO compared with the standard arm.",,"['Schlenk, Richard F', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Krzykalla, Julia', 'Weber, Daniela', 'Kapp-Schwoerer, Silke', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Leis, Claudia', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Schroeder, Thomas', 'Mayer, Karin', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Wattad, Mohammed', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Horst, Heinz A', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Wulf, Gerald', 'Schleicher, Jan', 'Bentz, Martin', 'Greil, Richard', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Martens, Uwe', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Abu Samra, Maisun', 'Girschikofsky, Michael', 'Basara, Nadezda', 'Benner, Axel', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Schlenk RF', 'Paschka P', 'Krzykalla J', 'Weber D', 'Kapp-Schwoerer S', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Leis C', 'Fiedler W', 'Kindler T', 'Schroeder T', 'Mayer K', 'Lubbert M', 'Wattad M', 'Gotze K', 'Horst HA', 'Koller E', 'Wulf G', 'Schleicher J', 'Bentz M', 'Greil R', 'Hertenstein B', 'Krauter J', 'Martens U', 'Nachbaur D', 'Abu Samra M', 'Girschikofsky M', 'Basara N', 'Benner A', 'Thol F', 'Heuser M', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin I, Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Essen-Werden, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hanuschkrankenhaus Wien, Wien, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Klinikum der Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stadtisches Klinikum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'IIIrd Medical Department, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg;

Thanks to these agents, CML has been transformed from a disease with limited treatment options and a dismal prognosis into a more indolent disease with survival comparable to that of the general population. The need for ongoing TKI therapy remains controversial for several reasons, including cost and toxicity. Studies in CML patients with a sustained deep molecular response have demonstrated that stopping TKI therapy is feasible and safe. Given the heterogeneity of results reported in clinical trials, practice guidelines for optimal patient selection and proper monitoring after discontinuation of TKIs are proposed outside of clinical trials. Current data available show that 40% to 60% of patients who stop therapy relapse; molecular relapses typically occur within 6 months, but nearly all relapsing patients regain response upon reinitiation of the TKI. Several factors that predict for relapse have been investigated. Duration of prior TKI therapy, achievement of deep molecular response, depth of molecular response, prior interferon treatment, and Sokal risk score have been shown to be potential predictors for relapse. Leukemia stem cells that are resistant to TKIs, and that persist despite undetectable BCR/ABL1 transcript levels, likely are responsible for disease relapse after discontinuation. Efforts geared toward better identification of low levels of BCR/ABL1 transcript using new techniques such as digital polymerase chain reaction, along with eradicating CML clones using combination therapies with agents such as pegylated interferon or venetoclax with TKIs, will hopefully lead to a functional cure of this disease.",,"['Molica, Matteo', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Paul, Shilpa', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jabbour, Elias J']","['Molica M', 'Naqvi K', 'Cortes JE', 'Paul S', 'Kadia TM', 'Breccia M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jabbour EJ']",,"['Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",,,,,2019/12/19 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2019 Dec;17(12):686-696.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review summarizes the current immunotherapeutic landscape with a focus on key clinical trials for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Chemotherapy resistance remains a major barrier to cure in children with high-risk leukemias. Immunotherapy approaches have potential to overcome this resistance given alternative mechanisms of action. Based upon preclinical activity and/or success in adult patients, recent clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy of various mAb, antibody-drug conjugate, bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody, natural killer cell, and chimeric antigen receptor-redirected T-cell immunotherapies for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Food and Drug Administration approval of several of these immunotherapies has increased the pediatric leukemia therapeutic portfolio and improved clinical outcomes for previously incurable patients. SUMMARY: Several antibody-based or cellular immunotherapy modalities have demonstrated appreciable efficacy in children with relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory leukemia via early-phase clinical trials. Some studies have also identified critical biomarkers of treatment response and resistance that merit further investigation. Continued preclinical and clinical evaluation of novel immunotherapies is imperative to improve cure rates for children with high-risk leukemias.",,"['Bonifant, Challice L', 'Tasian, Sarah K']","['Bonifant CL', 'Tasian SK']",,"['Department of Pediatrics.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA232486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific', 'Child', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC7088436,['NIHMS1575632'],,,2019/12/19 06:00,2020/08/08 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000866 [doi]', '00008480-202002000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2020 Feb;32(1):13-25. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000866.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Parvovirus B19 DNA by Real-Time-PCR retrospectively in clinical samples of children diagnosed as acute leukemia and aplastic anemia when investigating the cause of pancytopenia and to investigate its relationship with the clinical manifestations. METHODS: The study samples were collected between March 2014 and March 2018 in Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology. Sixty pediatric patients; 37 males and 23 females, were included in the study. Nucleic acid isolation was performed by using MagNA-Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche, Germany). Extracted DNA was studied with LightCycler(R) 2.0 using the Real-Time PCR method and LightCycler(R) Parvovirus B19 Quantification Kit (Roche, Germany), and the results were evaluated quantitatively. Parvovirus B19 DNA detection interval of the kit was 101 - 106 copies/mL. RESULTS: Sixty serum samples were investigated and 8.3% (5/60) Parvovirus B19 DNA positivity was determined. Of the five patients with Parvovirus B19 DNA positivity, three had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and two were diagnosed as aplastic anemia. Regarding viral load; 2/5, 1/5, 1/5, and 1/5 of the samples had a viral load of 102, 103, 104, and 105 copies/mL, respectively. Parvovirus B19 DNA positivity was detected in samples from March (2/5), April (2/5), and August (1/5). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute leukemia and aplastic anemia in childhood using immunosuppressive drugs, blood, and blood products during chemotherapy, encounter Parvovirus B19 infections in the follow-up period and are diagnosed by serological and molecular methods. As a result of the study, we suggest that the detection of Parvovirus B19 DNA by Real-Time PCR method in children being admitted with pancytopenia and diagnosed as acute leukemia and aplastic anemia is useful in the follow-up and treatment.",,"['Colak, Meryem', 'Kocak, Aylin A', 'Dinc, Bedia', 'Kaya, Zuhre', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Bozdayi, Gulendam']","['Colak M', 'Kocak AA', 'Dinc B', 'Kaya Z', 'Kocak U', 'Yenicesu I', 'Bozdayi G']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Erythema Infectiosum/complications/*diagnosis/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pancytopenia/blood/complications/*diagnosis', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2019/12/19 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190311 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2019 Dec 1;65(12). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190311.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common pretransfusion platelet count range for inpatients was 20,000 to 50,000/muL, for outpatients it was 10,000 to 20,000/muL. Among ICU patients, 35% of platelet transfusion episodes had a platelet count of greater than 50,000/muL; this was only 8% for general ward and 2% for outpatients. The median posttransfusion increment, not corrected for platelet dose and/or patient size, ranged from 12,000 to 20,000/muL for inpatients, and from 17,000 to 27,000/muL for outpatients.

In the closed conformation, the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains pack against the back of the kinase domain, providing allosteric control of kinase activity. Small molecule ligands that engage the regulatory SH3-SH2 region have the potential to modulate Src-family kinase activity for therapeutic advantage. Here we describe an HTS-compatible fluorescence polarization assay to identify small molecules that interact with the unique-SH3-SH2-linker (U32L) region of Hck, a Src-family member expressed exclusively in cells of myeloid lineage. Hck has significant potential as a drug target in acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive form of cancer with substantial unmet clinical need. The assay combines recombinant Hck U32L protein with a fluorescent probe peptide that binds to the SH3 domain in U32L, resulting in an increased FP signal. Library compounds that interact with the U32L protein and interfere with probe binding reduce the FP signal, scoring as hits. Automated 384-well high-throughput screening of 60,000 compounds yielded Z'-factor coefficients > 0.7 across nearly 200 assay plates, and identified a series of hit compounds with a shared pyrimidine diamine substructure. Surface plasmon resonance assays confirmed direct binding of hit compounds to the Hck U32L target protein as well as near-full-length Hck. Binding was not observed with the individual SH3 and SH2 domains, demonstrating that these compounds recognize a specific three-dimensional conformation of the regulatory regions. This conclusion is supported by computational docking studies, which predict ligand contacts with a pocket formed by the juxtaposition of the SH3 domain, the SH3-SH2 domain connector, and the SH2-kinase linker. Each of the four validated hits stimulated recombinant, near-full-length Hck activity in vitro, providing evidence for allosteric effects on the kinase domain. These results provide a path to discovery and development of chemical scaffolds to target the regulatory regions of Hck and other Src family kinases as a new approach to pharmacological kinase control.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Dorman, Close, Wingert, Camacho, Johnston and Smithgall.']","['Dorman, Heather R', 'Close, David', 'Wingert, Bentley M', 'Camacho, Carlos J', 'Johnston, Paul A', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Dorman HR', 'Close D', 'Wingert BM', 'Camacho CJ', 'Johnston PA', 'Smithgall TE']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', 'Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', 'Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA233576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM097082/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20191128,Switzerland,Front Chem,Frontiers in chemistry,101627988,,,,PMC6893557,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hck kinase', 'SH2 and SH3 domains', 'Src-family kinase', 'allosteric action', 'fluorescence polarization assay', 'high throughput screening']",2019/12/19 06:00,2019/12/19 06:01,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fchem.2019.00822 [doi]'],epublish,Front Chem. 2019 Nov 28;7:822. doi: 10.3389/fchem.2019.00822. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FUS-ERG+ AML is rare but has an extremely poor prognosis even with allo-HSCT in remission, possibly due to its a leukemia stem cell (LSC)-driven disease resulting in chemotherapy resistance and a novel therapy is urgently required. It has been reported that FUS-ERG-positive AML expresses CD123, a marker of LSC, in some cases. CD123-targeted CAR T cell (CART123) is promising immunotherapy, but how to improve the complete remission (CR) rate and rescue potential hematopoietic toxicity still need to explore. Case Presentation: We used donor-derived CART123 as part of conditioning regimen for haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) in a patient with FUS-ERG+ AML who relapsed after allogeneic transplantation within 3 months, resists to multi-agent chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and remained non-remission, aiming to reduce these chemotherapy-resistant blasts and rescue potential hematopoietic toxicity. The blasts in BM were reduced within 2 weeks and coincided with CAR copies expansion after CART123 infusion. The patient achieved full donor chimerism, CR with incomplete blood count recovery, and myeloid implantation. Conclusion: Our results hints that CART123 reduces the chemotherapy-resistant AML blasts for FUS-ERG+ AML without affecting the full donor chimerism and myeloid implantation.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Yao, Jianlin, Yarong, Botao, Qinghan, Hongliang, Lu, Hongmei,', 'Pin, Hu, Liangding and Bin.']","['Yao, Sun', 'Jianlin, Chen', 'Yarong, Liu', 'Botao, Li', 'Qinghan, Wang', 'Hongliang, Fang', 'Lu, Zhang', 'Hongmei, Ning', 'Pin, Wang', 'Hu, Chen', 'Liangding, Hu', 'Bin, Zhang']","['Yao S', 'Jianlin C', 'Yarong L', 'Botao L', 'Qinghan W', 'Hongliang F', 'Lu Z', 'Hongmei N', 'Pin W', 'Hu C', 'Liangding H', 'Bin Z']",,"[""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'R&D Department, HRAIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'R&D Department, HRAIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'R&D Department, HRAIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'R&D Department, HRAIN Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research, Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Cell and Gene Therapy Center, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research, Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Cell and Gene Therapy Center, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Former 307th Hospital of PLA), The Research Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20191203,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6901822,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD123', 'FUS-ERG', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'graft-vs-host disease']",2019/12/19 06:00,2019/12/19 06:01,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01358 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Dec 3;9:1358. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01358. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HBV derived X protein (HBX) is the most potent carcinogenic factor for HCC, however, the molecular mechanism of HBX-induced transformation of hepatic cells in HCC is poorly understood. We have shown that nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) is essential for the spatial repression of global transcription by the promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (PODs), a frequent target of viral oncoproteins like HBX and that disintegration of PODs due to misfolded conformation dependent loss (MCDL) of NCoR is linked to promyelocytic and monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given the key role of NCoR in cellular homeostasis across various tissue subtypes, we hypothesized that HBX-induced MCDL of NCoR might be linked to HCC through similar mechanism. Based on this hypothesis, the conformation of NCoR in HCC derived tumor cells and primary human tissue sections were analyzed and a selective MCDL of NCoR in HBX positive HCC cells was identified. HBX triggered the misfolding of NCoR through ubiquitination, followed by its degradation by autophagy, thus suggesting a cross talk between ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy lysosomal pathway (ALP) in MCDL of NCoR in HBX positive HCC cells. SiRNA-induced NCoR ablation selectively impaired the growth and survival of HBX positive HCC cells, suggesting a role of MCDL in the growth and survival of HBX positive HCC cells. These finding identify a possible crosstalk between UPS and ALP in the misfolding and loss of NCoR in HBX positive HCC cells and suggest a role of autophagic recycling of misfolded NCoR in the activation of oncogenic metabolic signaling in HCC. The misfolded NCoR reported in this study represents a novel conformation based molecular target which could be valuable in the design and development of tumor cell specific diagnostic and therapeutic approach for HBX positive HCC.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Tan, Visvanathan, Abu Hassan and Khan.']","['Tan, Su Yin', 'Visvanathan, Sridevi', 'Abu Hassan, Radzi', 'Khan, Matiullah']","['Tan SY', 'Visvanathan S', 'Abu Hassan R', 'Khan M']",,"['Bio-Rad Laboratories, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Departments of Biochemistry, AIMST University, Bedong, Malaysia.', 'Clinical Research Center, Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, AIMST University, Bedong, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191203,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6902082,,['NOTNLM'],"['HBX', 'HCC', 'NCoR', 'autophagy', 'misfolded protein']",2019/12/19 06:00,2019/12/19 06:01,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01335 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Dec 3;9:1335. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01335. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined whether chidamide enhanced the cytotoxicity of drugs in AML cells by affecting H3K9me3 and autophagy levels. AML cells (THP-1 and MV4-11 cells) were treated with chidamide, cytarabine (Ara-c), or sorafenib alone or in combination. Cell proliferation and survival rates were analyzed by MTT, flow cytometry, and Western blotting assays. The results showed that a low dose of chidamide enhanced the cytotoxicity of Ara-c or sorafenib in AML cells, decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis. H3K9me3 levels as assessed by Western blotting were upregulated by chidamide treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, which was used to investigate potential signaling pathways, indicated that the autophagy pathway might play a role in the effects of chidamide. The level of autophagy induced in AML cells upon treatment with Ara-c or sorafenib was inhibited by chidamide, and autophagy markers (LC3, P62) were tested by Western blotting. SIRT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were lower in AML cells treated with Ara-c or sorafenib in combination with chidamide than those in cells treated with these drugs alone. Additionally, the Integrative Genomics Viewer results indicate that the H3K9me3 changes were related to SIRT1-binding sites. Together, these results show that chidamide enhances the cytotoxicity of two chemotherapy drugs in AML cells by increasing the H3K9me3 level and inhibiting autophagy via decreasing the expression of SIRT1. Chidamide may be a potential treatment strategy for AML in the future, especially for refractory AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Huang, Wenbing, Dong, He, Yao and Guo.']","['Huang, He', 'Wenbing, Yang', 'Dong, Aishu', 'He, Zhewei', 'Yao, Rongxing', 'Guo, Wenjian']","['Huang H', 'Wenbing Y', 'Dong A', 'He Z', 'Yao R', 'Guo W']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China."", ""Department of Emergency, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China."", 'The Second Clinic College of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191203,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6901797,,['NOTNLM'],"['H3K9me3', 'SIRT1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'autophagy', 'chidamide']",2019/12/19 06:00,2019/12/19 06:01,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01276 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Dec 3;9:1276. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01276. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, the quality and the kinetic of the immune cell reconstitution (IR) certainly play a major role and several experimental efforts have been greatly endorsed to better understand and accelerate the post-transplant recovery of a fully competent immune system in haplo-HSCT. In particular, the IR of innate immune system is receiving a growing interest, as it recovers much earlier than T and B cells and it is able to rapidly exert protective effects against both tumor relapses, GvHD and the onset of life-threatening opportunistic infections. Herein, we review our current knowledge in regard to the kinetic and clinical impact of Natural Killer (NK), gammadelta and Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) IRs in both allogeneic and haplo-HSCT. The present paper also provides an overview of those new therapeutic strategies currently being implemented to boost the alloreactivity of the above-mentioned innate immune effectors in order to ameliorate the prognosis of patients affected by hematologic malignancies and undergone transplant procedures.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Zaghi, Calvi, Di Vito and Mavilio.']","['Zaghi, Elisa', 'Calvi, Michela', 'Di Vito, Clara', 'Mavilio, Domenico']","['Zaghi E', 'Calvi M', 'Di Vito C', 'Mavilio D']",,"['Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies and Translational Medicine (BioMeTra), University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies and Translational Medicine (BioMeTra), University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191128,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6892976,,['NOTNLM'],"['*alloreactivity', '*haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*immune-reconstitution', '*innate lymphocytes', '*innate lymphoid cells', '*natural killer cells', '*gammadelta T cells']",2019/12/19 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02794 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Nov 28;10:2794. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02794. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML has a poor prognosis and a high incidence of relapse due to therapeutic resistance. Azelaic acid (AZA), a small molecular compound is known to exhibit antitumor effect on various tumor cells. This study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative and immunoregulatory effects of AZA against AMLviathe activation of the notch signaling pathway. We found that AZA can inhibit the proliferation of AML cells. In addition, laser confocal microscopy showed AZA-treated AML cells began to swelling and undergo cytoplasmic vacuolization. Importantly, AZA promoted the proliferation of NK and T cells and increased the secretion of TNF-alphaand IFN-gamma. AZA also increased the expression levels of CD107a and TRAIL in NK cells, and CD25 and CD69 in T cells to influence their activation and cytotoxic ability. AZA-treated NK cells can kill AML cells more efficiently at the single-cell level as observed under the microfluidic chips. Further mechanistic analysis using protein mass spectrometry analysis and Notch signaling reporter assay demonstrated that Notch1and Notch2 were up-regulated and the Notch signaling pathway was activated. Moreover, combining AZA with the Notch inhibitor, RO4929097, decreased the expression of Notch1and Notch2, and downstream HES1 and HEY1, which rendered AML cells insensitive to AZA-induced apoptosis and alleviated AZA-mediated cytotoxicity in AML. In vivo, AZA relieved the leukemic spleen infiltration and extended the survival. The percentage of CD3(-)CD56(+)NK cells and CD4(+)CD8(+)T cells as well as the secretion of cytotoxic cytokines was increased after the treatment of AZA. The overall findings reveal that AZA is a potential Notch agonist against AML in activating the Notch signaling pathway.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Dongdong, Jin, Yang, Yang, Wu, Chen, Luo, Liang, Liu, Xu,', 'Tong, Can, Ding, Tu, Tan, Jiang, Liu, Shen, Liu, Pan, Wei and Zhou.']","['Dongdong, Zhang', 'Jin, Yanxia', 'Yang, Tian', 'Yang, Qian', 'Wu, Balu', 'Chen, Yanling', 'Luo, Ziyi', 'Liang, Li', 'Liu, Yunjiao', 'Xu, Anjie', 'Tong, Xiqin', 'Can, Can', 'Ding, Lu', 'Tu, Honglei', 'Tan, Yuxin', 'Jiang, Hongqiang', 'Liu, Xiaoyan', 'Shen, Hui', 'Liu, Li', 'Pan, Yunbao', 'Wei, Yongchang', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Dongdong Z', 'Jin Y', 'Yang T', 'Yang Q', 'Wu B', 'Chen Y', 'Luo Z', 'Liang L', 'Liu Y', 'Xu A', 'Tong X', 'Can C', 'Ding L', 'Tu H', 'Tan Y', 'Jiang H', 'Liu X', 'Shen H', 'Liu L', 'Pan Y', 'Wei Y', 'Zhou F']",,"['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Naso-Structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191129,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6901913,,['NOTNLM'],"['Notch agonist', 'Notch signaling pathway', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'azelaic acid', 'immunoregulatory']",2019/12/19 06:00,2019/12/19 06:01,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.01396 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Nov 29;10:1396. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.01396. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch pathway has been proven to be involved in many biological processes and diseases, especially AML. In this study, we aimed to explore genes correlated with Notch1 pathway in AML and determine their roles in the regulation of AML progression and chemoresistance. Methods: TCGA database was used to explore Notch1 associated genes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of genes. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to examine the expression of genes. The expression of PRKD2 was up-regulated or knocked down in AML cell lines by lentivirus or siRNAs. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were used to analyze the effect of PRKD2 on cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Results: Based on TCGA database, PRKD2 was found to be positively correlated with Notch1 expression, cytogenetic risk status and poorer prognosis in AML. Moreover, the expression level of PRKD2 was higher in AML chemo-resistant cells than in chemo-sensitive cells. Functionally, knockdown of PRKD2-induced apoptosis and increased chemosensitivity of AML cells. PRKD2 overexpression promoted proliferation and chemoresistance of AML cells. Furthermore, we found PRKD2 could regulate Notch1 pathway. Besides, high PRKD2 expression was correlated with higher risk group of AML patients which indicated that PRKD2 was an independent prognostic marker for AML. Conclusion: Taken together, our results showed that PRKD2 could promote the proliferation and chemoresistance of AML cells by regulating Notch1 pathway. The study broadened our insights into the underlying mechanisms in chemoresistance and proliferation of AML, and provided a new prognostic marker and treatment target for AML.",['(c) 2019 Liu et al.'],"['Liu, Qian', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Jian, Jimo', 'Han, Shijie', 'Liu, Chao', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhu, Xunxun', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Min', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Liu Q', 'Li W', 'Zhou Y', 'Jian J', 'Han S', 'Liu C', 'Li W', 'Zhu X', 'Ma D', 'Ji M', 'Ji C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0031-2894', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7502-6104']","[""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pain, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University (Qingdao), Qingdao 266000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tengzhou Central People's Hospital, Tengzhou 277599, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Immunohematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191212,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6913764,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Notch1', 'PRDK2', 'chemoresistance', 'progression']",2019/12/19 06:00,2019/12/19 06:01,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S233234 [doi]', '233234 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Dec 12;12:10931-10941. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S233234. eCollection 2019.,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To resolve these inconsistencies, we systematically analyzed the available data to determine whether SPP1 and SPP2 are prognostic markers in the context of human cancer. METHODS: The expression of SPP1 and SPP2 was assessed by Oncomine analysis. The PrognoScan database was used to assess the prognostic value of SPP1 and SPP2, with cBioPortal used to assess copy number variations. The STRING database was used to generate a Protein - Protein Interaction (PPI) network for SPP genes. RESULTS: SPP1 was more likely to be over-expressed in breast, bladder, colorectal, head, neck, liver, lung, and esophageal cancers. SPP2 was expressed at lower levels in colorectal cancer, leukemia, liver cancer and pancreatic cancer. In addition, SPP1 and SPP2 mutations mainly occurred in cutaneous melanoma and endometrial cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SPP1 and SPP2 may be effective therapeutic or diagnostic targets in certain cancers. Further research is required to confirm these results and verify the value of SPP1 and SPP2 as clinical markers of cancer prognosis.",,"['Tu, Yaqin', 'Chen, Cai', 'Fan, Guorun']","['Tu Y', 'Chen C', 'Fan G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9382-7098'],"['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. guorun2006@126.com.']",['eng'],"['81500796/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '02.03.2017-321/Research fund of Wuhan Union hospital']",['Journal Article'],20191218,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (SPP2 protein, human)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Osteopontin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptome']",PMC6918603,,['NOTNLM'],"['Expression', 'Human cancer', 'Prognosis', 'Secreted phosphoprotein 1', 'Secreted phosphoprotein 2']",2019/12/19 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6441-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6441-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Dec 18;19(1):1230. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6441-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with unmutated IGHV (>/=98% identity to the germline sequence) have inferior prognosis and tend to carry unfavorable genetic markers compared to those with mutated IGHV (<98% identity to the germline sequence). However, 98% as the cutoff for IGHV mutational status is a mathematical choice and remains controversial. We have previously reported distinct IGHV repertoire features between Chinese and western CLL populations. Here, we retrospectively studied 595 Chinese CLL patients to determine the best cutoff value for IGHV in Chinese CLL population. Using 1% as the interval for IGHV identity, we divided the studied cohort into seven subgroups from 95% to 100%. Briefer time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) were observed in cases with >/=98% compared to those with <98%, while the differences were obscure within subgroups >/=98% (98%-98.99%, 99%-99.99%, and 100%) and <98% (<94.99%, 95%-95.99%, 96%-96.99%, and 97%-97.99%). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of 98% being the cutoff for IGHV identity in terms of both TTFT and OS. All the prognostic factors, including del(17p13), del(11q22.3), TP53 mutation, MYD88 mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, SF3B1 mutation, CD38, ZAP-70, Binet staging, gender, and beta2-microglobulin, were significantly different in distribution between group <98% and group >/=98%, but not among subgroups 98%-98.99%, 99%-99.99%, and 100%.

These observations prompted us to hypothesize that HMGB1 and histone H3 liberated from leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis after chemotherapy might play a role in development of DIC. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively measured plasma levels of coagulation markers and intranuclear proteins in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (n = 17) before and after chemotherapy. Ten of 17 patients were diagnosed with DIC at the time of diagnosis of leukemia. Serum levels of HMGB1 and histone H3 were significantly higher in patients with DIC than in non-DIC patients. Of note, seven patients developed DIC or experienced exacerbation of coagulopathy after administration of anti-leukemic agents. Intriguingly, an increase in levels of HMGB1 and histone H3 were detected in five of seven patients. These findings suggest that intranuclear proteins spontaneously released from leukemia cells may play a role in development of leukemia-related DIC. Additionally, remission induction chemotherapy causes apoptosis of leukemia cells, leading to forced release of intranuclear proteins, which may exacerbate coagulopathy.",,"['Harada-Shirado, Kayo', 'Wang, Xintao', 'Mori, Hirotaka', 'Fukatsu, Masahiko', 'Takahashi, Hiroshi', 'Shichishima-Nakamura, Akiko', 'Kimura, Satoshi', 'Ohkawara, Hiroshi', 'Yamada, Shingo', 'Ito, Takashi', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki']","['Harada-Shirado K', 'Wang X', 'Mori H', 'Fukatsu M', 'Takahashi H', 'Shichishima-Nakamura A', 'Kimura S', 'Ohkawara H', 'Yamada S', 'Ito T', 'Ikezoe T']",,"['Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan.', 'Shino-Test Corporation, R&D Center, Sagamihara, Japan.', 'Department of Systems Biology in Thromboregulation, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Hikarigaoka-1, Fukushima, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan. ikezoet@fmu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['18K07419/Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(C)'],['Journal Article'],20191217,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'HMGB1 Protein/blood/*metabolism', 'Histones/blood/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Activation']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'HMGB1', 'Histone H3', 'Tumor lysis']",2019/12/19 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02798-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02798-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Mar;111(3):378-387. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02798-5.

METHODS: Forty-two elderly AML patients treated with intravenous or subcutaneous LIC (1 month for each course, at least 3 courses) or oral QHP (3 months for each course, at least 2 courses) were retrospectively analyzed from January 2015 to December 2017. The main endpoints of analysis were OS and 1-, 2-, 3-year OS rates of patients, respectively. And the adverse reactions induding bone marrow suppression, digestive tract discomfort and myocardia injury were observed. RESULTS: Out of 42 elderly AML patients, 22 received LIC treatment and 20 received QHP treatment, according to patients' preference. There was no significant difference on OS between LIC and QHP patients (13.0 months vs. 13.5 months, >0.05). There was no significant difference on OS rates between LIC and QHP groups at 1 year (59.1% vs. 70.0%), 2 years (13.6% vs. 15%), and 3 years (4.6% vs. 5.0%, all >0.05). Furthermore, there was no significant difference of OS on prognosis stratification of performance status > 2 (12 months vs. 12 months), age> 75 year-old (12.0 months vs. 12.5 months), hematopoietic stem cell transplant comorbidity index >2 (12 months vs. 13 months), poor cytogenetics (12 months vs. 8 months), and diagnosis of secondary AML (10 months vs. 14 months) between LIC and QHP patients (>0.05).

Recurrent somatic mutations have been identified in a core set of pathogenic genes including FLT3 (25-30% prevalence), NPM1 (25-30%), DNMT3A (25-30%), IDH1/2 (5-15%), and TET2 (5-15%), with direct diagnostic, prognostic, and targeted therapeutic implications. Advances in the understanding of the complex mechanisms of AML leukemogenesis have led to the development and recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several targeted therapies: midostaurin and gilteritinib targeting activated FLT3, and ivosidenib and enasidenib targeting mutated IDH1/2. Several additional drug candidates targeting other recurrently mutated gene pathways in AML are also being actively developed. Furthermore, outside of the realm of predicting responses to targeted therapies, many other mutated genes, which comprise the so-called long tail of oncogenic drivers in AML, have been shown to provide clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic information for AML patients. Many of these recurrently mutated genes have also been shown to be excellent biomarkers for post-treatment minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring for assessing treatment response and predicting future relapse. In addition, the identification of germline mutations in a set of genes predisposing to myeloid malignancies may directly inform treatment decisions (particularly stem cell transplantation) and impact other family members. Recent advances in sequencing technology have made it practically and economically feasible to evaluate many genes simultaneously using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Mutation screening with NGS panels has been recommended by national and international professional guidelines as the standard of care for AML patients. NGS-based detection of the heterogeneous genes commonly mutated in AML has practical clinical utility for disease diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of targeted therapy response, and MRD monitoring.",,"['Yang, Fei', 'Anekpuritanang, Tauangtham', 'Press, Richard D']","['Yang F', 'Anekpuritanang T', 'Press RD']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2103-5144'],"['Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, L113, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, L113, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, L113, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. pressr@ohsu.edu.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA. pressr@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Disease Management', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis']",,,,,2019/12/19 06:00,2021/01/29 06:00,['2019/12/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40291-019-00443-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40291-019-00443-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2020 Feb;24(1):1-13. doi: 10.1007/s40291-019-00443-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, various barriers restrict the efficacy and/or prevent the widespread use of CAR T cell therapies in these patients as well as in those with other cancers, particularly solid tumours. Key challenges relating to CAR T cells include severe toxicities, restricted trafficking to, infiltration into and activation within tumours, suboptimal persistence in vivo, antigen escape and heterogeneity, and manufacturing issues. The evolution of CAR designs beyond the conventional structures will be necessary to address these limitations and to expand the use of CAR T cells to a wider range of malignancies. Investigators are addressing the current obstacles with a wide range of engineering strategies in order to improve the safety, efficacy and applicability of this therapeutic modality.

We investigated the efficacy of a novel nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitor, OT-82, against a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established from high-risk and poor outcome pediatric ALL cases. OT-82 was well-tolerated and demonstrated impressive single agent in vivo efficacy, achieving significant leukemia growth delay in 95% (20/21) and disease regression in 86% (18/21) of PDXs. In addition, OT-82 enhanced the efficacy of the established drugs cytarabine and dasatinib and, as a single agent, showed similar efficacy as an induction-type regimen combining three drugs used to treat pediatric ALL. OT-82 exerted its antileukemic action by depleting NAD(+) and ATP, inhibiting the NAD(+)-requiring DNA damage repair enzyme PARP-1, increasing mitochondrial ROS levels and inducing DNA damage, culminating in apoptosis induction. OT-82 sensitivity was associated with the occurrence of mutations in major DNA damage response genes, while OT-82 resistance was characterized by high expression levels of CD38.

The mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of the T618I CSF3R and its signal propagation are poorly understood. Ligand-independent activation of the T618I CSF3R has previously been attributed to loss of receptor O-glycosylation and increased receptor dimerization. Here, we show that the T618I CSF3R is indeed glycosylated but undergoes enhanced spontaneous internalization and degradation that results in a marked decrease in its surface expression. Inhibition of the proteasome dramatically increases expression of the O-glycosylated T618I CSF3R. We also demonstrate that the O-glycosylated wild-type CSF3R is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to ligand but constitutively phosphorylated in cells expressing T618I CSF3R. Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the O-glycosylated T618I receptor form correlated with activation of JAK2 and both the mutant receptor and JAK2 were found to be constitutively ubiquitinated. These observations provide novel insights into the mechanisms of oncogenic signaling by T618I CSF3R mutations in CNL.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Many naturally occurring mutations in the POT1 gene have been found to be associated with cardiac angiosarcoma, glioma, familial melanoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In particular, Y89C is a naturally occurring mutation of POT1, responsible for familial melanoma, and the molecular basis of this mutation is unexplored. In this study, we have extensively analyzed the structure of WT and Y89C mutant of POT1 to see the change in the conformational dynamics, free energy landscape, molecular motions and configurational frustration using molecular dynamics (MD) and other bioinformatics approaches. Y89C mutation shows a significant change in the backbone orientation, compactness, residual fluctuation, solvent accessibility, and hydrogen bonding, suggesting an overall destabilization of the protein structure. Besides, essential dynamics, conformation, magnitude, direction of motion and frustration analysis further suggesting the structural loss in POT1 due to Y89C mutation. Free energy landscape analysis also indicates the presence of a single well-defined free-energy minima in case of WT compared to multiple wells defined free energy minima observed in Y89C, clearly suggesting that this mutation leads to reduce the stability of POT1. This study possibly provides a valuable path to understand the molecular basis of Y89C-mediated development of familial melanoma.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This leads to profound modifications of their metabolism, which further modifies their genetics and epigenetics as malignancy progresses. Specific metabolites and enzymes may serve as clinical markers of cancer progression. Recent Advances: Both 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) enantiomers are associated with reprogrammed metabolism, in grade III/IV glioma, glioblastoma, and acute myeloid leukemia cells, and numerous other cancer types, while acting also in the cross talk of tumors with immune cells. 2HG contributes to specific alternations in cancer metabolism and developed oxidative stress, while also inducing decisions on the differentiation of naive T lymphocytes, and serves as a signal messenger in immune cells. Moreover, 2HG inhibits chromatin-modifying enzymes, namely 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, and interferes with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcriptome reprogramming and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thus dysregulating gene expression and further promoting cancerogenesis. Critical Issues: Typically, heterozygous mutations within the active sites of isocitrate dehydrogenase isoform 1 (IDH1)(R132H) and mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase isoform 2 (IDH2)(R140Q) provide cells with millimolar r-2-hydroxyglutarate (r-2HG) concentrations, whereas side activities of lactate and malate dehydrogenase form submillimolar s-2-hydroxyglutarate (s-2HG).

We examined in this study the expression of ACE and ACE2 in thyroid tissues and their possible employment as biomarkers for thyroid cancer progression. Thyroid tissues, including 14 goiters (G), 12 follicular adenomas (FA), 10 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC), 14 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 11 undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas (UTC), were subjected to RT-PCR and protein analyses with primers or antibodies specific for ACE and ACE2, respectively. FA revealed significantly increased ACE compared to other groups and FTC was significantly higher than UTC. ACE2 was significantly increased in PTC in comparison to G, FA and UTC, and in FTC as compared to G. The ratio ACE/ACE2 decreased, while ACE2/ACE increased with the differentiation grade of thyroid carcinoma. ACE was significantly diminished in individuals older than 50. Both ACEs were significantly diminished in M1 patients, ACE2 additionally in higher tumor masses. ACE and ACE2 are regulated within thyroid benign and malignant tissues.

However, in parallel with the increase in survival rate, there is a greater occurrence of long-term toxicity related to antineoplastic treatment. Hypogonadism and infertility are among the most frequent endocrinological sequelae in young adult childhood cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to identify which category of patients, grouped according to diagnosis, therapy, and age at treatment, shows the worst reproductive function in adulthood. METHODS: We evaluated morpho-volumetric development of the testis, endocrine function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and sperm parameters in 102 young adult childhood cancer survivors. RESULTS: Overall, about one-third of patients showed low total testicular volume, total testosterone (TT) <3.5 ng/mL, and altered sperm count. Hodgkin's disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and non-cranial irradiation associated to chemotherapy were risk factors for poor gonadal function. Patients treated in pubertal age showed lower total testicular volume; however, the difference was due to more gonadotoxic treatment performed in older age. Testicular volume was more predictive of spermatogenesis than follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), while anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was not useful in the evaluation of testicular function of male childhood cancer survivors.

Taking advantage of these structural similarities and bio-derived strengths, the present study describes encapsulation of daunorubicin into lysosome derived from S. cerevisiae as drug delivery vehicles for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment. Daunorubicin is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer, specifically for AML. In this study, recombinant S. cerevisiae that could keep the small size of lysosomal vacuoles was constructed. Appropriate time and concentration to encapsulate the drug were then identified. In addition, release profile and anticancer effect of the drug in lysosome carriers were confirmed.

The role of microglia in CNS-GVHD remains undefined. In agreement with microglia activation, we found that profound morphological changes and MHC-II and CD80 upregulation occurred upon GVHD induction. RNA sequencing-based analysis of purified microglia obtained from mice with CNS-GVHD revealed TNF upregulation. Selective TNF gene deletion in microglia of Cx3cr1creER Tnffl/- mice reduced MHC-II expression and decreased CNS T cell infiltrates and VCAM-1+ endothelial cells. GVHD increased microglia TGF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) activation and NF-kappaB/p38 MAPK signaling. Selective Tak1 deletion in microglia using Cx3cr1creER Tak1fl/fl mice resulted in reduced TNF production and microglial MHC-II and improved neurocognitive activity. Pharmacological TAK1 inhibition reduced TNF production and MHC-II expression by microglia, Th1 and Th17 T cell infiltrates, and VCAM-1+ endothelial cells and improved neurocognitive activity, without blocking graft-versus-leukemia effects. Consistent with these findings in mice, we observed increased activation and TNF production of microglia in the CNS of GVHD patients.

However, European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) officially placed Triton X-100 on the Annex XIV authorization list in 2017 because 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenol, a degradation product of Triton X-100, is of harmful endocrine disrupting activities. As a result, any use of Triton X-100 in the European Economic Area would require an ECHA issued authorization after the sunset date of January 4, 2021. In search of possible replacements for Triton X-100, we discovered that polysorbate 80 (PS80) in absence of any solvents was able to effectively inactive enveloped viruses such as xenotropic murine leukemia virus and pseudorabies virus with comparable efficacy as measured by log reduction factors. Interestingly, PS80 did not show any virucidal activities in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) while achieving robust virus inactivation in cell-free Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) bioreactor harvests. This intriguing observation led us to speculate that virus inactivation by PS80 involved components in the cell-free CHO bioreactor harvests that were absent in PBS. Specifically, we hypothesized that esterase and/or lipases in the cell-free bioreactor harvests hydrolyzed PS80 to yield oleic acid, a known potent virucidal agent, which in turn inactivated viruses. This theory was confirmed using purified recombinant lysosomal phospholipase A2 isomer (rLPLA2) in PBS. Subsequent characterization work has indicated that virus inactivation by PS80 is effective and robust within temperature and concentration ranges comparable to those of Triton X-100. Similar to Triton X-100, virus inactivation by PS80 is dually dependent on treatment time and temperature. Unlike Triton X-100, PS80 inactivation does not correlate with concentrations in a simple manner. Additionally, we have demonstrated that PS20 exhibits similar virus inactivation activities as PS80. Based on the findings described in the current work, we believe that PS80 is potentially a viable replacement for Triton X-100 and can be used in manufacturing processes for wide spectrum of biopharmaceuticals to achieve desirable virus clearance. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using PS80 for virus inactivation are discussed in the contexts of GMP manufacturing.",['(c) 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.'],"['Chen, Dayue', 'Luo, Wen', 'Hoffman, Jacob', 'Huang, Lihua', 'Sandefur, Stephanie', 'Hall, Troii', 'Murphy, Marie', ""O'Donnell, Sean""]","['Chen D', 'Luo W', 'Hoffman J', 'Huang L', 'Sandefur S', 'Hall T', 'Murphy M', ""O'Donnell S""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9381-4040', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4500-6943']","['Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Bioproduct Research and Development, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191227,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '0 (Solvents)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', '*Cell-Free System', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Detergents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Octoxynol', 'Polysorbates/*pharmacology', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Virus Inactivation/*drug effects']",,,,,2019/12/18 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/btpr.2953 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2020 May;36(3):e2953. doi: 10.1002/btpr.2953.

Despite a few recurrent genetic defects (eg, single nucleotide changes, indels, large chromosomal aberrations) have been identified in BPDCN, none are disease-specific, and more importantly, none explain its genesis or clinical behavior. In this study, we performed the first high resolution whole-genome analysis of BPDCN with a special focus on structural genomic alterations by using whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. Our study, the first to characterize the landscape of genomic rearrangements and copy number alterations of BPDCN at nucleotide-level resolution, revealed that IKZF1, a gene encoding a transcription factor required for the differentiation of plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors, is focally inactivated through recurrent structural alterations in this neoplasm. In concordance with the genomic data, transcriptome analysis revealed that conserved IKZF1 target genes display a loss-of-IKZF1 expression pattern. Furthermore, up-regulation of cellular processes responsible for cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, which is a hallmark of IKZF1 deficiency, was prominent in BPDCN. Our findings suggest that IKZF1 inactivation plays a central role in the pathobiology of the disease, and consequently, therapeutic approaches directed at reestablishing the function of this gene might be beneficial for patients.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Noncoding regulatory mutations such as those on the core promoter of the gene encoding human telomerase reverse transcriptase have been shown to affect gene expression in cancer. Using a protein microarray of 667 transcription factor DNA-binding domains and subsequent functional assays, we looked for transcription factors that preferentially bind the mutant hTERT promoter and characterized their downstream effects. One of them, friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1), which belongs to the E26 transforming-specific family of transcription factors, exhibited particularly strong effects with respect to regulating hTERT expression, while the even better binding ELK3 did not. Depletion of FLI1 decreased expression of the genes for cyclin D1 (CCND1) and E2F transcription factor 2 (E2F2) resulting in a G1/S cell cycle arrest and in consequence a reduction of cell proliferation. FLI1 also affected CMTM7, another gene involved in G1/S transition, although by another process that suggests a balanced regulation of the tumor suppressor gene's activity via opposing regulation processes. FLI1 expression was found upregulated and correlated with an increase in CCND1 expression in pancreatic cancer and brain tumors. In non-neoplastic lung cells, however, FLI1 depletion led to rapid progression through the cell cycle. This coincides with the fact that FLI1 is downregulated in lung tumors. Taken together, our data indicate a cell cycle regulatory hub involving FLI1, hTERT, CCND1 and E2F2 in a tissue- and context-dependent manner.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Dectin-1 (rs16910526, rs3901533, and rs7309123), TLR2 (rs5743708), TLR4 (rs4986790 and rs4986791) and MyD88 (rs4988453 and rs4988457) in the genomic DNA of 172 adult AML patients were genotyped. Pulmonary IFD was diagnosed as proven or probable according to the 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) consensus guidelines. SNPs that were significant in the univariate analysis were further analyzed using the multiple logistic regression analysis to determine their association with the occurrence of pulmonary IFD. The mRNA expression of Dectin-1 was detected according to the genotype by quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR), and the correlation of this expression with the occurrence of pulmonary IFD in AML patients was analyzed. Two Dectin-1 intron SNPs (rs3901533 and rs7309123) were found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to pulmonary IFD in AML patients in a Chinese Han population. Significant associations were noted between pulmonary IFD and Dectin-1 rs3901533 dominant model (G/T+G/G vs. T/T, OR: 2.158; 95% CI: 1.109-4.2, P=0.02), Dectin-1 rs3901533 G allele (OR: 2.201; 95% CI: 1.206-4.019, P=0.01), or Dectin-1 rs7309123 C allele (OR: 1.919; 95% CI: 1.047-3.518, P=0.03). There were no significant associations between pulmonary IFD and the remaining Dectin-1 SNPs (rs16910526), TLR2 (rs5743708), TLR4 (rs4986790 and rs4986791) or MyD88 (rs4988453 and rs4988457).

At our institution, UCB was the main alternative donor type until 2013, when HaploHCT was introduced as the preferred procedure. A common myeloablative conditioning regimen was used, based on thiotepa, busulfan, and fludarabine. We analyze the outcomes of 47 patients (61%) who received a single UCB transplantation (UCBT) and 30 patients (39%) who received a HaploHCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. No differences were found in the rate of neutrophil engraftment, whereas platelet recovery was earlier with HaploHCT. NRM was higher after UCBT at 3 months and 3 years (13% and 13% vs. 23% and 45% in HaploHCT and UCBT, respectively; p < 0.001 for both time points). The 3-year relapse incidence was 35% after HaploHCT vs. 17% after UCBT, respectively (p = 0.13). The 100-day incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (3% vs. 11%) and the 3-year moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD (4% vs. 15%) did not differ between HaploHCT and UCBT, respectively (p > 0.2). There was a trend for higher overall survival at 1 and 3 years in HaploHCT recipients (69% vs. 45% and 64% vs. 38%, respectively; p = 0.055 for both time points). Despite the small sample sizes, multivariate analysis adjusted for patient age and disease status at transplant showed a better 3-year OS in HaploHCT recipients, mostly due to a lower NRM (p < 0.001).

MiR-663b has been found to have important roles in several cancers, however, the role of miR-663b in T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) remains unclear. Therefore, we speculated that miR-663b might also play a crucial role in the development and process of T-ALL. In the present study, we found that miR-663b was up-regulated in the blood of children with T-ALL and T-ALL cell lines. TargetScan and dual luciferase reporter assay results showed that CD99 was a direct target of miR-663b. In order to further study the biological function of miR-663b in the development of T-ALL and to clarify its potential molecular mechanism, we detected the changes in proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of T-ALL cell line Jurkat before and after miR-663b inhibitor transfection. We found that miR-663b inhibitor inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In addition, miR-663b inhibitor repressed Jurkat cell migration and invasion. All these effects of miR-663b inhibitor on Jurkat cells were eliminated by CD99-silencing. These results have provided a new theoretical basis and strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of T-ALL.","['(c) 2019 Xuehua Liu et al., published by De Gruyter.']","['Liu, Xuehua', 'Zhang, Haixia', 'Zhang, Baorong', 'Zhang, Xiaohong']","['Liu X', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang B', 'Zhang X']",,"['Pediatric blood and endocrine metabolism nursing platform, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Pediatric blood and endocrine metabolism nursing platform, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'PICU nursing platform, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of neurotrauma surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, No. 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun 130021, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191117,Poland,Open Med (Wars),"Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)",101672167,,,,PMC6884921,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Biological functions', 'CD99', 'Jurkat cells', 'miR-663b']",2019/12/18 06:00,2019/12/18 06:01,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/med-2019-0101 [doi]', 'med-2019-0101 [pii]']",epublish,Open Med (Wars). 2019 Nov 17;14:863-871. doi: 10.1515/med-2019-0101. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: We aimed to determine the significance of MRD at the end of remission induction therapy in the prediction of treatment outcome in children with ALL. METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive patients aged 1-14 years with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled in this study from January 2010 to October 2017. All patients were treated according to the ALL IC BFM 2002 protocol. MRD was detected at the end of remission induction therapy (day 33) by multiparameter 6-colour flow cytometry performed on bone marrow specimens with a sensitivity of 0.01%. RESULTS: Overall, 42.2% of patients had detectable MRD on day 33 of therapy. MRD measurements were not significantly related to presenting characteristics but were associated with a poorer blast clearance on day 8 and 15 of remission induction therapy. Patients with negative MRD status on day 33 had a 5-year event-free survival of 94.6% compared with 76.1% for those with positive MRD status (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: MRD levels at the end of remission induction therapy measured by multiparameter flow cytometry have clinical significance in childhood ALL. High levels of MRD are strongly related to poor treatment outcome.","['Copyright: (c) 2019 Aleksandra Jovanovska, Kata Martinova, Svetlana Kocheva,', 'Zorica Trajkova-Antevska, Biljana Coneska-Jovanova, Irina Panovska-Stavridis,', 'Svetlana Stankovikj, Sanja Trajkova, Aleksandar Dimovski.']","['Jovanovska, Aleksandra', 'Martinova, Kata', 'Kocheva, Svetlana', 'Trajkova-Antevska, Zorica', 'Coneska-Jovanova, Biljana', 'Panovska-Stavridis, Irina', 'Stankovikj, Svetlana', 'Trajkova, Sanja', 'Dimovski, Aleksandar']","['Jovanovska A', 'Martinova K', 'Kocheva S', 'Trajkova-Antevska Z', 'Coneska-Jovanova B', 'Panovska-Stavridis I', 'Stankovikj S', 'Trajkova S', 'Dimovski A']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children`s Diseases, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children`s Diseases, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children`s Diseases, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children`s Diseases, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Clinical Hospital Acibadem Sistina, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'University Clinic for Hematology, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'University Clinic for Hematology, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'University Clinic for Hematology, Medical Faculty, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Skopje, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190914,North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,PMC6901875,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Children', 'Minimal residual disease']",2019/12/18 06:00,2019/12/18 06:01,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2019.752 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-7-2818 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2019 Sep 14;7(17):2818-2823. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2019.752. eCollection 2019 Sep 15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some miRNAs, including the recently discovered miR-582-3p, have been implicated in leukemogenesis. This study aimed to reveal the biological function of miR-582-3p in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is one of the most frequently diagnosed hematological malignancies. Methods: The expression of miR-582-3p was determined using quantitative real-time PCR in blood samples from leukemia patients and in cell lines. Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were analyzed using the CCK-8, colony formation and flow cytometry assays. The target gene of miR-582-3p was verified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The G2/M phase arrest-related molecule contents were measured using western blotting analysis. Results: We found miR-582-3p was significantly downregulated in the blood samples from leukemia patients and in the cell lines. MiR-582-3p overexpression significantly impaired cell proliferation and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, cyclin B2 (CCNB2) was confirmed as a target gene of miR-582-3p and found to be negatively regulated by miR-582-3p overexpression. More importantly, CCNB2 knockdown showed suppressive effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression similar to those caused by miR-582-3p overexpression. The inhibitory effects of miR-582-3p overexpression on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were abrogated by CCNB2 transfection. Conclusion: These findings indicate new functions and mechanisms for miR-582-3p in AML development. Further study could clarify if miR-582-3p and CCNB2 are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of AML.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],"['Li, Haixia', 'Tian, Xuefei', 'Wang, Paoqiu', 'Huang, Mao', 'Xu, Ronghua', 'Nie, Tian']","['Li H', 'Tian X', 'Wang P', 'Huang M', 'Xu R', 'Nie T']",,"[""1Department of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Hunan Children's Hospital, Changsha, 410007 China.grid.440223.3"", '2Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208 China.0000 0004 1765 5169grid.488482.a', '3College of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208 China.0000 0004 1765 5169grid.488482.a', ""1Department of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Hunan Children's Hospital, Changsha, 410007 China.grid.440223.3"", '4Department of Pediatric Rehabilitation, Hebei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050000 Hebei China.grid.470210.0', '5Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, 95 Shaoshan Middle Road, Changsha City, 410007 Hunan Province China.0000 0004 1765 5169grid.488482.a', '5Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, 95 Shaoshan Middle Road, Changsha City, 410007 Hunan Province China.0000 0004 1765 5169grid.488482.a']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191204,England,Cell Mol Biol Lett,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,"['0 (CCNB2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B2)', '0 (MIRN582 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Cyclin B2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells']",PMC6894134,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CCNB2', 'Cell cycle', 'miR-582-3p']",2019/12/18 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s11658-019-0184-7 [doi]', '184 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Mol Biol Lett. 2019 Dec 4;24:66. doi: 10.1186/s11658-019-0184-7. eCollection 2019.,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How chromatin is reconfigured during this developmental window remains poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide investigation of chromatin landscapes during this period. We find that enhancers in ectoderm are already pre-accessible in embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) Epi when cells enter a primed pluripotent state. Unexpectedly, strong trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) emerges at developmental gene promoters in E6.5 Epi and positively correlates with H3K27me3, thus establishing bivalency. These genes also show enhanced spatial interactions. Both the strong bivalency and spatial clustering are virtually absent in preimplantation embryos and are markedly reduced in fate-committed lineages. Finally, we show that KMT2B is essential for establishing bivalent H3K4me3 at E6.5 but becomes partially dispensable later. Its deficiency leads to impaired activation of developmental genes and subsequent embryonic lethality. Thus, our data characterize lineage-specific chromatin reconfiguration and a unique chromatin state for primed pluripotency.",,"['Xiang, Yunlong', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Xu, Qianhua', 'Zhou, Chen', 'Liu,

The genetic basis underlying MHG-DLBCL and their aggressive clinical behaviour remain unknown. We investigated 697 cases of DLBCL, particularly those with MYC/BCL2-DH (n = 62) by targeted sequencing and gene expression profiling. We showed that DLBCL with MYC/BCL2-DH, and those with BCL2 translocation, harbour the characteristic mutation signatures that are associated with follicular lymphoma and its high-grade transformation. We identified frequent MYC hotspot mutations that affect the phosphorylation site (T58) and its adjacent amino acids, which are important for MYC protein degradation. These MYC mutations were seen in a subset of cases with MYC translocation, but predominantly in those of MHG. The mutations were more frequent in double-hit lymphomas with IG as the MYC translocation partner, and were associated with higher MYC protein expression and poor patient survival.

Both IBD and SCL in cats share features with chronic enteropathies such as IBD and monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma in humans. The aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbiome of 38 healthy cats and 27 cats with CE (13 cats with IBD and 14 cats with SCL). Alpha diversity indices were significantly decreased in cats with CE (OTU p = 0.003, Shannon Index p = 0.008, Phylogenetic Diversity p = 0.019). ANOSIM showed a significant difference in bacterial communities, albeit with a small effect size (P = 0.023, R = 0.073). Univariate analysis and LEfSE showed a lower abundance of facultative anaerobic taxa of the phyla Firmicutes (families Ruminococcaceae and Turicibacteraceae), Actinobacteria (genus Bifidobacterium) and Bacteroidetes (i.a. Bacteroides plebeius) in cats with CE. The facultative anaerobic taxa Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae were increased in cats with CE.

Herein, our study was performed to evaluate the effect of exosomal miR-4532 secreted by AML cells on hematopoiesis of hematopoietic stem cells. METHODS: Firstly, differentially expressed miRs related to AML were identified using microarray analysis. Subsequently, AML cell lines were collected, and CD34(+) HSCs were isolated from healthy pregnant women. Then, miR-4532 expression was measured in AML cells and AML cell-derived exosomes and CD34(+) HSCs, together with evaluation of the targeting relationship between miR-4532 and LDOC1. Then, AML cells were treated with miR-4532 inhibitor, and exosomes were separated from AML cells and co-cultured with CD34(+) HSCs. Gain- and loss-function approaches were employed in CD34(+) HSCs. Colony-forming units (CFU) and expression of dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a hematopoietic inhibiting factor associated with pathogenesis of AML, were determined in CD34(+) HSCs, as well as the extents of JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation and LDOC1 expression. RESULTS: miR-4532 was found to be upregulated in AML cells and AML cell-derived exosomes, while being downregulated in CD34(+) HSCs. In addition, exosomes released by AML cells targeted CD34(+) HSCs to decrease the expression of CFU and increase the expression of DKK1. miR-4532 was delivered into CD34(+) HSCs to target LDOC1 via AML cell-released exosomes. AML cell-derived exosomes containing miR-4532 inhibitor increased CFU but reduced DKK1 in CD34(+) HSCs.

METHODS: In this study, we used a green fluorescent protein mouse xenograft model of B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. We isolated and purified SSCs from the testicular tissue of model mice using density gradient centrifugation, immune cell magnetic bead separation, and flow cytometry. The purified SSCs were transplanted into convoluted seminiferous tubules of the nude mice and C57BL/6 male mice subjected to busulfan. The development and proliferation of SSCs in the recipient testis were periodically tested, along with whether B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia was induced following SSC implantation. The genetic characteristics of the offspring obtained from natural mating were also observed. RESULTS: In testicular leukemia model mice, a large number of BALL cells infiltrated into the seminiferous tubule, spermatogenic cells, and sperm cells in the testis tissue decreased. After spermatogonial stem cell transplantation, the transplanted SSCs purified by immunomagnetic beads and flow cytometry methods colonized and proliferated extensively in the basement of the seminiferous tubules of mice; a large number of spermatogenic cells and sperm were found in recipient testicular tissue after 12 weeks of SSC transplantation. In leukemia detection in nude mice after transplantation in the three SSC purification groups, a large number of BALL cells could be detected in the blood of recipient mice 2-3 weeks after transplantation in the density gradient centrifugation group, but not in the blood of the flow cytometry sorting group and the immunomagnetic bead group after 16 weeks of observation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we confirmed that immunomagnetic beads and flow cytometry methods of purifying SSCs from the testicular tissue of the testicular leukemia mouse model could be safely applied to the SSC transplantation technology without concomitant tumor implantation. The results thus provide a theoretical basis for the application of tumor SSC cryopreservation for fertility preservation in patients with tumors.",,"['Tian, Jia', 'Ma, Ke', 'Pei, Cheng-Bin', 'Zhang, Shao-Hua', 'Li, Xue', 'Zhou, Yue', 'Yan, Bei', 'Wang, Hong-Yan', 'Ma, Liang-Hong']","['Tian J', 'Ma K', 'Pei CB', 'Zhang SH', 'Li X', 'Zhou Y', 'Yan B', 'Wang HY', 'Ma LH']",,"['General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University/Human Sperm Bank of Ningxia, Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'Clinical College, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University/Human Sperm Bank of Ningxia, Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'Clinical College, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University/Human Sperm Bank of Ningxia, Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University/Human Sperm Bank of Ningxia, Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University/Human Sperm Bank of Ningxia, Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China.', 'General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University/Human Sperm Bank of Ningxia, Key Laboratory of Fertility Preservation and Maintenance of Ministry of Education, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, China. mmm1770@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191216,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Spermatogenesis/*genetics', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6916234,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Density gradient centrifugation', '*Fertility preservation', '*Flow cytometry', '*Immunomagnetic bead separation', '*Spermatogonial stem cell', '*Tumor']",2019/12/18 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-019-1481-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-019-1481-9 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2019 Dec 16;10(1):382. doi: 10.1186/s13287-019-1481-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to another human retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HTLV-1 persists in the host not via vigorous virus production but mainly via proliferation and/or long-term survival in the form of silent proviruses in infected host cells. As a result, HTLV-1-infected cells rarely produce virus particles in vivo even without anti-retroviral treatment. That should be an advantage for the virus to escape from the host immune surveillance by minimizing the expression of viral antigens in host cells. However, why HIV-1 and HTLV-1 behave so differently during natural infection is not fully understood. RESULTS: We performed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) using total RNAs and nascent, chromatin-associated, RNAs in the nucleus and found that HTLV-1 RNAs were processed post-transcriptionally in infected cells. RNA processing was evident for the sense viral transcripts but not the anti-sense ones. We also found a higher proportion of CG di-nucleotides in proviral sequences of HTLV-1-infected cells, when compared to the HIV-1 genomic sequence. It has been reported recently that CG dinucleotide content of viral sequence is associated with susceptibility to the antiviral ZC3HAV1 (ZAP), suggesting the involvement of this protein in the regulation of HTLV-1 transcripts. To analyse the effect of ZAP on HTLV-1 transcripts, we over-expressed it in HTLV-1-infected cells. We found there was a dose-dependent reduction in virus production with ZAP expression. We further knocked down endogenous ZAP with two independent targeting siRNAs and observed a significant increase in virus production in the culture supernatant. Other delta-type retroviruses such as simian T-cell leukaemia virus and bovine leukaemia virus, also contain high CG-dinucleotide contents in their viral genomes, suggesting that ZAP-mediated suppression of viral transcripts might be a common feature of delta-type retroviruses, which cause minimal viremia in their natural hosts. CONCLUSIONS: The post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving ZAP might allow HTLV-1 to maintain a delicate balance required for prolonged survival in infected individuals.",,"['Miyazato, Paola', 'Matsuo, Misaki', 'Tan, Benjy J Y', 'Tokunaga, Michiyo', 'Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Islam, Saiful', 'Ito, Jumpei', 'Murakawa, Yasuhiro', 'Satou, Yorifumi']","['Miyazato P', 'Matsuo M', 'Tan BJY', 'Tokunaga M', 'Katsuya H', 'Islam S', 'Ito J', 'Murakawa Y', 'Satou Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1495-7810'],"['Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Systems Virology, Department of Infectious Disease Control, International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'RIKEN-IFOM Joint Laboratory for Cancer Genomics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Genomics and Transcriptomics, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-0811, Japan. y-satou@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. y-satou@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191216,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ZC3HAV1 protein, human)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology']",PMC6915898,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*HTLV-1', '*Post-transcriptional regulation', '*Retroviral latency', '*Retrovirus', '*ZAP']",2019/12/18 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0500-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0500-3 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Dec 16;16(1):38. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0500-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bovine major histocompatibility complex class II region plays a key role in the subclinical progression of BLV infection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the roles of CD4(+) T-cell epitopes in disease progression in cattle. METHODS: We examined five Japanese Black cattle, including three disease-susceptible animals, one disease-resistant animal, and one normal animal, classified according to genotyping of bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 and BoLA-DQA1 alleles using polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing methods. All cattle were inoculated with BLV-infected blood collected from BLV experimentally infected cattle and then subjected to CD4(+) T-cell epitope mapping by cell proliferation assays. RESULTS: Five Japanese Black cattle were successfully infected with BLV, and CD4(+) T-cell epitope mapping was then conducted. Disease-resistant and normal cattle showed low and moderate proviral loads and harbored six or five types of CD4(+) T-cell epitopes, respectively. In contrast, the one of three disease-susceptible cattle with the highest proviral load did not harbor CD4(+) T-cell epitopes, and two of three other cattle with high proviral loads each had only one epitope. Thus, the CD4(+) T-cell epitope repertoire was less frequent in disease-susceptible cattle than in other cattle. CONCLUSION: Although only a few cattle were included in this study, our results showed that CD4(+) T-cell epitopes may be associated with BoLA-DRB3-DQA1 haplotypes, which conferred differential susceptibilities to BLV proviral loads. These CD4(+) T-cell epitopes could be useful for the design of anti-BLV vaccines targeting disease-susceptible Japanese Black cattle. Further studies of CD4(+) T-cell epitopes in other breeds and using larger numbers of cattle with differential susceptibilities are required to confirm these findings.",,"['Bai, Lanlan', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Sato, Masaaki', 'Davis, William C', 'Wada, Satoshi', 'Kohara, Junko', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Bai L', 'Takeshima SN', 'Sato M', 'Davis WC', 'Wada S', 'Kohara J', 'Aida Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7400-3587'],"['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. takesima@jumonji-u.ac.jp.', 'Faculty of Human Life, Department of Food and Nutrition, Jumonji University, 2-1-28 Sugasawa, Niiza, Saitama, 352-0017, Japan. takesima@jumonji-u.ac.jp.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Monoclonal antibody center, Department of Veterinary Microbiology & Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-7040, USA.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Animal Research Center, Hokkaido Research Organization, 5-39-1 Shintoku, Hokkaido, 081-0038, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191216,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/*virology', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Japan', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology']",PMC6916044,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Bovine leukocyte antigen class II', '*CD4+ T-cell epitope mapping', '*Disease susceptibility', '*Proviral load']",2019/12/18 06:00,2020/04/29 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-019-1259-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-019-1259-9 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2019 Dec 16;16(1):157. doi: 10.1186/s12985-019-1259-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 exhibits a remarkable genetic stability, however, viral strains have been classified in several genotypes and subgroups, which often mirror the geographic origin of the viral strain. The Cosmopolitan genotype HTLV-1a, can be subdivided into geographically related subgroups, e.g. Transcontinental (a-TC), Japanese (a-Jpn), West-African (a-WA), North-African (a-NA), and Senegalese (a-Sen). Within each subgroup, the genetic diversity is low. Genotype HTLV-1b is found in Central Africa; it is the major genotype in Gabon, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo. While strains from the HTLV-1d genotype represent only a few percent of the strains present in Central African countries, genotypes -e, -f, and -g have been only reported sporadically in particular in Cameroon Gabon, and Central African Republic. HTLV-1c genotype, which is found exclusively in Australo-Melanesia, is the most divergent genotype. This reflects an ancient speciation, with a long period of isolation of the infected populations in the different islands of this region (Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu archipelago). Until now, no viral genotype or subgroup is associated with a specific HTLV-1-associated disease. HTLV-1 originates from a simian reservoir (STLV-1); it derives from interspecies zoonotic transmission from non-human primates to humans (ancient or recent). In this review, we describe the genetic diversity of HTLV-1, and analyze the molecular mechanisms that are at play in HTLV-1 evolution. Similar to other retroviruses, HTLV-1 evolves either through accumulation of point mutations or recombination. Molecular studies point to a fairly low evolution rate of HTLV-1 (between 5.6E-7 and 1.5E-6 substitutions/site/year), supposedly because the virus persists within the host via clonal expansion (instead of new infectious cycles that use reverse transcriptase).",,"['Afonso, Philippe V', 'Cassar, Olivier', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Afonso PV', 'Cassar O', 'Gessain A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4828-3797'],"[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, CRNS-UMR 3569, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, Batiment Lwoff, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, 75724, Paris cedex 15, France. philippe.afonso@pasteur.fr."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, CRNS-UMR 3569, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, Batiment Lwoff, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, 75724, Paris cedex 15, France."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, CRNS-UMR 3569, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, Batiment Lwoff, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, 75724, Paris cedex 15, France. antoine.gessain@pasteur.fr.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191216,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Africa/epidemiology', 'Animals', '*Evolution, Molecular', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Primates/virology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics']",PMC6916231,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Africa', '*Evolution', '*Genotypes', '*HTLV-1', '*Molecular epidemiology', '*Mutation rate']",2019/12/18 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0504-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0504-z [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Dec 16;16(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0504-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current CLL xenograft models are hampered by inefficient engraftment of good prognostic CLLs, overgrowth with co-transplanted T cells, and the need for allogeneic humanization or irradiation. Therefore, we aimed to establish an effective and reproducible xenograft protocol which allows engraftment of all CLL subtypes without the need of humanization or irradiation. Unmanipulated NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Sug)/JicTac (NOG) mice in contrast to C.Cg-Rag2(tm1Fwa-/-)Il2rg(tm1Sug)/JicTac (BRG) mice allowed engraftment of all tested CLL subgroups with 100% success rate, if CLL cells were fresh, injected simultaneously intra-peritoneally and intravenously, and co-transferred with low fractions of autologous T cells (2%-4%). CLL transplanted NOG mice (24 different patients) developed CLL pseudofollicles in the spleen, which increased over 4-6 weeks, and were then limited by the expanding autologous T cells. Ibrutinib treatment studies were performed to validate our model, and recapitulated treatment responses seen in patients. In conclusion, we developed an easy-to-use CLL xenograft protocol which allows reliable engraftment for all CLL subgroups without humanization or irradiation of mice. This protocol can be widely used to study CLL biology and to explore novel drug candidates.",,"['Decker, Sarah', 'Zwick, Anabel', 'Khaja Saleem, Shifa', 'Kissel, Sandra', 'Rettig, Andres', 'Aumann, Konrad', 'Dierks, Christine']","['Decker S', 'Zwick A', 'Khaja Saleem S', 'Kissel S', 'Rettig A', 'Aumann K', 'Dierks C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8178-1571'],"['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, Saarland University, 66421 Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'BIOSS Centre for Biological Signaling Studies, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Clinical Nutrition, University Hospital, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['111025/Deutsche Krebshilfe', '70112614/Deutsche Krebshilfe', 'DI 1664/1-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'DI 1664/2-2/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'DI 1664/3-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'DJCLS F15/3/Jose Carreras Leukamie-Stiftung']",['Journal Article'],20191212,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC6940872,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'microenvironment', 'xenograft']",2019/12/18 06:00,2020/05/01 06:00,['2019/12/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20246277 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20246277 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 12;20(24). pii: ijms20246277. doi: 10.3390/ijms20246277.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed to clarify the critical period of growth in pediatric patients who were treated by the Japan Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS) ALL-02 protocol, which involved short-term intensive treatment without CRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, cohort study was conducted for prepubertal children with B-precursor ALL who were diagnosed from July 2002 to November 2011 and treated by the JACLS ALL-02 protocol at Oita University Hospital. The heights were chronologically measured at pretreatment, after the intensive phase (INT), at the end of treatment (END), and at 1 to 5 year(s) posttreatment (POST 1 to 5). RESULTS: Nine boys and 4 girls were enrolled. Z score of the height was reduced at INT and END. Delta Z scores of the height and Z score of height velocity were reduced from pretreatment to INT, and they demonstrated an early recovery during maintenance treatment in INT to END. CONCLUSIONS: Early recovery of delta Z scores of the height and Z score of height velocity was observed during the INT to END period.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of cancer on young adults' evolving sense of self and identity over one year from the time of diagnosis. In addition, to contribute further to an understanding of innovative research methods used to examine this experience. DESIGN: This was a longitudinal narrative study using visual methods and a psychosocial lens. Narrative was used to re-present experiences over time. SETTING AND SAMPLE: Recruitment was from a Principal Treatment Centre for Teenagers and Young Adults with Cancer and a Cancer Centre for Adults in the United Kingdom. Total population sampling was used over a six-month period, recruiting 18 young adults aged between 16 and 30, one to three months from a diagnosis of bone cancer, lymphoma or leukaemia. METHODS: In depth, free association narrative interviews at three-time points over a year were undertaken. Photographs were used to help with story-telling. Extensive reflexive field notes, debriefing and the use of a psychosocial research group, also formed data sources. Forty interviews were conducted with 18 participants: eight took part in three interviews, six in two interviews and four in one interview. Analysis focused on the holistic 'case' of the individual temporally. In-depth, visual images were analysed from discussion in the narrative text. Through memoing, coding and comparison, themes were developed across all cases and a conceptual framework developed. RESULTS: The conceptual framework illustrates the renegotiation of self over time through narrative. This was 'biographically' during young adult development and across 'cancer time'; through the core components of: the inner world, (psyche, emotion and coping); self as embodied; self as relating to others, and self as relating to place. Stories indicated that there was a constant inter- relationship over time between the renegotiation of identity and adaption of biography. CONCLUSIONS: The focus in this paper is on 'the temporality of cancer' through the first year from diagnosis, and the juxtaposed process of managing biographical and developmental milestones. The importance of developing health care and research which enables narrative and the patient's voice has been highlighted. It emphasises the need for professionals to 'be with' and 'walk alongside' through the intensity of a biographically and identity changing illness. Using longitudinal narrative, visual & psychosocial methods to describe the impact of a diagnosis of cancer on young adults' sense of biography and identity.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Here, we demonstrate how somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be used to longitudinally track the dynamic output of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in humans. Over the course of 3 years of blood sampling in a single individual, our analyses reveal somatic mtDNA sequence variation and evolution reminiscent of models of hematopoiesis established by genetic labeling approaches.

From a phase 1 study of 258 patients with IDH1-mutant hematologic malignancies, we report results for 34 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for standard therapy who received 500 mg ivosidenib daily. Median age was 76.5 years, 26 patients (76%) had secondary AML, and 16 (47%) had received >/=1 hypomethylating agent for an antecedent hematologic disorder. The most common all-grade adverse events were diarrhea (n = 18; 53%), fatigue (n = 16; 47%), nausea (n = 13; 38%), and decreased appetite (n = 12; 35%). Differentiation syndrome was reported in 6 patients (18%) (grade >/=3 in 3 [9%]) and did not require treatment discontinuation. Complete remission (CR) plus CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) rate was 42.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5% to 60.8%); CR 30.3% (95% CI, 15.6% to 48.7%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ALL patients (n = 34) were examined within 5 stages of a program chemotherapy. The clinical symptoms, hemogram and myelogram data were analyzed. The radiation dose on bone marrow, initial leuko- cyte count, variants and prognosis of ALL course were accounted. Days of the stopped chemotherapy, type and fre- quency of complications (septic processes, febrile neutropenia, toxic hepatitis, granulocytopenia degree), and the prognosis of disease course (child living status, i.e. alive or died) were estimated. RESULTS: There were abnormal differentiation processes and high percentage of lymphoblasts (86.2 +/- 3.3) % in bone marrow in the 1st acute period. Hematological remission was established in all patients on the 33rd day of chemothe- rapy. In a half of cases the haematopoietic recovery occurred by a granulocyte-monocyte type. One third of patients presenting an erythroid type of haemopoiesis died later. The inverse correlation was found between the number of myelocaryocytes and disease prognosis (rs = -0.49). Breaks in chemotherapy for various reasons were recorded. The number of patients with granulocytopenia was greater at the phase 1 and 2 of protocol I and protocol M application, coinciding with a higher incidence of complications. An inverse correlations between the prediction of ALL course and sum of days of breaks between the protocol M and phase 1 of protocol II (rs = -0.56), as well as the duration of the phase 2 of protocol II (rs = -0.62) were found. The radiation dose on bone marrow was (5.37 +/- 1.23) mSv. No relationship was found between the radiation doses, ALL variants and disease course. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis of ALL course in children depends on the type of haemopoietic recovery and reasons of breaks in a standard chemotherapy. Interaction between the haemopoiesis functioning and microenvironment and that of their regulation are the key mechanisms of above-mentioned abnormalities, which is the basis for further research.","['V.

The his- tory of studies of this phenomenon is presented - it described under various names since 1905, began to study from the end of the twentieth century when named as RIBE and caused particular interest in the scientific community during recent decades. It is shown that the development of biological science and the improvement of research methods allowed to get new in-depth data on the development of RIBE not only at the level of the whole organism, but even at the genome level. The review highlights the key points of numerous RIBE investigations including mod- eling; methodological approaches to studying; classification; features of interaction between irradiated and intact cells; the role of the immune system, oxidative stress, cytogenetic disorders, changes in gene expression in the mechanism of development of RIBE; rescue effect, abscopal effect, persistence, modification, medical effects. It is emphasized that despite the considerable amount of research concerning the bystander response as the universal phenomenon and RIBE as one of its manifestations, there are still enough <<white spots>> in determining the mech- anisms of the RIBE formation and assessing the possible consequences of its development for human health.","['O.

Two main factors explain this situation. On the one hand, the reliability of the basophil count is insufficient, whether it is performed by a microscopic slide examination or by a hematology analyser. On the other hand, our knowledge of conditions associated with basophilia is largely based on few case reports and on reviews that refer to older reviews. The association between basophilia and myeloid neoplasm, especially chronic myeloid neoplasm, is well established. Conversely, there are conflicting data on some benign medical conditions and it remains unclear where basophilia may be present. In this review, we have investigated the medical literature to define which medical conditions can lead to basophilia and which cannot, and we propose a practical approach to manage basophilia divided into 3 steps. First, we have to check the real existence of the basophilia by getting rid of spurious basophilia. Then, we have to look for symptoms that suggest reactive basophilia and for clue of a neoplastic cause. Finally, in case of suspicion of a myeloid neoplasm or persistence of the basophilia in the absence of a reactive cause, we have to decide which examinations need to be prescribed to confirm a neoplastic basophilia.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Feriel, Joffrey', 'Depasse, Francois', 'Genevieve, Franck']","['Feriel J', 'Depasse F', 'Genevieve F']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5820-3279'],"['Clinical Development, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres sur Seine, France.', 'Clinical Development, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres sur Seine, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital, Angers, France.', ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), Angers, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191216,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['*Basophils/metabolism/pathology', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['atopy', 'basophilia', 'blood smear', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'flow cytometry', 'pseudobasophilia']",2019/12/17 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13146 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Jun;42(3):237-245. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13146.

Persistent peripheral blood monocytosis of at least 1 x 10(9) /L and a percentage of monocytes >/=10% of the circulating white blood cell count (WBC) are both prerequisite criteria for this diagnosis. CMML represents the prototype of ""overlapping"" myeloid neoplasms with concurrent myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic features. However, clinical presentation is heterogeneous, with cases showing prevailing ""dysplastic"" features and others a predominant ""proliferative"" phenotype. Accounting for this diversity, two variants of CMML are recognized: ""dysplastic"" CMML defined by WBC < 13 x 10(9) /L and ""proliferative"" CMML with WBC >/= 13 x 10(9) /L often showing features mimicking a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Although not an official WHO category, the ""oligomonocytic"" variant of CMML is defined by relative monocytosis with an absolute monocyte count of 0.5-0.9 x 10(9) /L. It can be considered a ""pre-phase,"" as it frequently anticipates the development of an overt, classic CMML. In an attempt at improving disease prognostication, the blast count based grading system for CMML of the WHO 2008 Classification has been expanded in 2016 to include a new ""CMML-0"" category. Lastly, the large body of knowledge on the molecular events occurring in CMML has been used to assist diagnosis and assess prognosis. Despite the step forwards, diagnosis of CMML still remains one of exclusion as no clinical, pathologic or molecular findings are specific for this disease. The current review brings insight into the spectrum of CMML and provides practical advice to approach suspected cases of CMML.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Sangiorgio, Valentina Fabiola Ilenia', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Orazi, Attilio']","['Sangiorgio VFI', 'Arber DA', 'Orazi A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3894-2365', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2160-9689', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1660-7013']","['Department of Cellular Pathology, The Royal London Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Paul L.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of DLEU1 in 60 cases of breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were introduced to analyze the correlation between DLEU1 expression and the clinical features of enrolled breast cancer patients. After altering expressions of DLEU1, RAB22A or microRNA-300 by plasmid transfection, the abilities of breast cancer cells to migrate and invade were evaluated by transwell assay. Western blot was conducted to detect protein level changes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes regulated by DLEU1, RAB22A or microRNA-300. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to detect the binding relation between microRNA-300 with DLEU1 and RAB22A. RESULTS: DLEU1 expression remains higher in breast cancer tissues than in normal adjacent tissues, and has a certain diagnostic value. The overall survival of breast cancer patients was negatively correlated with DLEU1 expression. Overexpression of DLEU1 or RAB22A, or microRNA-300 knockdown could enhance the migratory and invasive capacities, as well as increase EMT ofBT549 cells. On the contrary, knockdown of DLEU1 or RAB22A, or microRNA-300 overexpression in MCF-7 cells obtained the opposite trends of cellular behaviors. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that DLEU1 and RAB22A could bind to microRNA-300. Further verification showed that RAB22A expression was positively regulated by DLEU1, but negatively regulated by microRNA-300. Finally, we found that DLEU1 overexpression could reverse the inhibitory effects of microRNA-300 on proliferation, migration, and EMT of breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: DLEU1 is highly expressed in breast cancer, which promotes migration, invasion, and EMT of breast cancer cells by targeting microRNA-300 to mediate RAB22A.",,"['Wang, C', 'Xie, X-X', 'Li, W-J', 'Jiang, D-Q']","['Wang C', 'Xie XX', 'Li WJ', 'Jiang DQ']",,"['Department of Breast Oncology, Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China. jiangzy968@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (DLEU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN300 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RAB22A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Breast/pathology/surgery', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mastectomy', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",,,,,2019/12/17 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201912_19680 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Dec;23(23):10410-10421. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201912_19680.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study, we found its expression was positively correlated with embryonic myogenic ability in pigs, indicating its potential roles in mammalian muscle development. The present work aimed to explore the roles and regulation mechanisms of MLL1 in myogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of MLL1 in C2C12 cells was experimentally manipulated using small interfering RNAs (siRNA). 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, cell cycle assay, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to assess myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was conducted to detect H3K4me3 enrichment on myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) promoter. A cardiotoxin (CTX)-mediated muscle regeneration model was used to investigate the effects of MLL1 on myogenesis in vivo. RESULTS: MLL1 was highly expressed in proliferating C2C12 cells, and expression decreased after differentiation. Knocking down MLL1 suppressed myoblast proliferation and impaired myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of MLL1 resulted in the arrest of cell cycle in G1 phase, with decreased expressions of Myf5 and Cyclin D1. Mechanically, MLL1 transcriptionally regulated Myf5 by mediating H3K4me3 on its promoter. In vivo data implied that MLL1 was required for Pax7-positive satellite cell proliferation and muscle repair. CONCLUSION: MLL1 facilitates proliferation of myoblasts and Pax7-positive satellite cells by epigenetically regulating Myf5 via mediating H3K4me3 on its promoter.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Whether similar epigenetic mechanisms regulate dendtritic cell (DC) function to orchestrate development of adaptive immunity remains unknown. We report that DCs matured with IFNgamma and TNFalpha or matured in the lungs during invasive fungal infection with endogenous TNFalpha acquired a stable TNFalpha-dependent DC1 program, rendering them resistant to both antigen- and cytokine-induced alternative activation. TNFalpha-programmed DC1 had increased association of H3K4me3 with DC1 gene promoter regions. Furthermore, MLL1 inhibition blocked TNFalpha-mediated DC1 phenotype stabilization. During IFI, TNFalpha-programmed DC1s were required for the development of sustained TH1/TH17 protective immunity, and bone marrow pre-DCs exhibited TNFalpha-dependent preprogramming, supporting continuous generation of programmed DC1 throughout the infection.

The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of these retroviruses in domestic cats in Hungary and to characterise the phylogenetic relationships of FIV strains. Methods: A total of 335 anticoagulated whole-blood samples obtained from both a healthy and ill cat population were examined for the presence of FIV and FeLV with two methods: ELISA and PCR. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyse the data obtained. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial polymerase (pol) gene sequences was performed to describe circulating FIV subtypes. Results: Statistical analysis showed 11.8% and 9.9% true prevalence of FeLV and FIV, respectively, with ELISA. The apparent prevalence calculated from the PCR results were 17.3% for FeLV and 13.1% for FIV. Phylogenetic analysis of partial pol gene sequences obtained from 22 FIV strains showed that all observed Hungarian strains belonged to FIV subtype B. The strains were grouped into several monophyletic subgroups reflecting the geographic locations of the origin of the samples. The overall mean genetic similarity between the analysed strains was 98.2%. Conclusions and relevance: We report the first thorough overview of the prevalence of FeLV and FIV in Hungary, which is relatively high, and give insight into the genetic diversity of Hungarian strains of FIV.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],"['Szilasi, Anna', 'Denes, Lilla', 'Kriko, Eszter', 'Heenemann, Kristin', 'Ertl, Reinhard', 'Mandoki, Mira', 'Vahlenkamp, Thomas W', 'Balka, Gyula']","['Szilasi A', 'Denes L', 'Kriko E', 'Heenemann K', 'Ertl R', 'Mandoki M', 'Vahlenkamp TW', 'Balka G']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1634-6730', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7485-3661']","['Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Pest, Hungary.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Pest, Hungary.', 'Centre for Bioinformatics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Pest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Sachsen, Germany.', 'VetCore Facility for Research, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Pest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Sachsen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Pest, Hungary.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191210,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,PMC6904780,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hungary', 'Immunodeficiency virus', 'leukaemia virus', 'phylogeny', 'prevalence']",2019/12/17 06:00,2019/12/17 06:01,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116919892094 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116919892094 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2019 Dec 10;5(2):2055116919892094. doi: 10.1177/2055116919892094. eCollection 2019 Jul-Dec.,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVL is tightly linked to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) however, in which donor T cells damage healthy host tissues. Acute GVHD occurs in nearly 50% of patients receiving HCT, and damages the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The organ stages are totaled in an overall grade (I-IV), and severe (grade III/IV) GVHD has a high mortality rate (50-70%). In the past decade, serum biomarkers have emerged as an additional potential measurement of acute GVHD severity. The discovery and validation of GVHD biomarkers is a principal objective of the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC), a group of 25 HCT centers conducting GVHD research. MAGIC has validated an algorithm that combines two GI biomarkers (ST2 and REG3alpha) into a single value that estimates the probability of 6 month nonrelapse mortality (NRM) for individual patients, known as the MAGIC algorithm probability (MAP). The MAP reflects GI crypt damage and serves as a 'liquid biopsy' of the lower GI tract; it also predicts response to treatment and maximum GVHD severity and is now commercially available and widely used among scores of centers in clinical practice. The MAP is the focus of this review, with consideration of the categorization of types of biomarkers as defined by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).","['(c) The Author(s), 2019.']","['Srinagesh, Hrishikesh K', 'Levine, John E', 'Ferrara, James L M']","['Srinagesh HK', 'Levine JE', 'Ferrara JLM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9786-3010', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8595-3940']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Hess Center for Science and Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1470 Madison Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA039542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191204,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC6893923,,['NOTNLM'],"['FDA-NIH BEST', 'acute graft-versus-host disease', 'biomarkers', 'liquid biopsy', 'responses', 'surrogate endpoints']",2019/12/17 06:00,2019/12/17 06:01,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719891358 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719891358 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Dec 4;10:2040620719891358. doi: 10.1177/2040620719891358. eCollection 2019.,"['Conflict of interest statement: John E.

Originally thought to be an oncogene due to its stabilization in many cancers, it is now considered to be one of the most critical tumor suppressors in a cell's ability to combat neoplastic transformation. Due to its critical roles in apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and senescence, TP53 deletions and mutations are commonly observed and are often a portent of treatment failures and poor clinical outcomes. This is particularly true in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as patients with p53 alterations have historically had dismal outcomes. As such, the tremendous efforts made to better understand the functions of p53 in CLL have contributed substantially to recent advances in treating patients with p53-pathway-deficient CLL.","['(c) The Author(s), 2019.']","['Aitken, Marisa J L', 'Lee, Hun J', 'Post, Sean M']","['Aitken MJL', 'Lee HJ', 'Post SM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7937-531X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9225-200X']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe, Houston, TX 77030-4000, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA207204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191205,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC6896129,,['NOTNLM'],"['17p deletion', 'CLL', 'TP53 mutation', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'venetoclax']",2019/12/17 06:00,2019/12/17 06:01,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719891356 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719891356 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Dec 5;10:2040620719891356. doi: 10.1177/2040620719891356. eCollection 2019.,"['Conflict of interest statement: The author(s) declare that there is no conflict', 'of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commonest trigger of such a presentation is an inflammatory process caused by an overwhelming infection which leads to bone marrow irritation. However, the misdiagnosis of this clinical entity as leukaemia should be avoided at all costs so as to avoid the anxiety associated with a diagnosis of cancer, both to the patients and their families. Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a 22-month-old boy who was referred to our Pediatric Oncology Unit (POU). Owing to a high total leukocyte count (TLC) of 98,000 cells/microl, there was a strong suspicion of leukaemia. The boy had been reviewed at another hospital where he presented with fever and cough refractory to the commencement of tuberculosis medications as a result of chest radiography findings. Laboratory investigations performed on admission in the POU were negative for leukaemia and other myeloproliferative disorders. A chest computer tomography (CT) scan was performed to delineate opacification in the right middle lobe. This revealed multiple necrotic and emphysematous foci in line with a diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia. Subsequently, the patient responded well to a course of piperacillin- tazobactam. The TLC normalized and the cough and fever resolved over a period of 2 weeks. Conclusion: Here, we describe a particularly rare case of leukaemoid reaction with a massive leukocyte count. Such patients can be easily misdiagnosed as having leukaemia or other myeloproliferative disorders, especially in settings with limited diagnostic availability. Such misdiagnosis can cause undue stress on the patient and their families. Thus, it is important that patients presenting with these symptoms should undergo a thorough review of history, physical examination and a structured workup.",['(c) 2019 The College of Medicine and the Medical Association of Malawi.'],"['Jumanne, Shakilu', 'Nyundo, Azan']","['Jumanne S', 'Nyundo A']",,"['Department of Pediatrics & Child Health, College of Health Sciences, University of Dodoma, P.O.

When CLL does affect the CNS, it typically manifests as leptomeningeal involvement, not commonly causing parenchymal involvement unless having undergone a higher grade transformation. We report a case of a patient with untreated CLL who presented with a large right frontal hemorrhagic mass along with additional bilateral masses after being found unresponsive. He had recently been hospitalized with Staphylococcus aureus sepsis. His neurological examination improved after resection of the largest mass however deteriorated again with accumulation of blood in the resection cavity requiring evacuation of the blood products and placement of an external ventricular drain. Pathology from the initial resection revealed sheets of CD20 consistent with untransformed CLL. Additionally, there were areas of necrosis and gram-positive organisms.

However, it remains unclear about its specific role and the underlying mechanism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, this study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of fenretinide-induced apoptosis in AML. METHOD: Firstly, the NR4A1 mRNA level in the newly diagnosed AML patients was measured, then AML cells were treated with fenretinide at various time points and doses, and cell viability was investigated by using the cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Additionally, apoptosis and cell cycles were analyzed by using flow cytometry. Moreover, siNR4A1 was utilized to knockdown NR4A1 expression, and leptomycin B (LMB) was adopted to inhibit the nuclear export; afterwards, the apoptosis rate and expression of apoptotic proteins in AML cells were detected. In addition, the expression levels of NR4A1 in the nuclei and mitochondria of fenretinide-treated AML cells were also measured. Meanwhile, the interaction between NR4A1 and Bcl-2, as well as the Bcl-2 transformation, was also examined. The anti-leukemic effect of fenretinide on NOD/SCID mice was also determined through subcutaneous injection of HL-60 cells. RESULTS: NR4A1 expression in AML patients was markedly down-regulated compared with that in normal donors. Fenretinide induced the expression of NR4A1 and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway-associated proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, both siNR4A1 alone or the combination of fenretinide with LMB could attenuate the fenretinide-induced apoptosis and expression of apoptotic proteins. Under the action of fenretinide, the NR4A1 protein expression was down-regulated in nuclear extracts whereas up-regulated in mitochondrial extracts. At the same time, fenretinide promoted NR4A1 translocation from nuclei into mitochondria, and enhanced the interaction between NR4A1 and Bcl-2, thereby exposing the BH3 domain of Bcl-2 to exert the anti-apoptotic effect. Moreover, fenretinide also exhibited an anti-leukemic effect and induced NR4A1 expression in the AML mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Fenretinide exerts an obvious effect on AML cells both in vitro and in vivo. Besides, the NR4A1-mediated signaling pathway is highly involved in the fenretinide-induced apoptosis of AML cells.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Xiong, Jie', 'Kuang, Xingyi', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Liu, Xu', 'Cheng, Bingqing', 'Wang, Weili', 'Wei, Danna', 'Li, Xinyao', 'Zhang, Zhaoyuan', 'Fang, Qin', 'Wu, Depei', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Xiong J', 'Kuang X', 'Lu T', 'Liu X', 'Cheng B', 'Wang W', 'Wei D', 'Li X', 'Zhang Z', 'Fang Q', 'Wu D', 'Wang J']",,"['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis under Ministry of Health, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Suzhou Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,188 Shizi Street, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University.

Herein we report the successful delivery of siRNA therapeutics with a dual-targeted, layer-by-layer nanoparticle (LbL-NP). The LbL-NP protects siRNA from nucleases in the bloodstream by embedding it within polyelectrolyte layers that coat a polymeric core. The outermost layer consists of hyaluronic acid (a CD44-ligand) covalently conjugated to CD20 antibodies. The CD20/CD44 dual-targeting outer layer provides precise binding to blood cancer cells, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis of the LbL-NP. We use this siRNA delivery platform to silence B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), a pro-survival protein, in vitro and in vivo. The dual-targeting approach significantly enhanced internalization of BCL-2 siRNA in lymphoma and leukemia cells, which led to significant downregulation of BCL-2 expression. Systemic administration of the dual-targeted, siRNA-loaded nanoparticle induced apoptosis and hampered proliferation of blood cancer cells both in cell culture and in orthotopic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma animal models. These results provide the basis for approaches to targeting blood-borne cancers and other diseases, and suggest that LbL nanoassemblies are a promising approach for delivering therapeutic siRNA to hematopoetic cell types that are known to evade transfection by other means.",,"['Choi, Ki Young', 'Correa, Santiago', 'Min, Jouha', 'Li, Jiahe', 'Roy, Sweta', 'Laccetti, Kristiana H', 'Dreaden, Erik', 'Kong, Stephanie', 'Heo, Roun', 'Roh, Young Hoon', 'Lawson, Edward C', 'Palmer, Peter A', 'Hammond, Paula T']","['Choi KY', 'Correa S', 'Min J', 'Li J', 'Roy S', 'Laccetti KH', 'Dreaden E', 'Kong S', 'Heo R', 'Roh YH', 'Lawson EC', 'Palmer PA', 'Hammond PT']",,"['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Natural Product Informatics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung 25451, Republic of Korea.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 440-746, Republic of Korea.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, 19477, USA.', 'Janssen Research and Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, 19477, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['F32 EB017614/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20190327,Germany,Adv Funct Mater,Advanced functional materials,101190390,,,,PMC6910249,['NIHMS1023111'],['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'hematologic cancer', 'layer-by-layer nanoparticles', 'lymphoma', 'siRNA']",2019/12/17 06:00,2019/12/17 06:01,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/adfm.201900018 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Funct Mater. 2019 May 16;29(20). doi: 10.1002/adfm.201900018.

The IgE-producing variant is the rarest sub-type of multiple myeloma, and plasma cell leukaemia is considered to be the rarest and the most aggressive of human monoclonal gammopathies. In November 2015, hypogammaglobulinemia was detected during a systematic check-up. A kappa light chain monoclonal gammopathy was first diagnosed due to an increase of the free kappa/lambda light chains ratio. No monoclonal immunoglobulin was detected by either serum protein electrophoresis (Capillarys 2, Sebia, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France) or immunofixation (Hydrasys 2, Sebia, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France). In June 2018, a blood smear led to the diagnosis of plasma cell leukaemia. A monoclonal peak was detected and identified as IgE-kappa. Analysis of an archival sample taken three years earlier, revealed the presence of a monoclonal IgE, which had been missed at diagnosis. Chemotherapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone was introduced. The patient survived 10 months after the diagnosis of leukaemia. This case shows that an abnormal free light chain ratio should be considered as a possible marker of IgE monoclonal gammopathy even in the absence of a solitary light chain revealed by immunofixation.

She underwent chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which resulted in complete remission. However, she experienced relapse, and remission was achieved each time with repeated transplantation. In September 2014, a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical transplantation, which was the fifth allogeneic transplantation, was performed to treat the third relapse. Platelet transfusion refractoriness, hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, and renal dysfunction were observed from approximately the day of engraftment; therefore, transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) was diagnosed. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) was administered, and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) was infused; this resulted in gradual improvement of TA-TMA. Treatment with rTM and FFP was discontinued on the 70th day after transplantation.

METHODS: The clinical data of 102 patients with ALL from January 2014 to December 2018 were collected and retrospectively studies. The risk factors of chemotherapy-related infections were analyzed by univa-riate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 386 courses of chemotherapy were completed, out of which the infection occurred in 201 course, with the infection rate of 52.07%, identified infection number was 215 case-times, including perianal infection of 13.95% (30/215), oral infection of 13.49% (29/215), blood flow infection of 17striped box21% (37/215), lower respiratory tract infection of 37.21% (80/215), urinary infection of 3.26% (7/215), skin infection of 3.72% (8/215), digestive and intra abdominal infection of 9.30% (20/215), and other infections of 1.86 (4/215). Totally 88 strains of pathogenic bacteria were detected, including 29 Gram-positive bacteria (32.95%), 52 Gram-negative bacteria (59.09%) and 7 fungi (7.95%). Gram-positive bacteria mainly were Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecium, susceptible to tegacycline, vancomycin and linezolid; Gram-negative bacteria mainly were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, susceptible to tegacycline, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem; Candida was the dominant fungus. Living in an ordinart ward, neutrophil defi-ciency for more than 7 days after chemotherapy and incomplete remission were independent risk factors of related infections during the induction chemotherapy in ALL inpatients, and hospitalization time also closely related with chemo-therapy-related infections in ALL inpatients (P<0.05). Neutrophil deficiency for more than 7 days after chemotherapy was an independent risk factor of chemotherapy-related infections in ALL inpatients in the consolidation chemotherapy (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with ALL are prone to chemotherapeutic-related infections, and those who lack neutrophils for more than 7 days after chemotherapy and who do not reach complete remission are more prone to infection.

METHODS: Clinical data, etiology and drug susceptibility of acute leukemia patients with bacterial bloodstream infections from April 2009 to April 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 376 strains were isolated, 76.9% was Gram-negative bacterial and 23.1% was Gram-positive bacteria. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were listed as the top three of Gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to the tigacycline, imipenem and meropenem was 100.0%, 98.2% and 98.1%, respectively. The susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to the tigacycline, imipenem and meropenem were 100.0%, 98.3% and 94.4%, respectively. The adjustment rate for initial use of carbopenems was 3.8%, while the adjustment rate for initial use of noncarbopenems was 74.3% in patients with main Gram-negative bacterial blood stream infection. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to glycopeptide antibiotics, linezolid and tigacycline was 100.0%. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria is the majority type of bacteria in AL patients with bacteria blood stream infections. The susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to the carbapenems is high, and the treatment adjustment rate is obviously low.

METHODS: The clinical data of 63 chlidren with positive RUNX1-RUNX1T1 AML treated by BCH-AML 05 regimen in our hospital from January 2010 to December 2015 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. The level of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 was detected at the time of initial diagnosis (T1), after the first induction treatment (T2), after the second induction treatment (T3), after the first consolidation treatment (T4), after the second consolidation treatment (T5) and after the third consolidation treatment (T6). According to the fusion transcript levels of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 the AML children were divided into low-expression group and high-expression group; the threshold values for grouping were 10(4) copies/10(4) beta-glucuronidase (GUS), 10(3) copies/10(4) GUS, 10(2) copies/10(4) GUS, 10 copies/10(4) GUS, 1 copies/10(4) GUS and 0 copies respectively. The gained data were enrolled in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: 23 cases of 63 children died during the follow-up period, and the median follow-up time of the remaining 40 children were 30.04 (11-60) months. There were statistically significant differences in CD15 positive rate between low-expression group and high-expression group (P<0.05), however, there were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, FAB typing, platelet (Plt) count, hemoglobin (Hb) and white blood cell (WBC) count and the ratio of bone marrow immature cells at T2 between the two groups (P>0.05). Univariate analysis showed that sex, Plt counts at T1 and fusion transcript levels at T1, T2 and T6 correlated with the 5-year overall survival rate (P<0.05).

CONCLUSION: The down-regulation of CD59 gene expression induced by RNAi lenti-virus can decrease the expression of proliferation and differentiation-promoting molecule such as IL-3 and increase the expression of TNF-related factor in Jurkat cell line of acute T-lineage leukemia, which also can increase the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Caspase-3 and BAX, and decrease the expression of anti-apoptosis-related proteins such as Survivin and BCL-2.",,"['Wang, Li-Ping', 'Sun, Chang-Ming', 'Hua, Zheng-Xiang', 'Yan, Li-Na']","['Wang LP', 'Sun CM', 'Hua ZX', 'Yan LN']",,"['Department of Blood Transfusion, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde 067000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of South District Laboratorial Examination, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde 067000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde 067000, Hebei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College, Chengde 067000, Hebei Province, China,E-mailfysxk@sina.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '101754-01-2 (CD59 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'CD59 Antigens', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lentivirus', '*Leukemia', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transfection']",,,,,2019/12/17 06:00,2019/12/27 06:00,['2019/12/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)06-1744-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Dec;27(6):1744-1748. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.06.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MSCs were derived from the bone marrow of newly diagnosed AML patients (AML-MSCs) and health donors(MSCs) were co-cultured with HL-60 cells respectively. The apoptosis of HL-60 cells in the presence/absence of MSCs and/or Daunorubicin were determined by flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI double staining. In addition, the morphological features of HL-60 cells were observed by Wright-Giemsa staining, and the ratio of blasts and differentiated cells were counted. Furthermore, the expressions of apoptosis-related factors including Caspase-3, Caspase-8,Caspase-9 and Survivin were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The flow cytometry showed that there was no significant change in apoptosis of HL-60 cells co-cultured with MSC derived from healthy donors or AML patients. After adding Daunorubicin into different cultural systems, the apoptotic rates of HL-60, HL-60 co-cultured with normal MSCs and HL-60 co-cultured with AML-MSCs were (49.57+/-7.44)%, (30.72+/-4.05)% and (22.99+/-4.08)%, respectively, which showed that normal MSCs and AML-MSCs could remarkably supress Daunorubicin-induced HL-60 apoptosis, however, there was no statistically significant difference of apoptosis between HL-60 co-cultured with normal MSCs and HL-60 co-cultured with AML-MSCs. Wright-Giemsa staining showed that most of the HL-60 cells co-cultured with AML-MSCs were primitive, and cell differentiation was unusual. In AML-MSCs co-cultured group, the cell apoptosis and differentiation caused by DNR was significant decreased, and most of HL-60 cells were initial. Western blot showed that the cleavage activity of Caspase-3 of HL-60 in AML-MSCs and normal MSCs co-cultured group was decreased, compared with HL-60 in single cultured group, moreover, the decrease was significantly in AML-MSC group. Additionally, the expression of survivin in AML-MSCs and normal MSCs co-cultured group was increased, compared with that in single cultured group, and increase was significant in AML-MSCs group.

METHODS: Eighty-six newly diagnosed ALL childhood patients from January 2007 to January 2017 treated in our hospital were selected. The expression level of CCR7 and Tim-3 in bone marrow isolated cells of ALL patients were detected by flow cytometry, all the patients were divided into the recurrence group and non-recurrence group according to the follow-up results, the differences in the expressions of CCR7, Tim-3 between the two groups were compared. The correlation between the expression of CCR7 , Tim-3 and the clinicopathologic features of ALL patients were analyzed, the predictive value of CCR7 and Tim-3 for the prognosis of newly ALL patients were evaluated by ROC curve, and the relationship between serum CCR7, Tim-3 and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression levels of CCR7 and Tim-3 in recurrence group were significantly higher than those in non-recurrence group(P<0.05). The critical value of CCR7 for diagnosis of recurrence was 45.97%, the sensitivity was 66.7%, the specificity was the 84.5% and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.798 (95CI 0.777-0.939). The critical value of Tim-3 for diagnosis of recurrence was 53.54%, the sensitivity was 73.3%, the specificity was the 80.3% and the AUC was 0.806 (95CI 0.792-0.947). The AUC of the combined detection of CCR7 and Tim-3 was 0.895 (95CI 0.914-0.996), sensitivity 86.6%, specificity 78.9% (P<0.05); There was no significant correlation between CCR7, Tim-3 expression and age, sex, hemoglobin concentration, number of white blood cells, bone marrow blasts, platelets, central nervous system invasion, fusion gene (P>0.05). The exogenous infiltration rate of patients with high expression of CCR7 and Tim-3 was significantly higher than those in low expression group (P<0striped box05). The high expression rate 76.9% of Tim-3 in patients with T-ALL was significantly higher than that of B-ALL patients with Tim-3 high expression rate 45.2% (P<0.05). The median OS of patients with CCR7 level >/=45.97% and <45.97% were 9.3 months and 13.6 months respectively(P=0.004), and the Tim-3>/=53.54% and Tim-3<53.54% were 9.1 months and 13.6 months respectively(P=0.001). The results of Cox's multi-factor regression analysis showed that CCR7 level(HR=1.024, 95 CI 1.001-1.049) and Tim-3 level (HR=1.879, 95 CI 1.183- 2.985) were the independent risk factors that affect the OS in ALL patients(P<0.05).

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients with T-ALL treated in our hospital from January 2014 to May 2018 were selected, and 120 healthy people were selected as control group. The bone marrow of the patients were collected, and mononuclear cells were separated out. PTEN gene expression level was detected by RT-PCR, PTEN protein expression level was detected by Western blot, Kaplan-Meier was used to analyze the survival rate of patients with T-ALL, Cox multivariate regression analyzed was used to analyze the independent influencing factors of patients, and the correlation between PTEN level and clinical characteristics of patients with T-ALL and its prognostic value were analyzed. RESULTS: The relative level of PTEN gene in patients with T-ALL was 0.19+/-0.06, which was significantly lower than that in control groups (P<0.05). There was significantly positive correlation of the expression level of PTEN gene with white blood cell count r=0.993and peripheral blood immature cells r=0.996 in patients with T-ALL. There was no correlation between PTEN gene expression level and sex, age, LDH level, Hb level, platelet count in patients with T-ALL. And it was found that expression levels PTEN protein in the middle-risk group, the standard-risk group and the high-risk group were significant lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), while those in the high-risk group were significantly lower than those in other groups (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that OS and DFS in PTEN gene high expression group were higher than those in PTEN low expression group (P<0.05). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that white blood cell count and PTEN gene were independent influencing factors of OS (P<0.05); platelet count and PTEN gene were independent influencing factors of DFS (P<0.05).

CSCs play a critical role in therapeutic failure and are responsible for poor prognosis in leukemia and various solid tumors. However, it is still unclear how CSCs initiate carcinogenesis and evade the immune response. In humans, the melanoma initiating cells (MICs) are recognized as the CSCs in melanomas, and were verified to possess CSC potentials. The enzymatic system, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is considered to be a specific marker for CSCs in several tumors. The expression of ALDH in MICs may be closely correlated with phenotypic heterogeneity, melanoma-genesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. The ALDH(+) CSCs/MICs not only serve as an indicator for therapeutic efficacy, but have also become a target for the treat of melanoma. In this review, we initially introduce the multiple capacities of MICs in melanoma. Then, we summarize in vivo and in vitro studies that illustrate the relationship between ALDH and MICs. Furthermore, understanding of chemotherapy resistance in melanoma relies on ALDH(+) MICs. Finally, we review studies that focus on melanoma immunotherapies, rendering ALDH a potential marker to evaluate the efficacy of anti-neoplastic therapies or an adjuvant anti-melanoma target.",,"['Zhang, Simin', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Qi, Fazhi']","['Zhang S', 'Yang Z', 'Qi F']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4408-7289', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1442-275X']","[""Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, Xuhui District, 200032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, Xuhui District, 200032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, Xuhui District, 200032, People's Republic of China. qifazhi@163.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191214,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,['EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*pathology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Melanoma/*enzymology/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*pathology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALDH', 'Cancer stem cells', 'Drug resistance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Melanoma']",2019/12/16 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2019/12/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-019-05227-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-019-05227-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 Feb;47(2):1435-1443. doi: 10.1007/s11033-019-05227-2.

While reduction in some toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation has been confirmed in randomised clinical trials, they have not been powered to evaluate improved anticancer efficacy. A lack of data on the clinical potencies of the main nutritionally-relevant forms of Se and the relationship between their pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in cancer patients has hampered progress to date. The primary objective of this study was to determine the dose and form of Se that can be most safely and effectively used in clinical trials in combination with anti-cancer therapies. STUDY METHODS: In a phase I randomised double-blinded study, the PD profile of sodium selenite (SS), Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC) and seleno-l-methionine (SLM) were compared in two cohorts of 12 patients, one cohort with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and the other with solid malignancies. All 24 patients were randomised to receive 400 mug of elemental Se as either SS, MSC or SLM, taken orally daily for 8 weeks. PD parameters were assessed before, during and 4 weeks after Se compound exposure in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RESULTS: No significant sustained changes were observed in plasma concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor-alpha (VEGF-alpha), expression of proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (the unfolded protein response) or in intracellular total glutathione in PBMCs, in either disease cohort or when grouped by Se compound. CONCLUSIONS: At the 400 mug dose level no substantial changes in PD parameters were noted. Extrapolating from pre-clinical data, the dose examined in this cohort was too low to achieve the Se plasma concentration (>/= 5 muM) expected to elicit significant PD effects. Recruitment of a subsequent cohort at higher doses to exceed this PK threshold is planned.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

In this nationwide study by the ""French Network of dysimmune disorders associated with hemopathies"" (MINHEMON) the objective was to evaluate characteristics, treatment and outcome of GCA MDS-MDS/MPN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients that presented a MDS or MDS/MPN associated with GCA. Treatment efficiency, relapse-free and overall survival of GCA MDS-MDS/MPN were compared to GCA alone. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with GCA MDS-MDS/MPN were included with median age 76 [42-92], M/F ratio 2.5, 8 MDS with multilineage dysplasia (38%), 4 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (19%), at low or intermediate risk according to IPPS and IPSS-R. The prevalence of headaches, jaw claudication and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was significantly lower in patients with GCA MDS-MDS/MPN compared to idiopathic GCA (14.3%, 0% and 0% versus 30%, 25%, and 25%, respectively; p < .05). Other clinical and histology findings were similar. All GCA patients received steroid therapy as first-line treatment. Complete or partial response was observed in 14 GCA MDS-MDS/MPN patients (66.7%), of whom 6 (28.6%) received combined immunosuppressive therapies (versus 10% of idiopathic GCA; p = .07). Relapse incidence was similar in the two groups. Steroid dependence was more frequent among GCA MDS-MDS/MPN patients (12 (57%) versus 18 (22.5%); p < .05). Relapse-free and steroid-free survivals were significantly decreased in GCA MDS-MDS/MPN patients (log rank 0.002 and 0.049 respectively), but not overall survival. CONCLUSION: Characteristics of GCA MDS-MDS/MPN seem different than idiopathic GCA, with a distinct clinical phenotype and poorer outcome with a higher risk of steroid dependence and relapse.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We therefore aimed to assess the activity of alisertib combined with 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did a single-arm, phase 2 trial of patients recruited from the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in the USA. Eligible patients had previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and were at high risk of disease as defined by the presence of an adverse-risk karyotype, the presence of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia arising from previous myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm, the presence of therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia, or being 65 years or older. Enrolled patients received 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy of continuous infusion of cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-7) and intravenous bolus of idarubicin (12 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-3). Oral alisertib (30 mg) was given twice per day on days 8-15. Patients could receive up to four consolidation cycles with cytarabine and alisertib, and alisertib maintenance for 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite including the proportion of patients achieving complete remission and those with a complete remission with incomplete neutrophil or platelet count recovery. Analyses were per-protocol. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02560025, and has completed enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Dec 31, 2015, and Aug 1, 2017, we enrolled a total of 39 eligible patients. 19 (49%) of 39 patients had secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and three (8%) had therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia. At mid-induction, 33 (85%) of 39 patients showed marrow aplasia, six (15%) received re-induction. The median follow-up was 13.7 months (IQR 12.7-14.4). Composite remission was 64% (two-stage 95% CI 48-79), with 20 (51%) of 39 patients achieving complete remission and five (13%) achieving complete remission with incomplete neutrophil or platelet count recovery. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included febrile neutropenia (16 [41%] of 39), neutropenia (12 [31%]), thrombocytopenia (13 [33%]), anaemia (11 [28%]), anorexia (nine [23%]), and oral mucositis (four [10%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that alisertib combined with induction chemotherapy is active and safe in previously untreated patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia. This study met criteria to move forward to a future randomised trial. FUNDING: Millennium Pharmaceuticals.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although COP has been associated with a variety of health effects among workers around the world, such effects have not been adequately investigated in the Amazon region, especially at the community level. Therefore, this review was conducted to provide a report about COP in the Amazon of Ecuador and about its association with health status of indigenous human populations. Some epidemiological surveys in the Amazonian Territories indicate that COP has been associated with health problems in the surrounding populations, e.g. cancers in the stomach, rectum, skin, soft tissue, kidney and cervix in adults, and leukemia in children. In addition, some biomarkers and mechanistic studies show exposure effects. However, due to limitations from these studies, contradictory associations have been reported. Our review indicates that COP in the Amazonian territories of northern Ecuador was characterised by contamination which could have affected the indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However, there have not been dedicated investigations to provide relationships between the contamination and the subsequent exposure-health effects. Since indigenous populations have different lifestyle and cultures from regular city dwellers, systematic studies on their potential health hazards need to be conducted. Due to the remote locations and sparse populations, these new studies may involve the use of novel and genomic-based biomarkers as well as using high technology in the remote regions.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

A UK CCLG Surgeons Cancer Group nationwide study.,2026-2029,S0022-3468(19)30794-8 [pii] 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2019.10.059 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Ovarian tumors in children are rare, mature teratoma being the most common histological entity. Robust guidelines to aid patient follow-up after resection are distinctly lacking. Although mature teratoma has a very good prognosis following complete resection, small studies have reported the occurrence of metachronous disease and recurrence to a variable degree (2.5-23% of patients). Nevertheless, there are surgeons who recommend no follow-up is required for these children after primary tumor resection. We investigated the incidence of (i) recurrence and (ii) metachronous disease in pediatric patients following ovarian tumor resection. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study amongst UK pediatric surgical oncology centers. Females <16years with diagnosis of ovarian tumor from 2006 to 2016 were included. Functional/neonatal ovarian cysts were excluded. RESULTS: Three hundred ten patients with ovarian tumors treated at 12 surgical oncology centers were identified. Mean age at surgery was 11years [IQR 8-14]. Most common diagnosis were mature teratoma (57%, 177 cases), immature teratoma (10.9%, 34 cases) and serous cystadenoma (7.7%, 24 cases). 8.1% (25 cases) of all females were identified with tumor recurrence/ metachronous disease. 5.1% (9 cases) of patients with mature teratoma had recurrent/ metachronous disease. Most of these patients were diagnosed at routine clinic follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our study clearly shows that ovarian tumor recurrence(s) and metachronous disease occur, even in ""benign"" ovarian tumors. We recommend female pediatric patients should have robust follow-up care plans after primary diagnosis and resection of ovarian tumor(s). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE STATEMENT: This is a level II evidence study. It is a retrospective multicentre collaborative study which summarizes data from a national cohort of children.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process was initially developed in an academic setting and subsequently transferred to industry for qualification, validation and scaling up for global clinical trials and commercial distribution. Use of fresh leukapheresis material was recognized early on in the transfer process as a challenge with regard to establishing a global supply chain. To maximize manufacturing success rates and to overcome logistical challenges, cryopreservation was adapted into the Novartis manufacturing process from the beginning of clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel manufactured in centralized facilities with cryopreserved leukapheresis material has been used successfully in global clinical trials at more than 50 clinical centers in 12 countries. Cryopreservation provides flexibility in scheduling leukapheresis when the patient's health is optimal to provide T cells; it also provides protection from external factors, such as shipping delays, and removes manufacturing time constraints. Several studies were performed to establish comparability of fresh versus cryopreserved leukapheresis material, to evaluate and optimize the cryopreservation process, to determine the optimal temperature and maximum hold time prior to cryopreservation and to determine the optimal temperature range for shipment and storage. Using the current validated industry manufacturing process, high success rates were achieved with regard to manufacturing tisagenlecleucel batches that met specifications and were released to patients. Consistent product quality and positive clinical outcomes support the use of cryopreserved non-mobilized peripheral mononuclear blood cells collected using leukapheresis for CAR-T cell manufacturing.","['Copyright (c) 2019 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy.

In this study, we evaluated S116836, a novel BCR-ABL inhibitor, for its anti-cancer efficacy in the wild-type (WT) and T315I mutant BCR-ABL. S116836 was efficacious in BaF3 cells with WT or T315I mutated BCR-ABL genotypes. S116836 inhibits the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and its downstream signaling in BaF3/WT and BaF3/T315I cells. Mechanistically, S116836 arrests the cells in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, induces apoptosis, increases ROS production, and decreases GSH production in BaF3/WT and BaF3/T315I cells. Moreover, in mouse tumor xenografts, S116836 significantly inhibits the growth and volume of tumors expressing the WT or T315I mutant BCR-ABL without causing significant cardiotoxicity. Overall, our results indicate that S116836 significantly inhibits the imatinib-resistant T315I BCR-ABL mutation and could be a novel drug candidate for treating imatinib-resistant CML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

YM155-induced apoptosis of human CML K562 cells was characterized by ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and survivin and MCL1 downregulation. Moreover, YM155-induced autophagy caused degradation of HuR mRNA and downregulation of HuR protein expression, which resulted in destabilized survivin and MCL1 mRNA. Interestingly, survivin and MCL1 suppression contributed to autophagy-mediated HuR mRNA destabilization in YM155-treated cells. Pretreatment with inhibitors of p38 MAPK or autophagy alleviated YM155-induced autophagy and apoptosis in K562 cells, as well as YM155-induced downregulation of HuR, survivin, and MCL1. Ectopic overexpression of HuR, survivin, or MCL1 attenuated the cytotoxic effect of YM155 on K562 cells. Conversely, YM155 sensitized K562 cells to ABT-199 (a BCL2 inhibitor), and circumvented K562 cell resistance to ABT-199 because of its inhibitory effect on survivin and MCL1 expression. Overall, our data indicate that YM155-induced apoptosis is mediated by inducing autophagic HuR mRNA degradation, and reveal the pathway responsible for YM155-induced downregulation of survivin and MCL1 in K562 cells. Our findings also indicate a similar pathway underlying YM155-induced death in human CML MEG-01 cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim is to explore the role of lncRNA potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) and associated novel mechanisms in the progression and chemoresistance of AML. MAIN METHODS: The expression of KCNQ1OT1, miR-193a-3p, and Tspan3 was measured by qRT-PCR. The values of IC50 for adriamycin (ADR) and the ability of proliferation were analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay. Cell apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry assay. The expression of Tspan3, MRP1, P-gp and LRP at the protein level was quantified by western blot. The relationship between miR-193a-3p and KCNQ1OT1 or Tspan3 was predicted by bioinformatics tool Diana and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay or RNA pull-down assay. KEY FINDINGS: KCNQ1OT1 and Tspan3 were up-regulated, while miR-193a-3p was down-regulated in ADR resistant AML samples and cells. KCNQ1OT1 knockdown reduced ADR resistance, inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis of ADR resistant AML cells, miR-193a-3p inhibition reversed these effects. MiR-193a-3p was a target of KCNQ1OT1 and combined with Tspan3 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). Enrichment of miR-193a-3p decreased ADR resistance, inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion and stimulated apoptosis in ADR resistant AML cells, but Tspan3 overexpression overturned these impacts. SIGNIFICANCE: KCNQ1OT1 aggravates AML progression and chemoresistance to ADR by inducing Tspan3 expression via adsorbing miR-193a-3p in ADR resistant AML cells, providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of AML with chemoresistance.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the collaborative role between NK cells and Mvarphi remains underappreciated, especially in hematological cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We observed a higher ratio of innate immune cells (Mvarphi and NK) to adaptive immune cells (T and B cells) in CML bone marrow aspirates, prompting us to investigate the roles of NK and Mvarphi in CML. Using coculture models simulating the tumor inflammatory environment, we observed that Mvarphi protects CML from NK attack only when CML was itself mycoplasma-infected and under chronic infection-inflammation condition. We found that the Mvarphi-protective effect on CML was associated with the maintenance of CD16 level on the NK cell membrane. Although the NK membrane CD16 (mCD16) was actively shed in Mvarphi + NK + CML trioculture, the NK mCD16 level was maintained, and this was independent of the modulation of sheddase by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 or inhibitory cytokine transforming growth factor beta. Instead, we found that this process of NK mCD16 maintenance was conferred by Mvarphi in a contact-dependent manner. We propose a new perspective on anti-CML strategy through abrogating Mvarphi-mediated retention of NK surface CD16.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Two-drug combination caused a more effective decrease in cell viability and in induction of S phase arrest, DNA damage, and cell apoptosis than that of ATRA or BDMC only. Also, the two-drug combination caused more cells to undergo significantly increased ROS productions when compared to that of ATRA or BDMC only. Results of Western blotting demonstrated that two-drug combination increased expressions of Fas, pro-apoptotic proteins, and active form of caspase-3 and -9, but decreased that of anti-apoptotic proteins and XIAP than that of ATRA or BDMC only in Hep 3B cells. In conclusion, ATRA combined with BDMC enhance cell apoptosis and associated protein expression in Hep 3B cells. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) derived from natural plants, turmeric (Curcuma longa), which had been used for Asia food for thousands of years. All-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) is currently used as a primary treatment for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. In previous study, ATRA and BDMC were reported to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. Our results showed that treatment of ATRA combined with BDMC showed more effectively apoptosis than that of ATRA or BDMC only in Hep 3B cells. The findings also provided possible pathways concerning the induction of liver cancer cell apoptosis. We conclude that ATRA combined with BDMC may be potent anticancer agents or adjuvants for liver cancer therapy in the future.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Huang, Ting-Yi', 'Peng, Shu-Fen', 'Huang, Yi-Ping', 'Tsai, Chang-Hai', 'Tsai, Fuu-Jen', 'Huang, Chih-Yang', 'Tang, Chih-Hsin', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Hsu, Yuan-Man', 'Yin, Mei-Chin', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Huang TY', 'Peng SF', 'Huang YP', 'Tsai CH', 'Tsai FJ', 'Huang CY', 'Tang CH', 'Yang JS', 'Hsu YM', 'Yin MC', 'Huang WW', 'Chung JG']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7303-2287'],"['Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""China Medical University Children's Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""China Medical University Children's Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'School of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Chinese Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Chinese Medicine Research Center, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Nutrition and Health Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191214,United States,J Food Biochem,Journal of food biochemistry,7706045,"['0 (Diarylheptanoids)', '2EFO1BP34R (bis(4-hydroxycinnamoyl)methane)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Diarylheptanoids', 'Humans', '*Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hep 3B human liver cancer cells', '*all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA)', '*apoptosis', '*bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC)', '*combination therapy']",2019/12/15 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2019/12/15 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jfbc.13122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Biochem. 2020 Feb;44(2):e13122. doi: 10.1111/jfbc.13122.

Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents against T-ALL is imperative. Previous studies have shown that chrysophanol (CHL), an anthraquinone compound isolated from the Rheum palmatum L., exerts anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects in multiple malignant tumors. However, the effect of CHL on the progression of TALL is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to explore the role of CHL in the biological behavior of T-ALL cells and determine its underlying mechanism. Both T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat and TALL-104) were treated with CHL. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of T-ALL cells were determined by CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, and Transwell assay, respectively. Western blot and RT-qPCR were applied to examine gene expression. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to examine the regulation mechanism of miR-9 and PD-L1. A T-ALL xenograft model also was used to examine the effect of CHL on the tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. CHL treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of both Jurkat and TALL-104 cells and induced cell apoptosis and the expression of miR-9. Moreover, miR-9 was proved to target PD-L1 by binding to its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Mechanically, pretreated with PD-L1 inhibitor could augment the anti-proliferation and anti-metastatic effect of CHL, while miR-9-silenced alleviated this effect. Consistent with in vitro studies, CHL significantly suppressed the growth and metastasis of tumor in vivo. Our finding uncovers the antitumorigenic effect of CHL in T-ALL progression through upregulating the expression of miR-9 and suppressing PD-L1 expression, which may provide a new potential strategy for T-ALL clinical treatment.",,"['Yin, Junjie', 'Yin, Qingsong', 'Liang, Bo', 'Mi, Ruihua', 'Ai, Hao', 'Chen, Lin', 'Wei, Xudong']","['Yin J', 'Yin Q', 'Liang B', 'Mi R', 'Ai H', 'Chen L', 'Wei X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1703-1175'],"['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Xinxiang, Xinxiang City, 453002, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, 450008, Henan Province, China. yinqingsong12@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Xinxiang, Xinxiang City, 453002, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, 450008, Henan Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20191214,Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,,IM,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chrysophanol', '*Growth and metastasis', '*PD-L1', '*T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*miR-9']",2019/12/15 06:00,2019/12/15 06:01,['2019/12/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/15 06:01 [medline]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00210-019-01778-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00210-019-01778-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2020 Feb;393(2):273-286. doi: 10.1007/s00210-019-01778-0.

Here, the effect of the anti-CD37 antibody-radionuclide conjugate lutetium-177 ((177)Lu)-lilotomab (Betalutin((R))) was investigated in preclinical models of NHL. In SCID mice bearing DOHH2 (transformed follicular lymphoma, FL) cell xenografts, (177)Lu-lilotomab significantly delayed tumor growth, even at low activity (100 MBq/kg). In athymic mice bearing OCI-Ly8 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL) or Ramos (Burkitt's lymphoma) cell xenografts, (177)Lu-lilotomab activity had to be increased to 500 MBq/kg to show a significant tumor growth delay. Clonogenic and proliferation assays showed that DOHH2 cells were highly sensitive to (177)Lu-lilotomab, while Ramos cells were the least sensitive, and U2932 (DLBCL), OCI-Ly8, and Rec-1 (mantle cell lymphoma) cells displayed intermediate sensitivity. The strong (177)Lu-lilotomab cytotoxicity observed in DOHH2 cells correlated with reduced G2/M cell cycle arrest, lower WEE-1- and MYT-1-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1), and higher apoptosis. In agreement, (177)Lu-lilotomab efficacy in vitro, in vivo, and in patient samples was increased when combined with G2/M cell cycle arrest inhibitors (MK-1775 and PD-166285).

In this study, we employed IgH.TEmu mice, which spontaneously develop CLL, and stable EMC CLL cell lines derived from these mice to explore the role of phosphatases in CLL. Genome-wide expression profiling comparing IgH.TEmu CLL cells with wild-type splenic B cells identified 96 differentially expressed phosphatase genes, including SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (Ship2). We found that B cell-specific deletion of Ship2, but not of its close homolog Ship1, significantly reduced CLL formation in IgH.TEmu mice. Treatment of EMC cell lines with Ship1/2 small molecule inhibitors resulted in the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, we observed that blocking Ship1/2 abrogated EMC cell survival by exerting dual effects on the BCR signaling cascade. On one hand, specific Ship1 inhibition enhanced calcium signaling and thereby abrogated an anergic response to BCR stimulation in CLL cells. On the other hand, concomitant Ship1/Ship2 inhibition or specific Ship2 inhibition reduced constitutive activation of the mTORC1/ribosomal protein S6 pathway and downregulated constitutive expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, in both EMC cell lines and primary IgH.TEmu CLL cells. Importantly, also in human CLL, we found overexpression of many phosphatases including SHIP2. Inhibition of SHIP1/SHIP2 reduced cellular survival and S6 phosphorylation and enhanced basal calcium levels in human CLL cells. Taken together, we provide evidence that SHIP2 contributes to CLL pathogenesis in mouse and human CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Pal Singh, Simar', 'de Bruijn, Marjolein J W', 'Velaso Gago da Graca, Catarina', 'Corneth, Odilia B J', 'Rip, Jasper', 'Stadhouders, Ralph', 'Meijers, Ruud W J', 'Schurmans, Stephane', 'Kerr, William G', 'Ter Burg, Johanna', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Pillai, Saravanan Y', 'Hendriks, Rudi W']","['Pal Singh S', 'de Bruijn MJW', 'Velaso Gago da Graca C', 'Corneth OBJ', 'Rip J', 'Stadhouders R', 'Meijers RWJ', 'Schurmans S', 'Kerr WG', 'Ter Burg J', 'Eldering E', 'Langerak AW', 'Pillai SY', 'Hendriks RW']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2902-5899', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1060-5607', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8170-1447', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5579-3840', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4720-7135', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2078-3220', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1871-918X']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Postgraduate School Molecular Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique Fonctionnelle, GIGA-Research Centre, Universite de Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210; and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, NL 3000 CA Rotterdam, the Netherlands; r.hendriks@erasmusmc.nl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191213,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['EC 3.1.3.86 (Inppl1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,2019/12/15 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2019/12/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900153 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900153 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Jan 15;204(2):360-374. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900153.

Our laboratory has characterized acquired resistance to etoposide in human leukemia K562 cells. The clonal resistant subline K/VP.5 contains reduced TOP2alpha/170 mRNA and protein levels compared with parental K562 cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mechanisms play a role in drug resistance via decreased expression of TOP2alpha/170. miRNA-sequencing revealed that human miR-9-3p and miR-9-5p were among the top six of those overexpressed in K/VP.5 compared with K562 cells; validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated overexpression of both miRNAs. miRNA recognition elements (MREs) for both miRNAs are present in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TOP2alpha/170. Transfecting K562 cells with a reporter plasmid harboring the TOP2alpha/170 3'-UTR together with either miR-9-3p or miR-9-5p mimics resulted in a statistically significant decrease in luciferase expression. Mutating the miR-9-3p or miR-9-5p MREs prevented this decrease, demonstrating direct interaction between these miRNAs and TOP2alpha/170 mRNA. Transfection of K562 cells with miR-9-3p or miR-9-5p mimics led to decreased TOP2alpha/170 protein levels without a change in TOP2alpha/170 mRNA and resulted in attenuated etoposide-induced DNA damage (gain-of-miRNA-inhibitory function). Conversely, transfection of miR-9-3p or miR-9-5p inhibitors in K/VP.5 cells (overexpressed miR-9 and low TOP2alpha/170) led to increased TOP2alpha/170 protein expression without a change in TOP2alpha/170 mRNA levels and resulted in enhancement of etoposide-induced DNA damage (loss-of-miRNA-inhibitory function). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that these miRNAs play a role in and are potential targets for circumvention of acquired resistance to etoposide. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Results presented here indicate that miR-9-3p and miR-9-5p decrease DNA topoisomerase IIalpha protein 170 kDa expression levels in acquired resistance to etoposide. These findings contribute new information about and potential strategies for circumvention of drug resistance by modulation of microRNA levels. Furthermore, increased expression of miR-9-3p and miR-9-5p in chemoresistant cancer cells may support their validation as biomarkers of responsiveness to DNA topoisomerase II-targeted therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Kania, Evan E', 'Carvajal-Moreno, Jessika', 'Hernandez, Victor A', 'English, Anthony', 'Papa, Jonathan L', 'Shkolnikov, Nicholas', 'Ozer, Hatice Gulcin', 'Yilmaz, Ayse Selen', 'Yalowich, Jack C', 'Elton, Terry S']","['Kania EE', 'Carvajal-Moreno J', 'Hernandez VA', 'English A', 'Papa JL', 'Shkolnikov N', 'Ozer HG', 'Yilmaz AS', 'Yalowich JC', 'Elton TS']",,"['Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio yalowich.1@osu.edu.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy (E.E.K., J.C.-M., V.A.H., A.E., J.L.P., N.S., J.C.Y., T.S.E.) and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine (H.G.O., A.S.Y.), The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio elton.8@osu.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 CA226906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191213,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MIRN93 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN95 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology']",PMC6978698,,,,2019/12/15 06:00,2020/04/25 06:00,['2019/12/15 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['mol.119.118315 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.119.118315 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2020 Mar;97(3):159-170. doi: 10.1124/mol.119.118315.

By screening dozens of reported natural compounds using both wild-type and mutant IDH1 enzymatic assays, we discovered Licochalcone A is a selective inhibitor to the R132C-mutant IDH1 with an IC50 value of 5.176 muM, and inhibits the proliferation of sarcoma HT-1080 cells with an IC50 value of 10.75 muM.

Revealed by the RNA-Seq data analysis, the Cell Cycle pathway was the most over-represented pathway for HT-1080 cells treated with Licochalcone A. Consistent with these results, Licochalcone A induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HT-1080 cells, while it showed minimal effect against the proliferation of normal RCTEC cells. The discovery of Licochalcone A as a mutation-selective IDH1 inhibitor can serve as a promising starting point for the development of mutation-selective anti-tumor lead compounds targeting IDH1.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The transmembrane subunit of the BLV envelope glycoprotein, gp30, contains three completely conserved YXXL sequences that fit an endocytic sorting motif. The two N-terminal YXXL sequences are reportedly critical for viral infection. However, their actual function in the viral life cycle remains undetermined. Here, we identified the novel roles of each YXXL sequence. Syncytia formation ability was upregulated by a single mutation of the tyrosine (Tyr) residue in any of the three YXXL sequences, indicating that each YXXL sequence is independently able to regulate the fusion event. The alteration resulted from significantly high expression of gp51 on the cell surface, thereby decreasing the amount of gp51 in early endosomes and further revealing that the three YXXL sequences are independently required for internalization of the envelope (Env) protein, following transport to the cell surface. Moreover, the 2nd and 3rd YXXL sequences contributed to Env protein incorporation into the virion by functionally distinct mechanisms.

The study included 22 AML patients at diagnosis; all data were compared with the results of S5 sequencing, and discordant variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Nanopore approach showed substantial advantages in terms of speed and low cost. Furthermore, the ability to generate long reads allows a more accurate detection of longer FLT3 internal tandem duplications and phasing double CEBPA mutations.

Its association with hematologic malignancies, although a rare occurrence, has been previously described. Among this subset of patients, chronic myeloid leukemia is one of the main causes. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 26-year-old male with history of chronic myeloid leukemia presented with acute intense abdominal right lower quadrant pain. Computed tomography showed a wedge in the lower third of the spleen (probably associated with infarction), active bleeding, and hemoperitoneum. Laparotomy and splenectomy were performed. DISCUSSION: The most common symptom of spontaneous splenic rupture is acute abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. It can also be associated with nausea, emesis and signs of hypovolemia or shock. Splenomegaly may be absent. Diagnostic methods of choice are computed tomography and ultrasound. Management of splenic rupture is divided in surgical and conservative. The former is reserved for patients with extensive splenic injury that is accompanied by hemodynamic instability or other trauma that warrants surgical treatment. Patients who do not meet these criteria and respond to initial stabilization strategies can be offered clinical and laboratory monitoring. Stable patients with moderate to severe splenic injuries can be offered angioembolization. CONCLUSION: It is important to include splenic rupture as a differential diagnosis for acute abdominal pain, especially in patients with hematologic malignancy, since early recognition and treatment increases patient survival and improves prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

The presence of mutant proteins prone to misfolding can render the cells sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress that could otherwise be overcome. Here, we show that the triple combination of the differentiating agent retinoic acid (RA), the ER stress-inducing drug tunicamycin (Tm), and arsenic trioxide (ATO), able to generate oxidative stress, leads to the death of AML cell lines expressing fusion proteins involving the gene MLL and the internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase receptor. Importantly, the combination of RA, Tm, and ATO decreased the colony-forming capacity of primary leukemic blasts bearing the FLT-ITD mutation without affecting healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Large deletions encompassing MN1 have been reported in individuals with variable neurodevelopmental anomalies and non-specific facial features. We identified a cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 23 individuals with strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. Imaging revealed an atypical form of rhombencephalosynapsis, a distinctive brain malformation characterized by partial or complete loss of the cerebellar vermis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, in 8/10 individuals. Rhombencephalosynapsis has no previously known definitive genetic or environmental causes. Other frequent features included perisylvian polymicrogyria, abnormal posterior clinoid processes and persistent trigeminal artery. MN1 is encoded by only two exons. All mutations, including the recurrent variant p.Arg1295* observed in 8/21 probands, fall in the terminal exon or the extreme 3' region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to result in escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This was confirmed in fibroblasts from three individuals. We propose that the condition described here, MN1 C-terminal truncation (MCTT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsufficiency but rather is the result of dominantly acting C-terminally truncated MN1 protein. Our data show that MN1 plays a critical role in human craniofacial and brain development, and opens the door to understanding the biological mechanisms underlying rhombencephalosynapsis.","['(c) The Author(s) (2019).

Histone methylation and demethylation are types of epigenetic modification in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Abnormal expression of histone demethylases is indicated in many types of cancer including AML. Although many commercial drugs are available to treat AML, an absolute cure has not been discovered yet. However, inhibition of demethylases could be a potential cure for AML. Methylstat is a chemical agent that inhibits the Jumonji C domain-containing demethylases. Materials and Methods: The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of methylstat and doxorubicin on HL-60 cells were detected by MTT cell viability assay, double staining of treated cells with annexin-V/propidium iodide, and caspase-3 activity assay. Mitochondrial activity was analyzed using JC-1 dye. The expression levels of the BCL2 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes in HL-60 cells were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Lastly, the cytostatic effect was determined by cell cycle analysis. Results: In our research, cytotoxic, cytostatic, and apoptotic effects of methylstat on human HL-60 cells were investigated. Cytotoxic and cytostatic analyses revealed that methylstat decreased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent cytotoxic manner and arrested HL-60 cells in the G2/M and S phases. Methylstat also induced apoptosis through the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increases in caspase-3 enzyme activity. The expression levels of BCL2 and BCL2L1 were also decreased according to real-time PCR results. Finally, the combination of methylstat with doxorubicin resulted in synergistic cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate that methylstat may be a powerful candidate as a drug component of AML treatment protocols.",,"['Koca, Duygu', 'Hastar, Nurcan', 'Engur, Selin', 'Kiraz, Yagmur', 'Ulu, Gizem Tugce', 'Cekdemir, Demet', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Koca D', 'Hastar N', 'Engur S', 'Kiraz Y', 'Ulu GT', 'Cekdemir D', 'Baran Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6168-2891', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3147-3412', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3508-5617', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9265-9985', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1881-5166', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8354-780X']","['Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir, Turkey', 'Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir, Turkey', 'Anadolu University Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Eskisehir, Turkey', 'Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir, Turkey', 'Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir, Turkey', 'Sakarya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Sakarya, Turkey', 'Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir, Turkey']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191213,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*drug effects']",PMC7057756,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Methylstat', '*Jumonji C domain', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Histone methylation']",2019/12/14 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2019/12/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2019.0083 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2020 Feb 20;37(1):5-12. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2019.0083.

This has prompted increased interest regarding the coexistence of MPN and LPN. This review focuses on the role of JAK2 and the JAK/STAT pathway in MPN and LPN, whether there is a role for the genetic background in the occurrence of both MPN and LPN and whether there is a role for cytoreductive drugs in the occurrence of both MPN and LPN.

These lesions are believed to occur in response to friction between the epicardium and overlying pericardium. We investigated this lesion in adult cattle, a phenomenon that has been associated with bovine leukemia virus infection and epicardial lymphoma. We examined 73 hearts from adult cattle, predominantly of dairy breeds: 53 from a rendering facility and 20 from a state diagnostic laboratory. Cardiac mesothelial hyperplasia was much more prevalent in cattle than in other reported species (97% of examined hearts). The most common distribution was overlying the great vessels in a dark red papillary pattern. Cardiac mesothelial hyperplasia was also variably observed on all 4 cardiac chambers and the pericardium. Occasionally these lesions took on a smooth plaque-like appearance resembling those observed in humans. The lesions varied from 0.25 cm(2) to covering 90% of the epicardial surface.

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a web-based information tool and nurse delivered telephone support in reducing: (i) unmet information needs; (ii) depression; and (iii) anxiety, among hematological cancer patients and their support persons (SPs).Methods: Patients with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma and their SPs were enrolled in a prospective multi-site randomized trial. Participants received either access to an online information tool and telephone support from a hematology nurse, or usual care. Outcome data were collected 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-recruitment. The primary endpoint was unmet information needs.Results: Data from 60 patients and 15 SPs were included in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in unmet information needs, depression or anxiety between intervention and control groups for patients. Patients in both groups demonstrated a decrease in information needs over the intervention period. Post hoc analyses revealed that patients who did not achieve remission with the first cycle of treatment experienced increased anxiety from 4 weeks until the end of the study (p = 0.008).Conclusions: A web-based information tool and nurse delivered telephone support did not reduce unmet information needs, depression or anxiety among hematological cancer patients, however this finding is inconclusive given the low power of the study.Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: Patients who do not achieve remission are at high risk of anxiety, and may benefit from targeted

Accurate patient risk stratification based on genetic markers could increases survival rates. miRNAs can represent novel candidates with diagnostic, predictive and prognostic potential; however, many groups investigated their involvement with contradictory results. Aim: To clarify the role of miRNAs as biomarkers through a systematic review. Results: From a revision of 45 manuscripts, we found that miR-128 and miR-181 overexpression could represent markers for ALL diagnosis and underexpression of miR-708 and miR-99a could be markers for bad prognosis.

Correspondingly, hypomethylation of MIR-378 was also identified in AML, particularly for FAB-M2 subtype with t(8;21) chromosomal translocation. Nevertheless, the methylation status of MIR-378 has not been illustrated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Herein we designed to understand the methylation pattern of MIR-378 involved in MDS and clinical interrelation thereof. METHODS: Real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) was performed to evaluate the methylation degree of MIR-378 5'-flanking region on bone marrow mononuclear cells collected from 95 de novo MDS patients. Five gene mutations (IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, U2AF1, and SF3B1) were detected by high-resolution melting analysis to further evaluate the clinical relevance of hypomethylation of MIR-378. RESULTS: Unmethylated level of MIR-378 5'-flanking region was significantly higher in MDS patients than that in controls (p = .034). Hypomethylated MIR-378 was identified in 20 of 95 (21%) cases with MDS. Male patients appeared to be more frequent to harbor MIR-378 hypomethylation compared to female patients (15/55, 27.3% vs. 4/40, 10.0%, p = .04). There was no significant difference in age, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, hemoglobin concentration, and karyotypes between the patients with and without MIR-378-hypomethylation. Distinct distribution of five gene mutations was not observed in the two groups as well. However, MIR-378-hypomethylated patients had significantly shorter overall survival than those without MIR-378 hypomethylation (p = .036). Moreover, among patients <60 years, hypomethylation of MIR-378 was confirmed to be an independent adverse prognostic factor by both Kaplan-Meier and Multivariate Cox analyses. CONCLUSION: Hypomethylation of MIR-378 5'-flanking region is an adverse prognosticator in MDS, particularly in patients <60 years.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Furthermore, miRNAs, as a new paradigm of epigenetic regulators, play an important role in normal development and cellular function. This literature review summarizes the recurrent mechanism of gene regulation through miRNAs and, consequently, the impact of regulated genes on different cellular processes, including proliferation, metastasis, prognosis, and apoptosis. Additionally, what is important to note is that the expression of miRNAs in various cancer cells is different, and miRNAs have various target genes in various cancers. Accordingly, a proper understanding of gene regulation by miRNAs contributes to new perspectives in miRNA-based therapeutic strategies. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: MiRNAs are considered as a crucial regulator of gene expression. The genes also play an important role in the expression of miRNAs; as a result, there is a relationship between them. In recent years, targeted therapy with miRNAs has been a significant challenge. Studying the mechanisms through which miRNAs regulate various cancer cell processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, and metastasis, is very critical in the treatment of cancer through miRNAs. Definitely, a proper understanding of the impacts of aberrant expression of miRNAs on cancer cell processes leads to new therapeutic strategies in the targeted therapy with miRNAs.","['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Tapeh, Behnam Emamgolizadeh Gurt', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Tapeh BEG', 'Alivand MR', 'Solali S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6572-6564'],"['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood Banking, Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191212,England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'malignancy', 'miRNAs', 'pathogenesis']",2019/12/14 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2019/12/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.3466 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2020 Jun;38(4):334-346. doi: 10.1002/cbf.3466.

HU is currently used to treat leukemia, sickle cell anemia, psoriasis, and chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Although HU is easy to use and effective and has high tolerance, there have been numerous reports of cutaneous complications during long-term therapy with HU. CASE SUMMARY: We report a 67-year-old woman on long-term HU therapy for primary myelofibrosis who developed concurrent skin lesions during treatment. The first skin lesion appeared on the dorsum of her right hand in 2015. Despite continuous use of HU, her cutaneous changes were neglected. Approximately 3 years ago, she had multiple nodular and keratotic lesions on both hands with sharp margins, branny desquamation, and dotted hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, she developed acutely numerous ulcerative lesions on her hands and legs. Topical wound therapy with dressing changes and parenteral antibiotics was applied for management of the lesions. Most of the wounds healed after HU withdrawal. Lesions on both hands were replaced by scabs. Nevertheless, the wound on her left ankle reached 9 cm x 7 cm in size in January 2018. Pathology confirmed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma at the ulcer area. In addition, her left foot was severely affected and radical surgery with a below-the-knee amputation was suggested followed by preventive right groin nodal dissection. CONCLUSION: In patients receiving continuous HU therapy, close dermatologic follow-up is critical for the early diagnosis and selection of appropriate treatment for cutaneous lesions.","['(c)The Author(s) 2019.

It was previously shown that orotopically applied adrenergic vasoconstrictor prevented up to 100% of radiation-induced oral mucositis in two preclinical animal models. Methods: Adrenergic vasoconstrictor (i.e., phenylephrine in an aqueous-alcohol NG11-1 formulation) was orotopically applied to three patients (ages 24-29) who received the CY+TBI conditioning regimen; they were compared to five matched controls who received no orotopical vasoconstrictor. All patients received the CY+TBI conditioning regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia within the University of Wisconsin Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program. Over the seven-day Cy+TBI conditioning regimen, 20 min before each treatment, either radiation or chemotherapy, vasoconstrictor was applied topically to the oral cavity, and patients then received either 1.5 Gy whole-body radiation or IV cyclophosphamide. Results: OM severity was scored over a three-week period using: i) physican assessments, ii) daily photos of the oral cavity, iii) oral pain and oral function score sheets, and iv) recorded narcotic consumption. Both ""Grade 3 OM"" duration and ""any OM"" duration in vasoconstrictor-treated patients were substantially lower than for the five control patients. Though nasogastric tube or total parenteral nutrition were used in 3 out of 5 control patients, there was no use of these supportive care measures in the three vasoconstrictor-treated patients. Conclusion: Orotopically applied NG11-1 vasoconstrictor formulation substantially reduced the incidence and severity of ""Grade 3"" and ""any"" oral mucositis when compared to matched control patients, all of whom received the same CY+TBI conditioning regimen. The liquid orotopical formulation was easily tolerated by patients both in its ease of use and lack of side effects.",,"['Graul-Conroy, Amanda', 'Hoover-Regan, Margo', 'DeSantes, Kenneth B', 'Sondel, Paul M', 'Callander, Natalie S', 'Longo, Walter L', 'Fahl, William E']","['Graul-Conroy A', 'Hoover-Regan M', 'DeSantes KB', 'Sondel PM', 'Callander NS', 'Longo WL', 'Fahl WE']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Program, Baylor College of Medicine, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Bone Marrow Transplant Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Bone Marrow Transplant Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, USA.', 'Wisconsin Institutes of Medical Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.']",['eng'],['R03 CA176799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20181129,England,Integr Cancer Sci Ther,Integrative cancer science and therapeutics,101660140,,,,PMC6907163,['NIHMS1029638'],['NOTNLM'],"['cyclophosphamide', 'total body irradiation']",2019/12/14 06:00,2019/12/14 06:01,['2019/12/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15761/ICST.1000293 [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Cancer Sci Ther. 2018 Dec;5(6). doi: 10.15761/ICST.1000293.

Despite the many years of clinical use, the identity of the transporter(s) involved in the disposition of Ara-C remains poorly studied. Previous work demonstrated that concurrent administration of Ara-C with nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR) causes an increase in Ara-C plasma levels, suggesting involvement of one or more nucleoside transporters. Here, we confirmed the presence of an NMBPR-mediated interaction with Ara-C resulting in a 2.5-fold increased exposure. The interaction was unrelated to altered blood cell distribution, and subsequent studies indicated that the disposition of Ara-C was unaffected in mice with a deficiency of postulated candidate transporters, including ENT1, OCTN1, OATP1B2, and MATE1. These studies indicate the involvement of an unknown NBMPR-sensitive Ara-C transporter that impacts the pharmacokinetic properties of this clinically important agent.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Depending on the underlying cause of the disease, the conditioning regimens, source of the stem cells, and graft composition may vary. Possible stem cell donors are selected from databases considering existing major histocompatibility genes of the donor and the recipient. This is currently performed by matching human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -C for class I, as well as HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 for class II. Stem cell transplantation for nonmalignant disorders is a specialty of pediatrics. While algorithms for donor selection in these cases are generally similar, the objective of optimizing a possible graft-versus-leukemia effect is less important. In this article, we aim to provide an overview on the current methods for HLA typing and the algorithms for HLA matching. We also address ethical aspects regarding children and minors as stem cell donors.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by S.

Therefore, combination strategies with targeted therapies are urgently needed. Here, we discover that priming with SGI-110 (guadecitabine), a next-generation HMA, sensitizes AML cells to ASTX660, a novel antagonist of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2) and X-linked IAP (XIAP). Importantly, SGI-110 and ASTX660 synergistically induced cell death in a panel of AML cell lines as well as in primary AML samples while largely sparing normal CD34+ human progenitor cells, underlining the translational relevance of this combination. Unbiased transcriptome analysis revealed that SGI-110 alone or in combination with ASTX660 upregulated the expression of key regulators of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways such as TNFRSF10B (DR5), FAS, and BAX. Individual knockdown of the death receptors TNFR1, DR5, and FAS significantly reduced SGI-110/ASTX660-mediated cell death, whereas blocking antibodies for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or FAS ligand (FASLG) failed to provide protection. Also, TNFalpha-blocking antibody Enbrel had little protective effect on SGI-110/ASTX660-induced cell death. Further, SGI-110 and ASTX660 acted in concert to promote cleavage of caspase-8 and BID, thereby providing a link between extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Consistently, sequential treatment with SGI-110 and ASTX660-triggered loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and BAX activation which contributes to cell death, as BAX silencing significantly protected from SGI-110/ASTX660-mediated apoptosis. Together, these events culminated in the activation of caspases-3/-7, nuclear fragmentation, and cell death. In conclusion, SGI-110 and ASTX660 cooperatively induced apoptosis in AML cells by engaging extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this combination for AML.",,"['Dittmann, Jessica', 'Haydn, Tinka', 'Metzger, Patrick', 'Ward, George A', 'Boerries, Melanie', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Dittmann J', 'Haydn T', 'Metzger P', 'Ward GA', 'Boerries M', 'Vogler M', 'Fulda S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0459-6417'],"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), Albert Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, University Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, UK.', 'Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), Albert Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191212,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '2KT4YN1DP7 (guadecitabine)', '2LHZ9ZC3YO (ASTX-660)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC7244748,,,,2019/12/14 06:00,2021/09/09 06:00,['2019/12/14 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-019-0465-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-019-0465-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Jun;27(6):1878-1895. doi: 10.1038/s41418-019-0465-8.

In this study, we demonstrated that MLF2 may play an oncogenic role in CML. The expression level of MLF2 was related to the proliferation, colony-formation ability, and sensitivity to imatinib in K562 cells. Moreover, phosphorylation at serine 24, detected through Phos-tag sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was required to maintain the activity of MLF2 in CML. The effects of MLF2 overexpression on the colony-formation ability in vitro and mouse survival in vivo could be alleviated by point mutation of MLF2 at serine 24.

However, how NPM1c causes AML is not completely understood. NPM1 participates in multiple protein-protein interactions one of which involves the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Through binding of CTCF binding sites (CBS), CTCF mediates nuclear functions including DNA looping, regulation of gene expression, and RNA splicing. We hypothesized that mislocalization of CTCF into the cytoplasm by NPM1c reduces the functional level of nuclear CTCF and so alters gene expression. We verified the interaction of CTCF with NPM1 and showed that CTCF interacts with NPM1c, with redistribution of CTCF into the cytoplasm. The interaction of CTCF and NPM1c involves the amino terminus of CTCF and the last 50 amino acids of NPM1.

Molecular characterization and subtyping of T-ALL has begun to reveal vital insights into the complex biology of T-ALL and has prognostic and therapeutic implications. We present a case of a 19-year-old male who was found to have an early cortical phenotype T-ALL with multiple cytogenetic and somatic mutations including t(10;14) TLX-1 translocation, 9p22 CDKN2A deletion and missense mutations in PHF6, NOTCH-1, and FBXW7. Characterization of the significance of these mutations reveals that PHF6 mutations occur more frequently in adult males in association with TLX-1 translocations and early cortical phenotypes with NOTCH-1 activating mutations. We show mechanistically that these alterations occur in concert with one another to drive cell growth, cell survival and cell cycle progression.

Despite improvements in survival of CML patients, there are unique challenges in the Indian context. Indian patients present with more advanced disease. Most centers have access to imatinib as first-line therapy, but there is limited availability of molecular monitoring and second-line therapy. Most of the outcome data is retrospective and comparable with that reported in Western centers. Drug adherence is impaired in at least one third of patients and contributes to poor survival.

However, there remains a clear need to develop new strategies to target PI3K signaling. PI3K activity is countered by Src homology domain 2-containing inositol-5'-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) and, here, we have characterized the activity of a novel SHIP1 activator, AQX-435, in preclinical models of B-cell malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro activity of AQX-435 was evaluated using primary CLL cells and DLBCL-derived cell lines. In vivo activity of AQX-435, alone or in combination with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, was assessed using DLBCL cell line and patient-derived xenograft models. RESULTS: Pharmacologic activation of SHIP1 using AQX-435 was sufficient to inhibit anti-IgM-induced PI3K-mediated signaling, including induction of AKT phosphorylation and MYC expression, without effects on upstream SYK phosphorylation. AQX-435 also cooperated with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib to enhance inhibition of anti-IgM-induced AKT phosphorylation. AQX-435 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of CLL cells preferentially as compared with normal B cells, and overcame in vitro survival-promoting effects of microenvironmental stimuli. Finally, AQX-435 reduced AKT phosphorylation and growth of DLBCL in vivo and cooperated with ibrutinib for tumor growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Our results using AQX-435 demonstrate that SHIP1 activation may be an effective novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of B-cell neoplasms, alone or in combination with ibrutinib.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Lemm, Elizabeth A', 'Valle-Argos, Beatriz', 'Smith, Lindsay D', 'Richter, Johanna', 'Gebreselassie, Yohannes', 'Carter, Matthew J', 'Karolova, Jana', 'Svaton, Michael', 'Helman, Karel', 'Weston-Bell, Nicola J', 'Karydis, Laura', 'Williamson, Chris T', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Pettigrew, Jeremy', 'Harwig, Curtis', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Cragg, Mark', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Cross, Jennifer', 'Mackenzie, Lloyd', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Packham, Graham']","['Lemm EA', 'Valle-Argos B', 'Smith LD', 'Richter J', 'Gebreselassie Y', 'Carter MJ', 'Karolova J', 'Svaton M', 'Helman K', 'Weston-Bell NJ', 'Karydis L', 'Williamson CT', 'Lenz G', 'Pettigrew J', 'Harwig C', 'Stevenson FK', 'Cragg M', 'Forconi F', 'Steele AJ', 'Cross J', 'Mackenzie L', 'Klener P', 'Packham G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2043-0003', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3828-6000', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7141-8074', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0075-7276', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2077-089X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2211-1831', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0667-1596', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7786-9378']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Cancer Immunology, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP -

The frequent gain/loss of many chromosome bands in tumor cells and absence of mutations found at diagnosis suggests that NB is a copy number-driven cancer. Despite the previous work, a systematic analysis that investigates the relationship between such frequent gain/loss of chromosome bands and patient prognosis has yet to be implemented. METHODS: First, we analyzed two NB CNV datasets to select chromosomal bands with a high frequency of gain or loss. Second, we applied a computational approach to infer sample-specific CNVs for each chromosomal band selected in step 1 based on gene expression data. Third, we applied univariate Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between the resulting inferred copy number values (iCNVs) and patient survival. Finally, we applied multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to select chromosomal bands that remained significantly associated with prognosis after adjusting for critical clinical variables, including age, stage, gender, and MYCN amplification status. RESULTS: Here, we used a computational method to infer the copy number variations (CNVs) of sample-specific chromosome bands from NB patient gene expression profiles. The resulting inferred CNVs (iCNVs) were highly correlated with the experimentally determined CNVs, demonstrating CNVs can be accurately inferred from gene expression profiles. Using this iCNV metric, we identified 58 frequent gain/loss chromosome bands that were significantly associated with patient survival. Furthermore, we found that 7 chromosome bands were still significantly associated with patient survival even when clinical factors, such as MYCN status, were considered. Particularly, we found that the chromosome band chr11p14 has high potential as a novel candidate cytogenetic biomarker for clinical use. CONCLUSION: Our analysis resulted in a comprehensive list of prognostic chromosome bands supported by strong statistical evidence. In particular, the chr11p14 gain event provided additional prognostic value in addition to well-established clinical factors, including MYCN status, and thereby represents a novel candidate cytogenetic biomarker with high clinical potential. Additionally, this computational framework could be readily extended to other cancer types, such as leukemia.",,"['Qin, Chao', 'He, Xiaoyan', 'Zhao, Yanding', 'Tong, Chun-Yip', 'Zhu, Kenneth Y', 'Sun, Yongqi', 'Cheng, Chao']","['Qin C', 'He X', 'Zhao Y', 'Tong CY', 'Zhu KY', 'Sun Y', 'Cheng C']",,"['Beijing Key Lab of Traffic Data Analysis and Mining, School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, No.3 Shangyuancun, Beijing, 100044, Haidian District, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, BCM451, Suite 100D, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, 400014, China."", 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, 03766, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, BCM451, Suite 100D, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, USA.', 'Beijing Key Lab of Traffic Data Analysis and Mining, School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, No.3 Shangyuancun, Beijing, 100044, Haidian District, China. yqsun@bjtu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, BCM451, Suite 100D, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. chao.cheng@bcm.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA227996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR001088/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191212,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC6909636,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chr11p14', '*Chr11q23', '*Cytogenetic marker', '*Neuroblastoma', '*Prognosis']",2019/12/14 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/12/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-019-0620-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-019-0620-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Dec 12;12(1):192. doi: 10.1186/s12920-019-0620-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study evaluates the anti-cancer and anti-proliferative properties of Annona cherimola ethanolic leaf extract (AELE) on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell lines cultured in vitro (Monomac-1 and KG-1). METHODS: The anti-proliferative effect of A. cherimola ethanolic leaf extract was evaluated via cell viability assay. Its pro-apoptotic effect was assessed through Cell Death ELISA and dual Annexin V/PI staining. To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which the extract promoted apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of the AML cells used, apoptotic protein expression was determined through western blots. Extract composition was elucidated by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: Our results showed that the treatment with A. cherimola ethanolic leaf extract exhibited an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of both cancer cell lines used in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with no toxic effects on normal mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from human bone marrow. This effect was mediated by DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, as revealed by Cell Death ELISA and dual Annexin V/PI staining.

Accumulating evidence has implicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in atherosclerosis. This study aims to clarify the potential effects of lncRNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) on cholesterol reverse-transport and intracellular lipid accumulation in atherosclerosis. GAS5 was mainly localized in the nucleus and highly expressed in the human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) macrophage-derived foam cells in coronary heart disease. Overexpressed GAS5 increased THP-1 macrophage lipid accumulation. Of note, GAS5 can inhibit the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) by binding to enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Overexpression of EZH2 reduced cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression. EZH2 promoted triple methylation of lysine 27 (H3K27) in the ABCA1 promoter region. Subjected to overexpressed GAS5, overexpressed EZH2, or downregulated ABCA1, the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)(-/-) mice with atherosclerosis showed increased total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, aortic plaque, and lipid accumulation, accompanied by reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level and cholesterol outflow. Altogether, knockdown of GAS5 can potentially promote reverse-transportation of cholesterol and inhibit intracellular lipid accumulation, ultimately preventing the progression of atherosclerosis via reducing EZH2-mediated transcriptional inhibition of ABCA1 by histone methylation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles and molecular events of ANRIL associated with AML progression. METHODS: Expression patterns of ANRIL and miR-34a in the bone marrow (BM) samples and cell lines were determined using qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of cells with ANRIL knockdown or miR-34a overexpression were assessed by CCK-8, EdU staining, flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the relationship between miR-34a and Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). The binding of E2 F1 (E2 F transcription factor 1) with gene promoter was analyzed by ChIP. Furthermore, the tumorigenicity of AML was determined by xenograft transplantation in nude mice. RESULTS: ANRIL was up-regulated both in the BM samples from AML patients and cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1), of which expression was negatively correlated with miR-34a expression. ANRIL knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis of AML cells, while overexpression of miR-34a exerted opposite effects. miR-34a was verified as a downstream gene targeted by ANRIL. Moreover, HDAC1 was a direct target of miR-34a, and HDAC1 overexpression impaired the recruitment of E2 F1 to ASPP2 (apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53) gene promoter. ANRIL knockdown significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis of AML. CONCLUSION: ANRIL promotes AML development through HDAC1-mediated epigenetic suppression of ASPP2 via negatively regulating miR-34a, which might serve as a therapeutic target for AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Quantitative assessment of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene transcripts was performed using real-time PCR method. The bone marrow samples were collected at the time of diagnosis for 47 APL patients, and for 31/47 patients during follow-up/relapse of the disease (129 samples in total). We examined how this molecular marker can be used for prognosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. RESULTS: Increased WT1 expression was found in 34% of patients. WT1(high) status was an independent unfavorable factor for early death occurrence and was associated with shorter overall survival (OS). Assessment of log reduction value of WT1 expression in paired diagnosis/complete remission samples did not reveal its impact on relapse rate, disease-free survival, and OS. Also, measurement of WT1 expression level at different time points during therapy was not a reliable method for MRD monitoring.

Better understanding of mechanisms influencing CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and the potential for modulation using small-molecule drugs could improve current immunotherapies. Here, we systematically investigated druggable mechanisms of CAR T-cell cytotoxicity using >500 small-molecule drugs and genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens. We identified several tyrosine kinase inhibitors that inhibit CAR T-cell cytotoxicity by impairing T-cell signaling transcriptional activity. In contrast, the apoptotic modulator drugs SMAC mimetics sensitized B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells to anti-CD19 CAR T cells. CRISPR screens identified death receptor signaling through FADD and TNFRSF10B (TRAIL-R2) as a key mediator of CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and elucidated the RIPK1-dependent mechanism of sensitization by SMAC mimetics. Death receptor expression varied across genetic subtypes of B-cell malignancies, suggesting a link between mechanisms of CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and cancer genetics.

However, other steps in virus replication that can be targeted by mA3 have not been examined. We have investigated the possible effect of mA3 on MuLV protease-mediated processes and found that mA3 binds both mature viral protease and Pr180gag-pol precursor polyprotein. Using replication-competent MuLVs, we also show that mA3 inhibits the processing of Pr65 Gag precursor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the autoprocessing of Pr180gag-pol is impeded by mA3, resulting in reduced production of mature viral protease. This reduction appears to link with the above inefficient Pr65gag processing in the presence of mA3. Two major isoforms of mA3, exon 5-containing and -lacking ones, equally exhibit this antiviral activity.

In this study, CRLF2 mRNA expression levels and clinical and laboratory parameters in 63 pediatric T-ALL patients were detected at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Children's Hospital of Xianyang between February 2015 and June 2018. The patients were treated according to the modified St. Jude TXV ALL protocol, and early treatment responses (bone marrow smear and MRD level) and prognoses in the enrolled patients were assessed. CRLF2 overexpression was detected in 21/63 (33.33%) patients. Statistical differences were not found for clinical or laboratory parameters (including sex, age, initial WBC count, incidence mediastinal involvement, abnormal karyotype and fusion genes) between patients with high CRLF2 expression and patients with low expression of CRLF2 (P>0.05). One patient died of tumor lysis syndrome and renal failure, and the treatment response was monitored on day 19 (TP1) of remission in 62 patients. One patient quit treatment because of family decisions, and 61 patients underwent treatment response evaluation on day 46 (TP2) of remission. Significant differences were not found between patients with high CRLF2 expression and patients with low CRLF2 expression in terms of the treatment responses at TP1 or TP2 (P>0.05). Following October 2018, 12 patients among the 61 evaluable patients relapsed (relapse rate: 19.67%), 3 patients died from chemotherapy, and the treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate was 4.92%. Secondary tumors occurred in 1 patient. The 3-year prospective EFS rate was 54.1+/-11.2% and 77.7+/-6.6% for the 61 evaluable patients and 58 patients without TRM. Patients with low CRLF2 expression had longer EFS durations than patients with high CRLF2 expression (61 evaluable patients: 35.91+/- 2.38 months vs 23.43+/- 2.57 months; 58 patients without TRM: 37.86+/- 2.08 months vs 24.55+/-2.43 months, P<0.05). CRLF2 expression levels were also monitored in 13 patients at TP1 and TP2, and the MRD level did not vary with the CRLF2 expression level. Our data suggest that clinical features, laboratory findings and treatment responses in the pediatric T-ALL population do not vary based on the overexpression of CRLF2 but that CRLF2 overexpression can contribute to a high risk of relapse in pediatric T-ALL. Thus, CRLF2 expression levels should not be used as biomarkers for monitoring MRD.",,"['Wang, Mingmin', 'Wen, Jinquan', 'Guo, Yuxia', 'Shen, Yali', 'An, Xizhou', 'Hu, Yanni', 'Xiao, Jianwen']","['Wang M', 'Wen J', 'Guo Y', 'Shen Y', 'An X', 'Hu Y', 'Xiao J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8322-9286'],"[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P.R.

Therapeutic leukocytapheresis using an automatic cell separator can help to achieve prompt leukoreduction to reduce the rate of thrombotic events and early mortality as well as to prevent tumor lysis syndrome. AIM: In this study, we report a single center's experience in managing leukemia patients with therapeutic leukocytapheresis prior to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukocytapheresis procedures were performed in 192 leukemia patients (including acute myeloid leukemia [AML], acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], and chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]) with hyperleukocytosis between January and December 2016. RESULTS: Median % reduction of white blood cell (WBC) count was 30.5% and median % removal efficiency was 46.7% for 75 procedures where the waste bag was sampled. WBC removal efficiency strongly depended on diagnosis (and was 71%, 66%, and 39% for ALL, AML, and CML, respectively). Procedures were generally well tolerated with only 9 out of 192 patients having mild adverse effects. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In the absence of specific guidelines for the management of hyperleukocytosis, leukocytapheresis in association with chemotherapy should be considered early in clinical practice.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Nguyen, Thanh H', 'Bach, Khanh Q', 'Vu, Hung Q', 'Nguyen, Nhat Q', 'Duong, Thien D', 'De Reys, Stef', 'Wheeler, Jennifer']","['Nguyen TH', 'Bach KQ', 'Vu HQ', 'Nguyen NQ', 'Duong TD', 'De Reys S', 'Wheeler J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4884-0522'],"['National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Terumo BCT, Lakewood, Colorado.', 'Terumo BCT, Lakewood, Colorado.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191212,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Leukocytosis/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'hyperleukocytosis']",2019/12/13 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2019/12/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21766 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2020 Apr;35(2):117-124. doi: 10.1002/jca.21766.

It is rich in nutrients and polyphenols. The plant also has been traditionally used for alleviating allergic conditions. This study was aimed to examine the anti-allergic activity of M. oleifera extracts and its isolated compounds. METHOD: M. oleifera leaves, seeds and pods were extracted with 80% of ethanol. Individual compounds were isolated using a column chromatographic technique and elucidated based on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESIMS) spectral data. The anti-allergic activity of the extracts, isolated compounds and ketotifen fumarate as a positive control was evaluated using rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells for early and late phases of allergic reactions. The early phase was determined based on the inhibition of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine release; while the late phase was based on the inhibition of interleukin (IL-4) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) release. RESULTS: Two new compounds; ethyl-(E)-undec-6-enoate (1) and 3,5,6-trihydroxy-2-(2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one (2) together with six known compounds; quercetin (3), kaempferol (4), beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucoside (5), oleic acid (6), glucomoringin (7), 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde (8) and stigmasterol (9) were isolated from M. oleifera extracts. All extracts and the isolated compounds inhibited mast cell degranulation by inhibiting beta-hexosaminidase and histamine release, as well as the release of IL-4 and TNF-alpha at varying levels compared with ketotifen fumarate. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that M. oleifera and its isolated compounds potentially have an anti-allergic activity by inhibiting both early and late phases of allergic reactions.",,"['Abd Rani, Nur Zahirah', 'Kumolosasi, Endang', 'Jasamai, Malina', 'Jamal, Jamia Azdina', 'Lam, Kok Wai', 'Husain, Khairana']","['Abd Rani NZ', 'Kumolosasi E', 'Jasamai M', 'Jamal JA', 'Lam KW', 'Husain K']",,"['Drug and Herbal Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Drug and Herbal Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Drug and Herbal Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Drug and Herbal Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Drug and Herbal Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Drug and Herbal Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, 50300, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. khairana@ukm.edu.my.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191211,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Fruit/chemistry', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects', '*Moringa oleifera', 'Plant Extracts/analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Rats']",PMC6907282,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-allergic', 'Beta-hexosaminidase', 'Histamine', 'IL-4', 'Isolation', 'Moringa oleifera', 'New compound', 'RBL-2H3', 'TNF- alpha']",2019/12/13 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2019/12/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12906-019-2776-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-019-2776-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2019 Dec 11;19(1):361. doi: 10.1186/s12906-019-2776-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next generation sequencing has helped to increase our knowledge of the disease pathogenesis, allowing us to develop targeted and possibly more effective treatment options. Seven new agents have been approved for the treatment of AML since 2017, all of which are directed toward a specific molecular subtype or patient population.

We aimed to investigate the effects of Nrf2 on drug sensitivity, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptosis induction in imatinib-resistant CML K562/G01 cells and explored their potential mechanisms. Stable K562/G01 cells with knockdown of Nrf2 were established by infection of siRNA-expressing lentivirus. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Nrf2 and TrxR were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. ROS generation and apoptosis were assayed by flow cytometry, while drug sensitivity was measured by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cells had higher levels of Nrf2 expression than the parental K562 cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Expression levels of Nrf2 and TrxR were positively correlated in K562/G01 cells. Knockdown of Nrf2 in K562/G01 cells enhanced the intracellular ROS level, suppressed cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis in response to imatinib treatments. Nrf2 expression contributes to the imatinib resistance of K562/G01 cells and is positively correlated with TrxR expression. Targeted inhibition of the Nrf2-TrxR axis represents a potential therapeutic approach for imatinib-resistant CML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Lianrong Xu et al.'],"['Xu, Lianrong', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Pan, Fei', 'Zhu, Mengxia', 'Yao, Liqin', 'Liu, Yan', 'Feng, Jiangfang', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Chen, Xiuhua', 'Ren, Fanggang', 'Tan, Yanhong', 'Wang, Hongwei']","['Xu L', 'Zhao Y', 'Pan F', 'Zhu M', 'Yao L', 'Liu Y', 'Feng J', 'Xiong J', 'Chen X', 'Ren F', 'Tan Y', 'Wang H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5279-6421', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2902-591X']","['Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191118,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', '*K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC6885806,,,,2019/12/13 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2019/12/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/6502793 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Nov 18;2019:6502793. doi: 10.1155/2019/6502793. eCollection 2019.,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the downregulation of antiapoptotic BAG3 and MCL-1 occurred in J/Neo cells but not in J/BCL-XL cells overexpressing BCL-XL. Additionally, several BCL-XL-sensitive intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic events including apoptotic sub-G1 cell accumulation, TUNEL-positive DNA fragmentation, BAK activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) loss, caspase-9/caspase-8/caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage were induced only in J/Neo cells. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS levels were elevated in quercetin-treated J/Neo cells; however, the ROS elevations were almost completely abrogated in J/BCL-XL cells, suggesting the ROS elevations were downstream of BCL-XL-sensitive mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Wild-type A3, FADD-deficient I2.1, and caspase-8-deficient I9.2 Jurkat clones exhibited similar susceptibilities to the cytotoxicity of quercetin, excluding an involvement of extrinsic pathway in triggering the apoptosis. The autophagic events such as attenuation of AKT-mTOR pathway, formation of acridine orange-stainable acidic vesicular organelles, conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-I (LC3-I) to LC3-II, and downregulation of p62/SQSTM1 level were detected in quercetin-treated J/Neo and J/BCL-XL cells, regardless of BCL-XL overexpression. Cotreatment with the autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, LY294002, or chloroquine) resulted in a significant enhancement of quercetin-induced BAK activation and subsequently the mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis pathway by augmenting the downregulation of BAG3 and MCL-1 levels in J/Neo cells. These results demonstrated that quercetin induces intrinsic apoptosis and cytoprotective autophagy, and autophagy inhibition can potentiate BAK-dependent apoptotic activity of quercetin in Jurkat T cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Eun Ji Ha et al.'],"['Ha, Eun Ji', 'Kim, Ki Yun', 'Kim, Chae Eun', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Ha EJ', 'Kim KY', 'Kim CE', 'Jun DY', 'Kim YH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8827-8311'],"['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Astrogen Inc., Techno-Building 313, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191115,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",PMC6885204,,,,2019/12/13 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/12/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/7989276 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2019 Nov 15;2019:7989276. doi: 10.1155/2019/7989276. eCollection 2019.,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antioxidant properties of Polyalthia longifolia plant are well established. In our previous work, we demonstrated the presence of cytotoxic compounds in the methanol extract of Polyalthia longifolia (MEP) with potent activity against human leukemia cells. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of MEP against prostate cancer (PCa) and established the molecular basis of its effect in in vitro and in vivo models. We observed that MEP treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the growth and viability of PCa cells, associated with arrest in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Apoptosis was confirmed as the primary mode of MEP-induced cell death through activation of the intrinsic apoptotic machinery. Proteomic and biochemical studies identified BiP as an important target of MEP with the activation of the ER stress pathway, as a potential mechanism driving MEP-induced apoptosis. The extract exhibited strong efficacy in the PCa xenograft mouse model with significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced tumor burden. Taken together, our findings indicate that MEP-induced apoptosis in PCa cells concomitant with the activation of the ER stress pathways results in the inhibition of tumor growth, in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide initial evidence of the efficacy of MEP against PCa and advocate for in-depth studies in other preclinical models for its possible use in clinical settings.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Saheed O.

Here, we describe an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that progressed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in association with acquisition of 1q JTs. The sequence of molecular and cytogenetic changes in our patient may provide a mechanistic model for the generation of JTs in leukemia. Case presentation: A 68-year-old man presented with pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed a hypercellular marrow with multilineage dysplasia, consistent with MDS, with no increase in blasts. Karyotype and MDS fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel were normal. Repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy after 8 cycles of azacitidine, with persistent pancytopenia, showed no changes in morphology, and karyotype was again normal. Myeloid mutation panel showed mutations in RUNX1, SRSF2, ASXL1, and TET2. Three years after diagnosis, he developed AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Karyotype was abnormal, with unbalanced 1q JTs to the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes 14 and 21, leading to gain of 1q. Conclusions: Our patient had MDS with pathogenic mutations of the RUNX1, SRSF2, ASXL1, and TET2 genes and developed 1q JTs at the time of progression from MDS to AML.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the roots of Cnidium officinale Makino (CoM) on endometrial receptivity in both in vitro and in vivo model of embryo implantation. We found that CoM enhanced the adhesion of JAr cells to Ishikawa cells by stimulating expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrins. In addition, blocking of LIFR using hLA or neutralization of integrins alphaV, beta3, and beta5 using antibodies significantly reduced the enhanced adhesion between JAr cell and CoM-treated Ishikawa cells, indicating that LIF and integrin play an important role in trophoblast-endometrium adhesion for embryo implantation. Furthermore, we identified that CoM significantly improved the implantation rate of blastocysts in the mouse model of RU-induced implantation failure. By collecting these results, here, we suggest that CoM has a therapeutic potential against female infertility associated with decreased endometrial receptivity.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Tae-Wook Chung et al.'],"['Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Park, Mi-Ju', 'Lee, Hoyoung', 'Kim, Keuk-Jun', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho', 'Choi, Hee-Jung', 'Ha, Ki-Tae']","['Chung TW', 'Park MJ', 'Lee H', 'Kim KJ', 'Kim CH', 'Choi HJ', 'Ha KT']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5243-5020', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2092-8696', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5190-0904', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6323-0714', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1285-2318', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6283-0171']","['Department of Korean Medical Science, School of Korean Medicine and Healthy Aging Korean Medical Research Center, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Korean Medical Science, School of Korean Medicine and Healthy Aging Korean Medical Research Center, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, DaeKyeung University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Kyunggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Korean Medical Science, School of Korean Medicine and Healthy Aging Korean Medical Research Center, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Korean Medical Science, School of Korean Medicine and Healthy Aging Korean Medical Research Center, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191116,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC6885254,,,,2019/12/13 06:00,2019/12/13 06:01,['2019/12/13 06:00'],"['2019/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/7560631 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2019 Nov 16;2019:7560631. doi: 10.1155/2019/7560631. eCollection 2019.,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the discovery of the most frequent cytogenomic drivers of disease during the last decade, new efforts are needed in order to improve prognostication. In this study, we used gene expression data of CLL samples in order to discover novel transcriptomic patterns associated with patient survival. We observed that a 3-gene expression signature composed of SCGB2A1, KLF4, and PPP1R14B differentiate a group of circa 5% of cases with short survival. This effect was independent of the main cytogenetic markers of adverse prognosis. Finally, this finding was reproduced in an independent retrospective cohort.

They mostly consist in heterozygous missense mutations targeting a hotspot site at R882 codon, which exhibit a dominant negative effect and are associated with high myeloblast count, advanced age, and poor prognosis. Other types of mutations such as truncations, insertions, or single-nucleotide deletion also affect the DNMT3A gene, though with lower frequency. The present study aimed to characterize two DNMT3A gene mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS), through analysis of protein stability and DNA methylation status at CpG islands. The first mutation was a single-nucleotide variant of DNMT3A at exon 20 causing a premature STOP codon (c.2385G > A; p.Trp795 ( *) ; NM_022552.4). The DNMT3A mutation load increased from 4.5% to 38.2% during guadecitabine treatment, with a dominant negative effect on CpG methylation and on protein expression. The second mutation was a novel insertion of 35 nucleotides in exon 22 of DNMT3A (NM_022552.4) that introduced a STOP codon too, after the amino acid Glu863 caused by a frameshift insertion (c.2586_2587insTCATGAATGAGAAAGAGGACATCTTATGGTGCACT; p. Thr862_Glu863fsins). The mutation, which was associated with reduced DNMT3A expression and CpG methylation, persisted at relapse with minor changes in the methylation profile and at protein level. Our data highlight the need to better understand the consequences of DNMT3A mutations other than R882 substitutions in the leukemogenic process in order to tailor patient treatments, thus avoiding therapeutic resistance and disease relapse.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Samantha Bruno et al.'],"['Bruno, Samantha', 'Bochicchio, Maria Teresa', 'Franchini, Eugenia', 'Padella, Antonella', 'Marconi, Giovanni', 'Ghelli Luserna di Rora, Andrea', 'Venturi, Claudia', 'Raffini, Maddalena', 'Prisinzano, Giovanna', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Bandini, Lorenza', 'Robustelli, Valentina', 'Pazzaglia, Martina', 'Fontana, Maria Chiara', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Abbenante, Maria Chiara', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Bruno S', 'Bochicchio MT', 'Franchini E', 'Padella A', 'Marconi G', 'Ghelli Luserna di Rora A', 'Venturi C', 'Raffini M', 'Prisinzano G', 'Ferrari A', 'Bandini L', 'Robustelli V', 'Pazzaglia M', 'Fontana MC', 'Sartor C', 'Abbenante MC', 'Papayannidis C', 'Soverini S', 'Ottaviani E', 'Simonetti G', 'Martinelli G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6954-969X'],"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

Due to the current high engraftment rates, the low incidence of graft-vs.-host disease and regimen related mortality, transplantation from haploidentical donors have been progressively offered even to elderly patients.

Here we use an in vivo pooled CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis screening approach to demonstrate that, by targeting REGNASE-1, CD8(+) T cells are reprogrammed to long-lived effector cells with extensive accumulation, better persistence and robust effector function in tumours. REGNASE-1-deficient CD8(+) T cells show markedly improved therapeutic efficacy against mouse models of melanoma and leukaemia. By using a secondary genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identify BATF as the key target of REGNASE-1 and as a rheostat that shapes antitumour responses. Loss of BATF suppresses the increased accumulation and mitochondrial fitness of REGNASE-1-deficient CD8(+) T cells. By contrast, the targeting of additional signalling factors-including PTPN2 and SOCS1-improves the therapeutic efficacy of REGNASE-1-deficient CD8(+) T cells.

Various epigenetic therapies aimed at reversing these hallmarks of AML have progressed into clinical trials, but most show only modest efficacy owing to an inability to effectively eradicate leukaemia stem cells (LSCs)(1). Here, to specifically identify novel dependencies in LSCs, we screened a bespoke library of small hairpin RNAs that target chromatin regulators in a unique ex vivo mouse model of LSCs. We identify the MYST acetyltransferase HBO1 (also known as KAT7 or MYST2) and several known members of the HBO1 protein complex as critical regulators of LSC maintenance. Using CRISPR domain screening and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified the histone acetyltransferase domain of HBO1 as being essential in the acetylation of histone H3 at K14. H3 acetylated at K14 (H3K14ac) facilitates the processivity of RNA polymerase II to maintain the high expression of key genes (including Hoxa9 and Hoxa10) that help to sustain the functional properties of LSCs. To leverage this dependency therapeutically, we developed a highly potent small-molecule inhibitor of HBO1 and demonstrate its mode of activity as a competitive analogue of acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of HBO1 phenocopied our genetic data and showed efficacy in a broad range of human cell lines and primary AML cells from patients. These biological, structural and chemical insights into a therapeutic target in AML will enable the clinical translation of these findings.",,"['MacPherson, Laura', 'Anokye, Juliana', 'Yeung, Miriam

The expression of MCL-1 is maintained via P-TEFb-mediated transcription, where the kinase CDK9 is a critical component. Consequently, we developed a series of potent small-molecule inhibitors of CDK9, exemplified by the orally active A-1592668, with CDK selectivity profiles that are distinct from related molecules that have been extensively studied clinically. Short-term treatment with A-1592668 rapidly downregulates RNA pol-II (Ser 2) phosphorylation resulting in the loss of MCL-1 protein and apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent hematologic tumor cell lines. This cell death could be attenuated by either inhibiting caspases or overexpressing BCL-2 protein. Synergistic cell killing was also observed between A-1592668 or the related analog A-1467729, and venetoclax in a number of hematologic cell lines and primary NHL patient samples. Importantly, the CDK9 inhibitor plus venetoclax combination was well tolerated in vivo and demonstrated efficacy superior to either agent alone in mouse models of lymphoma and AML. These data indicate that CDK9 inhibitors could be highly efficacious in tumors that depend on MCL-1 for survival or when used in combination with venetoclax in malignancies dependent on MCL-1 and BCL-2.",,"['Phillips, Darren C', 'Jin, Sha', 'Gregory, Gareth P', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Xue, John', 'Zhao, Xiaoxian', 'Chen, Jun', 'Tong, Yunsong', 'Zhang, Haichao', 'Smith, Morey', 'Tahir, Stephen K', 'Clark, Rick F', 'Penning, Thomas D', 'Devlin, Jennifer R', 'Shortt, Jake', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Albert, Daniel H', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Souers, Andrew J']","['Phillips DC', 'Jin S', 'Gregory GP', 'Zhang Q', 'Xue J', 'Zhao X', 'Chen J', 'Tong Y', 'Zhang H', 'Smith M', 'Tahir SK', 'Clark RF', 'Penning TD', 'Devlin JR', 'Shortt J', 'Hsi ED', 'Albert DH', 'Konopleva M', 'Johnstone RW', 'Leverson JD', 'Souers AJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4170-0682'],"['Oncology-Discovery, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA. darren.phillips@abbvie.com.', 'Oncology-Discovery, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Translational Hematology Program, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, VIC, 3000, Australia.', 'Blood Cancer Therapeutics Laboratory, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, 246 Clayton Rd, Clayton, VIC, 3168, Australia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Oncology-Discovery, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL, 60064, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Robert J.

We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of U2AF1 mutations on MDS progression. METHODS: Two reviewers independently extracted information such as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) as well as the number of surviving patients each year after diagnosis from the included studies. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with a total of 3038 patients were included. The summary odds ratio (OR) for U2AF1 mutations with an OS of 5 years was 0.37, the summary HR for U2AF1 mutations in OS was 1.60, and the summary OR for an OS of 5 years in patients with U2AF1(S34) and U2AF1(Q157) was 3.68. There were no significant differences in leukemia-free survival or hypomethylating therapy response between patients with and without U2AF1 mutations. CONCLUSION: U2AF1 mutations were associated with poor survival in MDS patients, and patients with U2AF1(Q157) had a worse OS than those with U2AF1(S34). Our findings suggest that MDS patients with U2AF1 mutations could benefit more from hypomethylation therapy.",,"['Li, Bixia', 'Zou, Duobing', 'Yang, Shujun', 'Ouyang, Guifang', 'Mu, Qitian']","['Li B', 'Zou D', 'Yang S', 'Ouyang G', 'Mu Q']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3411-3666'],"['Ningbo University, Ningbo, P.

Asciminib targets both native and mutated BCR-ABL1, including the gatekeeper T315I mutant. The safety and antileukemic activity of asciminib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia are unknown. METHODS: In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, we enrolled 141 patients with chronic-phase and 9 with accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from at least two previous ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose (or both) of asciminib. Asciminib was administered once or twice daily (at doses of 10 to 200 mg). The median follow-up was 14 months. RESULTS: Patients were heavily pretreated; 70% (105 of 150 patients) had received at least three TKIs. The maximum tolerated dose of asciminib was not reached. Among patients with chronic-phase CML, 34 (92%) with a hematologic relapse had a complete hematologic response; 31 (54%) without a complete cytogenetic response at baseline had a complete cytogenetic response. A major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 48% of patients who could be evaluated, including 8 of 14 (57%) deemed to have resistance to or unacceptable side effects from ponatinib. A major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 5 patients (28%) with a T315I mutation at baseline. Clinical responses were durable; a major molecular response was maintained in 40 of 44 patients. Dose-limiting toxic effects included asymptomatic elevations in the lipase level and clinical pancreatitis. Common adverse events included fatigue, headache, arthralgia, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Asciminib was active in heavily pretreated patients with CML who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from TKIs, including patients in whom ponatinib had failed and those with a T315I mutation.

By combining whole-exome sequencing and comparative global proteomic investigations, we found a large deletion in the ABCC4/MRP4 gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in PEL-negative individuals. The loss of PEL expression on ABCC4-CRISPR-Cas9 K562 cells and its overexpression in ABCC4-transfected cells provided evidence that ABCC4 is the gene underlying the PEL blood group antigen. Although ABCC4 is an important cyclic nucleotide exporter, red blood cells from ABCC4null/PEL-negative individuals exhibited a normal guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate level, suggesting a compensatory mechanism by other erythroid ABC transporters. Interestingly, PEL-negative individuals showed an impaired platelet aggregation, confirming a role for ABCC4 in platelet function.

In this study, we compared outcomes of AML patients >60 years of age undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at our institution. All 404 consecutively treated patients received 1 of the following conditioning regimens: (1) fludarabine+melphalan 100 mg/m2 (FM100), (2) fludarabine+melphalan 140 mg/m2 (FM140), (3) fludarabine+IV busulfan AUC >/= 5000/d x 4 d (Bu>/=20000), and (4) fludarabine+IV busulfan AUC 4000/d x 4 d (Bu16000). A propensity score analysis (PSA) was used to compare outcomes between these 4 groups. Among the 4 conditioning regimens, the FM100 group had a significantly better long-term survival with 5-year progression-free survival of 49% vs 30%, 34%, and 23%, respectively. The benefit of the FM100 regimen resulted primarily from the lower nonrelapse mortality associated with this regimen, an effect more pronounced in patients with lower performance status. The PSA confirmed that FM100 was associated with better posttransplantation survival, whereas no significant differences were seen between the other regimen groups. In summary, older patients with AML benefited from a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with lower melphalan doses (FM100), which was associated with better survival, even though it was primarily used in patients who could not receive a more intense conditioning regimen.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Varma, Ankur', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Srour, Samer', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Mehta, Rohtesh', 'Oran, Betul', 'Popat, Uday', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Olson, Amanda', 'Daver, Naval', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Ciurea SO', 'Kongtim P', 'Varma A', 'Rondon G', 'Chen J', 'Srour S', 'Bashir Q', 'Alousi A', 'Mehta R', 'Oran B', 'Popat U', 'Hosing C', 'Olson A', 'Daver N', 'Konopleva M', 'Champlin RE']",,"['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",PMC8212356,,,,2019/12/12 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62262-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003662 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Feb 6;135(6):449-452. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003662.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations defined 4 distinct FLT3-ITD genotypes based on the ITD AR and the NPM1 mutational status. In this retrospective exploratory study, we investigated the prognostic and predictive impact of the NPM1/FLT3-ITD genotypes categorized according to the 2017 ELN risk groups in patients randomized within the RATIFY trial, which evaluated the addition of midostaurin to standard chemotherapy. The 4 NPM1/FLT3-ITD genotypes differed significantly with regard to clinical and concurrent genetic features. Complete ELN risk categorization could be done in 318 of 549 trial patients with FLT3-ITD AML. Significant factors for response after 1 or 2 induction cycles were ELN risk group and white blood cell (WBC) counts; treatment with midostaurin had no influence. Overall survival (OS) differed significantly among ELN risk groups, with estimated 5-year OS probabilities of 0.63, 0.43, and 0.33 for favorable-, intermediate-, and adverse-risk groups, respectively (P < .001). A multivariate Cox model for OS using allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission as a time-dependent variable revealed treatment with midostaurin, allogeneic HCT, ELN favorable-risk group, and lower WBC counts as significant favorable factors.

The rationale was brought up by the observation of the revertant of SCIDX1 and ADA deficiency as a kind of natural gene therapy. Nevertheless, the first attempts of gene therapy for SCID X1 were associated with insertional mutagenesis causing leukemia, because the viral enhancer induced transactivation of oncogenes. Removal of this element and use of a promoter instead led to safer but still efficacious gene therapy. It was observed that a fully diversified T cell repertoire could be generated by a limited set (<1,000) of progenitor cells. Further advances in gene transfer technology, including the use of lentiviral vectors, has led to success in the treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, while further applications are pending.

RUNX1-ETO is found in 10-15% of acute myeloid leukemia and interferes with the expression of genes that are essential for myeloid differentiation. The neutrophil serine protease Cathepsin G is one of the genes suppressed by RUNX1-ETO, but little is known about its impact on the regulation of other lysosomal proteases. By lentiviral transduction of the t(8;21) positive cell line Kasumi-1 with an RUNX1-ETO specific shRNA, we analyzed long-term effects of stable RUNX1-ETO silencing on cellular phenotypes and target gene expression. Stable anti RUNX1-ETO RNAi reduces both proliferation and apoptosis in Kasumi-1 cells. In addition, long-term knockdown of RUNX1-ETO leads to an upregulation of proteolytic activity in Kasumi-1 cells, which may be released in vitro upon cell lysis leading to massive degradation of cellular proteins. We therefore propose that protein expression data of RUNX1-ETO-silenced Kasumi-1 cells must be analyzed with caution, as cell lysis conditions can heavily influence the results of studies on protein expression. Next, a mass spectrometry-based approach was used to identify protease cleavage patterns in RUNX1-ETO-depleted Kasumi-1 cells and Neutrophil Elastase has been identified as a RUNX1-ETO candidate target.

Here, we enlarge this map to include normal NKL homeobox gene expressions in myelopoiesis by analyzing public expression profiling data and primary samples from developing and mature myeloid cells. We thus uncovered differential activities of six NKL homeobox genes, namely DLX2, HHEX, HLX, HMX1, NKX3-1 and VENTX. We further examined public expression profiling data of 251 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 183 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, thereby identifying 24 deregulated genes. These results revealed frequent deregulation of NKL homeobox genes in myeloid malignancies. For detailed analysis we focused on NKL homeobox gene NANOG, which acts as a stem cell factor and is correspondingly expressed alone in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We detected aberrant expression of NANOG in a small subset of AML patients and in AML cell line NOMO-1, which served as a model. Karyotyping and genomic profiling discounted rearrangements of the NANOG locus at 12p13. But gene expression analyses of AML patients and AML cell lines after knockdown and overexpression of NANOG revealed regulators and target genes. Accordingly, NKL homeobox genes HHEX, DLX5 and DLX6, stem cell factors STAT3 and TET2, and the NOTCH-pathway were located upstream of NANOG while NKL homeobox genes HLX and VENTX, transcription factors KLF4 and MYB, and anti-apoptosis-factor MIR17HG represented target genes. In conclusion, we have extended the NKL-code to the myeloid lineage and thus identified several NKL homeobox genes deregulated in AML and MDS. These data indicate a common oncogenic role of NKL homeobox genes in both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. For misexpressed NANOG we identified an aberrant regulatory network, which contributes to the understanding of the oncogenic activity of NKL homeobox genes.",,"['Nagel, Stefan', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Koeppel, Max', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Dallmann, Iris', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Nagel S', 'Scherr M', 'MacLeod RAF', 'Pommerenke C', 'Koeppel M', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Dallmann I', 'Drexler HG']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4431-8988'],"['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191211,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (HLX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (NKX3-1 protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (VENTX protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6905564,,,,2019/12/12 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0226212 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-24651 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Dec 11;14(12):e0226212. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0226212. eCollection 2019.,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In disease gene identification and classification, the main aim is to identify disease genes while identifying non-disease genes are of less or no significant. Hence, this task can be defined as a one-class classification problem. Existing machine learning methods typically take into consideration known disease genes as positive training set and unknown genes as negative samples to build a binary-class classification model. Here we propose a new One-class Classification Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) method to precisely classify candidate disease genes. Our aim is to build a model that concentrate its focus on detecting known disease-causing gene to increase sensitivity and precision. We investigate the impact of our proposed model using a benchmark consisting of the gene expression dataset for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cancer. Compared with the traditional methods, our experimental result shows the superiority of our proposed method in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure to detect disease causing genes for AML.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that ponatinib dose reductions in definite settings can obtain optimal responses and lower ponatinib-related CV events. In this study, we describe the management of 5 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with ponatinib, from second to fourth line of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, carrying high pre-ponatinib CV risk, who obtained optimal molecular response and developed no CV adverse event during follow-up. Among these 5 patients, 2 had diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and underwent percutaneous angioplasty, 2 had type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension, and 1 had only arterial hypertension. Median follow-up for ponatinib therapy is 1,039 days (34.6 months). Median dosage administered is 30 mg a day. SCORE charts were used to estimate risk of CV death in 10 years and Charlson Comorbidity Index was applied to estimate age-adjusted risk of death related to comorbidities. Strict cardiologic follow-up (complete evaluation every 3 to 6 months) and maximum effort in the control of CV modifiable risk factors are strongly recommended in the management of ponatinib treatment in patients at high risk for CV events and may allow the use of ponatinib in patients belonging to CV risk category.","['(c) 2019 S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: AALL0331 enrolled 5,377 patients between 2005 and 2010. All patients received a 3-drug induction with dexamethasone, vincristine, and pegaspargase (PEG) and were then classified as SR low, SR average, or SR high. Patients with SR-average disease were randomly assigned to receive either standard 4-week consolidation (SC) or 8-week intensified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) consolidation (IC). Those with SR-high disease were nonrandomly assigned to the full COG-augmented BFM regimen, including 2 interim maintenance and delayed intensification phases. RESULTS: The 6-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for all patients enrolled in AALL0331 was 88.96% +/- 0.46%, and overall survival (OS) was 95.54% +/- 0.31%. For patients with SR-average disease, the 6-year continuous complete remission (CCR) and OS rates for SC versus IC were 87.8% +/- 1.3% versus 89.1% +/- 1.2% (P = .52) and 95.8% +/- 0.8% versus 95.2% +/- 0.8% (P = 1.0), respectively. Those with SR-average disease with end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) of 0.01% to < 0.1% had an inferior outcome compared with those with lower MRD and no improvement with IC (6-year CCR: SC, 77.5% +/- 4.8%; IC, 77.1% +/- 4.8%; P = .71). At 6 years, the CCR and OS rates among 635 nonrandomly treated patients with SR-high disease were 85.55% +/- 1.49% and 92.97% +/- 1.08%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 6-year OS rate for > 5,000 children with SR ALL enrolled in AALL0331 exceeded 95%. The addition of IC to treatment for patients with SR-average disease did not improve CCR or OS, even in patients with higher MRD, in whom it might have been predicted to provide more value.

NSCLP has a multifactorial etiology with more than 50 genes postulated to play an etiologic role. The genetic pathway comprised of Pbx-Wnt-p63-Irf6 genes was shown to control facial morphogenesis in mice and proposed as a regulatory pathway for NSCLP. Based on these findings, we investigated whether variation in PBX1, PBX2, and TP63, and their proposed interactions were associated with NSCLP. Fourteen single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in/nearby PBX1, PBX2, and TP63 were genotyped in 780 NSCLP families of nonHispanic white (NHW) and Hispanic ethnicities. Family-based association tests were performed for individual SNVs stratified by ethnicity and family history of NSCLP. Gene-gene interactions were also tested. A significant association was found for PBX2 rs3131300 and NSCLP in combined Hispanic families (p = .003) while nominal association was found for TP63 rs9332461 in multiplex Hispanic families (p = .005). Significant haplotype associations were observed for PBX2 in NHW (p = .0002) and Hispanic families (p = .003), and for TP63 in multiplex Hispanic families (.003).

The detection rAte of LZTR1 variants in our NS cohort was 4% similar to RAF1 and KRAS genes, indicating that variants in this gene might be frequent among our population. Three different variants were detected, c.742G>A (p.Gly248Arg), c.360C>A (p.His120Gln), and c.2245T>C (p.Tyr749His). The pathogenic variant c.742G>A (p.Gly248Arg) was found in five/seven patients. In our cohort 50% of patients presented heart defects and neurodevelopment delay or learning disabilities, short stature was present in 21% of them and one patient had acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Case presentation: A 37-year-old male patient experienced three distinct disease stages from myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) to a much more complexed phage of a mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). Both genetic and genomic alternations were detected including chromosomal abnormality and genic mutations. Result: Karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of either bone marrow or lymph node sample confirmed the presence of the FGFR1 rearrangement. Amplifications of RUNX1, ERG, and U2AF1 genes were identified by next generation sequencing. Furthermore, a frame-shift variant of F330fs(*)>149 in the RUNX1 gene and a missense mutation of R2263Q in NOTCH1 were also detected. Conclusion: The FGFR1 rearrangement functions as a trigging oncogenic event. Then other genetic events such as RUNX1 and/or NOTCH1 alternations further lead to progression of disease with trilineage blasts assignment.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Wang, Huang, Pang, Xiao, Gu, Zhang, Wang, Zhang and Yan.']","['Wang, Xiaoxue', 'Huang, Xinyue', 'Pang, Hui', 'Xiao, Sheng', 'Gu, Hongcang', 'Zhang, Heyang', 'Wang, Baixun', 'Zhang, Lijun', 'Yan, Xiaojing']","['Wang X', 'Huang X', 'Pang H', 'Xiao S', 'Gu H', 'Zhang H', 'Wang B', 'Zhang L', 'Yan X']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20191122,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6883488,,['NOTNLM'],"['FGFR1', 'MPAL', 'MPN', 'Notch', 'Runx1']",2019/12/12 06:00,2019/12/12 06:01,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01304 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Nov 22;9:1304. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01304. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of tumor entities depend on the uptake of the amino acid arginine since they have lost the ability to synthesize it endogenously, that is they do not express the rate limiting enzyme for arginine synthesis, argininosuccinate synthase (ASS). Arginine transport through the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is mediated by eight different transporters that belong to two solute carrier (SLC) families. In the present study we found that the proliferation of primary as well as immortalized chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells depends on the availability of extracellular arginine and that primary CLL cells do not express ASS and are therefore arginine-auxotrophic. The cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) was the only arginine importer expressed in CLL cells. Lentiviral-mediated downregulation of the CAT-1 transporter in HG3 CLL cells significantly reduced arginine uptake, abolished cell proliferation and impaired cell viability. In a murine CLL xenograft model, tumor growth was significantly suppressed upon induced downregulation of CAT-1 in the CLL cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of CAT-1 is a promising new therapeutic approach for CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Werner, Pieh, Echchannaoui, Rupp, Rajalingam, Theobald, Closs', 'and Munder.']","['Werner, Anke', 'Pieh, Daniel', 'Echchannaoui, Hakim', 'Rupp, Johanna', 'Rajalingam, Krishnaraj', 'Theobald, Matthias', 'Closs, Ellen I', 'Munder, Markus']","['Werner A', 'Pieh D', 'Echchannaoui H', 'Rupp J', 'Rajalingam K', 'Theobald M', 'Closs EI', 'Munder M']",,"['Third Department of Medicine (Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Third Department of Medicine (Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Cell Biology Unit, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Third Department of Medicine (Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Research Center for Immune Therapy, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Mainz, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Third Department of Medicine (Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Research Center for Immune Therapy, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191120,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6879669,,['NOTNLM'],"['amino acid transporter', 'arginine', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'nutrient restriction', 'tumor metabolism']",2019/12/12 06:00,2019/12/12 06:01,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01268 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Nov 20;9:1268. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01268. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting a desired antigen has shown extraordinary antitumor activity, especially in refractory and relapsed B-cell malignancies. The most representative in this respect, as well as the most successful example, is CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, with the widespread use of CAR T-cell therapy, problems of resistance and relapse are starting to be considered.

The botanical glycoside, oleandrin, derived from extracts of Nerium oleander, has previously been shown to reduce the levels of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) particles and inhibit HIV-1 infectivity in vitro. We therefore tested whether oleandrin or an extract from N. oleander could also inhibit the infectivity of the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1): A related enveloped retrovirus and emerging tropical infectious agent. The treatment of HTLV-1+ lymphoma T-cells with either oleandrin or a N. oleander extract did not significantly inhibit viral replication or the release of p19(Gag)-containing particles into the culture supernatants. However, the collected virus particles from treated cells exhibited reduced infectivity on primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMCs). Unlike HIV-1, extracellular HTLV-1 particles are poorly infectious and viral transmission typically occurs via direct intercellular interactions across a virological synapse. We therefore investigated whether oleandrin or a N. oleander extract could inhibit virus transmission from a GFP-expressing HTLV-1+ lymphoma T-cell-line to huPBMCs in co-culture assays. These results demonstrated that both oleandrin and the crude phytoextract inhibited the formation of virological synapses and the transmission of HTLV-1 in vitro. Importantly, these findings suggest oleandrin may have broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses by reducing the incorporation of the envelope glycoprotein into mature particles, a stage of the infection cycle not targeted by modern HAART.",,"['Hutchison, Tetiana', 'Yapindi, Lacin', 'Malu, Aditi', 'Newman, Robert A', 'Sastry, K Jagannadha', 'Harrod, Robert']","['Hutchison T', 'Yapindi L', 'Malu A', 'Newman RA', 'Sastry KJ', 'Harrod R']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, 75275-0376, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77054, USA.', 'Departments of Immunology and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77054, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, 75275-0376, USA.']",['eng'],['R15 CA202265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20190821,United States,J Antivir Antiretrovir,Journal of antivirals & antiretrovirals,101526954,,,,PMC6904119,['NIHMS1058777'],['NOTNLM'],"['Antiviral', 'Apoptosis', 'Envelope glycoprotein', 'HAART', 'HAM/TSP', 'HIV-1', 'HTLV-1', 'Nerium oleander', 'Oleandrin']",2019/12/12 06:00,2019/12/12 06:01,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.35248/1948-5964.19.11.184 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antivir Antiretrovir. 2019;11(3). doi: 10.35248/1948-5964.19.11.184.

In particular, dasatinib intake typically causes lymphocytosis, which has been linked to better clinical response. Since the underlying mechanisms are unknown and SRC family kinases are involved in many cell motility processes, we hypothesized that the movement and migration of lymphocytes is modulated by dasatinib. Patients, Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood samples from CML patients treated with second-line dasatinib were collected before and 2 h after the first dasatinib intake, and follow-up samples from the same patients 3 and 6 months after the start of therapy. The migratory capacity and phenotype of lymphocytes and differential blood counts before and after drug intake were compared for all study time-points. Results: We report here for the first time that dasatinib intake is associated with inhibition of peripheral blood T-cell migration toward the homeostatic chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, which control the trafficking toward secondary lymphoid organs, mainly the lymph nodes. Accordingly, the proportion of lymphocytes in blood expressing CCR7, the chemokine receptor for both CCL19 and CCL21, decreased after the intake including both naive CD45RA+ and central memory CD45RO+ T-cells. Similarly, naive B-cells diminished with dasatinib. Finally, such changes in the migratory patterns did not occur in those patients whose lymphocyte counts remained unchanged after taking the drug. Discussion: We, therefore, conclude that lymphocytosis induced by dasatinib reflects a pronounced redistribution of naive and memory populations of all lymphocyte subsets including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and B-cells.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Colom-Fernandez, Kreutzman, Marcos-Jimenez, Garcia-Gutierrez,', 'Cuesta-Mateos, Portero-Sainz, Perez-Garcia, Casado, Sanchez-Guijo,', 'Martinez-Lopez, Ayala, Boque, Xicoy, Montero, Soto, Paz, Silva, Vega-Piris,', 'Steegmann and Munoz-Calleja.']","['Colom-Fernandez, Beatriz', 'Kreutzman, Anna', 'Marcos-Jimenez, Ana', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Cuesta-Mateos, Carlos', 'Portero-Sainz, Itxaso', 'Perez-Garcia, Yaiza', 'Casado, Luis Felipe', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Ayala, Rosa M', 'Boque, Concha', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Montero, Isabel', 'Soto, Cesar', 'Paz, Raquel', 'Silva, Gabriela', 'Vega-Piris, Lorena', 'Steegmann, Juan Luis', 'Munoz-Calleja, Cecilia']","['Colom-Fernandez B', 'Kreutzman A', 'Marcos-Jimenez A', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Cuesta-Mateos C', 'Portero-Sainz I', 'Perez-Garcia Y', 'Casado LF', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Ayala RM', 'Boque C', 'Xicoy B', 'Montero I', 'Soto C', 'Paz R', 'Silva G', 'Vega-Piris L', 'Steegmann JL', 'Munoz-Calleja C']",,"['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio Hematologia y Hemoterapia, IRYCIS, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, IBSAL-Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', ""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Servicio de Hematologia, Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Barcelona, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Povisa, Vigo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de la Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Metodologia, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191125,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6886582,,['NOTNLM'],"['CCR7', 'Dasatinib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'lymphocytosis', 'migration']",2019/12/12 06:00,2019/12/12 06:01,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.01340 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Nov 25;10:1340. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.01340. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular state and molecular expression in spinal cord tissue after injury are extremely complex and closely related to functional recovery. However, the spatial and temporal changes of gene expression and regulation in various cell types after SCI are still unclear. Here, we collected the rostral and caudal regions to the lesion at 11 time points over a period of 28 days after rat hemisection SCI. Combining whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spinal cord tissue from injured and sham-operated animals. Significantly altered biological processes were enriched from DEGs in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, immune cells, and vascular systems after SCI. We then identified dynamic trends in these processes using the average expression profiles of DEGs. Gene expression and regulatory networks for selected biological processes were also constructed to illustrate the complicate difference between rostral and caudal tissues. Finally, we validated the expressions of some key genes from these networks, including alpha-synuclein, heme oxygenase 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, activating transcription factor 3, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Collectively, we provided a comprehensive network of gene expression and regulation to shed light on the molecular characteristics of critical biological processes that occur after SCI, which will broaden the understanding of SCI and facilitate clinical therapeutics for SCI.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Yu, Yao, Wang, Mao, Wang, Wu, Feng, Chen, Yang, Xue, Liu, Ding', 'and Gu.']","['Yu, Bin', 'Yao, Chun', 'Wang, Yongjun', 'Mao, Susu', 'Wang, Yaxian', 'Wu, Ronghua', 'Feng, Wei', 'Chen, Yanping', 'Yang, Jian', 'Xue, Chengbin', 'Liu, Dong', 'Ding, Fei', 'Gu, Xiaosong']","['Yu B', 'Yao C', 'Wang Y', 'Mao S', 'Wang Y', 'Wu R', 'Feng W', 'Chen Y', 'Yang J', 'Xue C', 'Liu D', 'Ding F', 'Gu X']",,"['Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Jiangsu Clinical Medicine Center of Tissue Engineering and Nerve Injury Repair, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Jiangsu Clinical Medicine Center of Tissue Engineering and Nerve Injury Repair, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong University, Nantong, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191122,Switzerland,Front Mol Neurosci,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914,,,,PMC6883948,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA-sequencing', 'astrocyte', 'microenvironment', 'microglia', 'oligodendrocyte', 'spinal cord injury', 'vasculation']",2019/12/12 06:00,2019/12/12 06:01,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnmol.2019.00287 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Neurosci. 2019 Nov 22;12:287. doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2019.00287. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis of data pertaining to 76 intermediate- and high-risk patients with MDS or AML who underwent allo-HSCT between December 2005 and June 2018 at the Peking University First Hospital. Forty patients received Decitabine-containing conditioning regimen before transplantation, while thirty-six patients received regimen without Decitabine. Results: Over a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 1 to 155), the cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft versus host disease was 12.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9-30.9%] in the Decitabine group and 41.5% (95% CI 28.1-61.2%) in the non-Decitabine group (P=0.005).

In the preclinical applications, nucleic acid aptamers have displayed the augmented specificity and selectivity via recognizing targets on leukemia cells based on unique three-dimensional conformations. As small molecules with nucleic acid characteristics, aptamers need to be chemically modified to resist nuclease degradation, renal clearance and improve binding affinities. Moreover, aptamers can be linked with neoteric detection techniques to enhance sensitivity and selectivity of diagnosis and therapy.

These results may in part be explained by data from preclinical models showing significant activity only at higher concentrations compared to those achieved with current dosing regimens. In the current pediatric trial, we applied an intra-patient dose escalation design. The purpose of this trial was to determine a safe dose recommendation (SDR) of single-agent vorinostat for intra-patient dose escalation, pharmacokinetic analyses (PK), and activity evaluation in children (3-18 years) with relapsed or therapy-refractory malignancies. RESULTS: A phase I intra-patient dose (de)escalation was performed until individual maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The starting dose was 180 mg/m(2)/day with weekly dose escalations of 50 mg/m(2) until DLT/maximum dose. After MTD determination, patients seamlessly continued in phase II with disease assessments every 3 months. PK and plasma cytokine profiles were determined. Fifty of 52 patients received treatment. n = 27/50 (54%) completed the intra-patient (de)escalation and entered phase II. An SDR of 130 mg/m(2)/day was determined (maximum, 580 mg/m(2)/day). n = 46/50 (92%) patients experienced treatment-related AEs which were mostly reversible and included thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, and vomiting. n = 6/50 (12%) had treatment-related SAEs. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Higher dose levels resulted in higher Cmax. Five patients achieved prolonged disease control (> 12 months) and showed a higher Cmax (> 270 ng/mL) and MTDs. Best overall response (combining PR and SD, no CR observed) rate in phase II was 6/27 (22%) with a median PFS and OS of 5.3 and 22.4 months. Low levels of baseline cytokine expression were significantly correlated with favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: An SDR of 130 mg/m(2)/day for individual dose escalation was determined. Higher drug exposure was associated with responses and long-term disease stabilization with manageable toxicity. Patients with low expression of plasma cytokine levels at baseline were able to tolerate higher doses of vorinostat and benefited from treatment.

METHODS: Following the general analytical strategy used in GBD 2016, the age-, sex-, and province-specific incidence and mortality in China were analyzed. Trends in the incidence and mortality from 2006 to 2016 were evaluated. RESULTS: It was estimated that there were 16,500 new cases and 10,300 deaths of multiple myeloma in China in 2016. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and mortality rates (ASMR) per 100,000 population were 1.03 (95% UI, 0.88-1.17) and 0.67 (95% UI, 0.59-0.77) in 2016. Males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females in all age groups. An upward trend with age in incidence and mortality was observed. Higher incidence and mortality rates clustered in the developed provinces. The incidence of MM in China increased significantly from 2006 to 2016, while the mortality increased from 2006 to 2014, and remained stable from 2014 to 2016.

Although virus eradication programs are applied in breeder flocks, ALVs are still widespread globally. Therefore, other valuable adjunct to reduce the negative effect of ALVs should be considered. Bursin-like peptide (BLP) showed remarkable immunomodulatory effects, whereas their influence on ALV-infected avian groups has not been reported. Here, a designed hybrid BLP was expressed in E. coli. The purified BLP was injected subcutaneously weekly in SPF chickens congenitally infected with a natural ALV strain. Then the influences of this BLP on the growth performance, immune response and virus titer of ALV-infected chickens were determined. RESULTS: This BLP injection significantly improved the body weights of ALV-infected birds (P < 0.05). BLP injection significantly enhanced organ index in the BF in ALV-infected birds (P < 0.05). The weekly injection of BLP significantly lengthened the maintenance time of antibodies against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) attenuated vaccine of ALV-infected birds (P < 0.05) and boosted the antibody titer against avian influenza virus (AIV) H5 inactive vaccine of mock chicken (P < 0.05). BLP injection in mock chickens enhanced the levels of serum cytokines (IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma) (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, the novel BLP significantly inhibited expression of the ALV gp85 gene in the thymus (P < 0.05), kidney (P < 0.05) and bursa of Fabricius (BF) (P < 0.01) of ALV-infected chickens. Both viral RNA copy number and protein level decreased significantly with BLP (50 mug/mL) inoculation before ALV infection in DF1 cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report investigating the influence of BLP on the growth and immunity performance of chickens infected by ALV. It also is the first report about the antiviral effect of BLP in vivo and in vitro. This BLP expressed in E. coli showed potential as a vaccine adjuvant, growth regulator and antiretroviral drug in chickens to decrease the negative effects of ALV infection.",,"['Zeng, Yukun', 'Gong, Zuxin', 'Wu, Binbin', 'Guan, Wenchao', 'Yu, Shenyi', 'An, Yajuan', 'Lu, Rongbin', 'Zhao, Jinrong', 'Wu, Yijian', 'Huang, Yifan', 'Wu, Xiaoping']","['Zeng Y', 'Gong Z', 'Wu B', 'Guan W', 'Yu S', 'An Y', 'Lu R', 'Zhao J', 'Wu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Wu X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2414-1081'],"[""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350004, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350004, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Animal Science, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China. wxp19781015@163.com."", ""Fujian Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China. wxp19781015@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['2018DK008/Discipline Development Grant from College of Animal Sciences FAFU', '31402227/Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20191210,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,['0 (Oligopeptides)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*drug effects', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens/growth & development', 'Escherichia coli', 'Newcastle disease virus/immunology', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'Poultry Diseases/*immunology/*virology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",PMC6902579,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALV', 'Bursin-like peptide', 'Growth', 'Immunity suppression', 'Virus inhibitor']",2019/12/12 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-019-2192-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-019-2192-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2019 Dec 10;15(1):447. doi: 10.1186/s12917-019-2192-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated that there is a positive correlation among GRP78, HIF-1alpha and BAG3. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of metabolic factors involved in invasive CLL on apoptotic factors. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on 77 patients diagnosed with CLL along with 100 healthy individuals. Cell blood count was performed for all participants. According to Binet's classification, CLL patients were divided into different groups. B cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of CLL patients by binding to anti-CD19 beads. The expression of BAG3, GRP78 and HIF-1alpha genes was analyzed using the RT-PCR method. To confirm the results of RT-PCR, western blot analysis was carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a strong association among the expression of BAG3, GRP78 and HIF-1alpha. The stage of CLL in patients was highly correlated with the expression rate of each gene (p<0.001). Accordingly, the western blot analysis indicated that the concentrations of GRP78 and HIF-1alpha were significantly higher than the expression of BAG3, considering the stage of CLL. CONCLUSION: It was shown that increased expression of GRP78 and HIF-1alpha could result in the elevation of BAG3, as well as the disease progression. Therefore, the role of these metabolic factors might be more pronounced compared with the anti-apoptotic agents to monitor disease progression in CLL patients.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Ijabi, Roghayeh', 'Roozehdar, Parisa', 'Afrisham, Reza', 'Moradi-Sardareh, Hemen', 'Kaviani, Saeed', 'Ijabi, Janat', 'Sahebkar, Amirhossein']","['Ijabi R', 'Roozehdar P', 'Afrisham R', 'Moradi-Sardareh H', 'Kaviani S', 'Ijabi J', 'Sahebkar A']",,"['Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Shast Kola Road, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Veterinary, Azad University, Garmsar Branch, Garmsar, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Hematology, School of Allied Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran.', 'Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAG3 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/analysis/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/analysis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BAG3', '*CLL', '*GRP78', '*HIF-1alpha', '*RT-PCR', '*western blot.']",2019/12/12 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-102906 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666191211101357 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(4):429-436. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666191211101357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, patients with ataxia-telangiectasia were followed to provide information regarding clinical and immunological features. METHODS: We report a case series of 18 patients diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia, who were referred to a tertiary center of clinical immunology from 2008-2018. Clinical presentations, medical records and lab data were observed during this period with a mean follow-up time of 4.57 +/- 2.66 years. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 10.92 +/- 3.24 years (11 females and 7 males). Thirteen patients (72.22%) were from families with consanguinity. Ataxia was the most common clinical feature, observed in 18 (100%) patients. The predominant clinical presentations were tremor and oculocutaneous telangiectasia, observed in 14 (77.8%) patients; dysarthria and oculomotor apraxia, observed in 13 (72.2%) patients. Infections were recorded in 12 (70.6%) patients. Decreased IgG level and IgA levels were observed in 5 (33.3%) and 6 (40.0%) patients, respectively. Decreased B-cell number and T-cell number were noted in 7 (46.67%) and 11 (73.33%) patients, respectively. Three (16.7%) patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and two of them expired subsequently. CONCLUSION: Ataxia-telangiectasia is a progressive disease with no established therapy; so, it necessitates early diagnosis and follow-up of the patients.

Although the survival rate has increased dramatically over the last decades, patients struggle with the adverse side effects of treatment. Treatment for ALL includes chemotherapy and irradiation - both of which are linked to cognitive impairments and alterations in central nervous system (CNS) structure and function detected by neuroimaging and in neurocognitive studies. The present article is a meta-analysis of the existing evidence for the mechanisms underlying changes in the CNS and neurocognitive function in ALL survivors after treatment. We found that compared with controls, ALL survivors develop: (i) cognitive sequelae in intelligence, academics, attention, memory, processing speed and executive function domains; (ii) decreased grey and white matter volume in cortical and several subcortical brain regions, with functional changes particularly in frontal regions and the hippocampus; (iii) neurocognitive impairments related to CNS changes; and (iv) reduction, but not resolution, of late neurocognitive sequelae in patients in whom prophylactic irradiation was replaced by systemic/intrathecal chemotherapy. Continued work with advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques will hopefully allow the detection of early CNS changes as biomarkers to help guide early diagnosis and intervention for neurocognitive defects in patients with childhood ALL.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Zhou, Chendan', 'Zhuang, Yong', 'Lin, Xingjie', 'Michelson, Alan D', 'Zhang, Aijun']","['Zhou C', 'Zhuang Y', 'Lin X', 'Michelson AD', 'Zhang A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6117-4560'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['81700144/Youth Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'ZR2014HM093/Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province/International', '2019GSF108060/Key Research and Development Program of Shandong', 'Province/International']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191210,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Central Nervous System/*anatomy & histology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*chemotherapy', '*children', '*cognitive dysfunction', '*radiotherapy']",2019/12/12 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2019/12/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16279 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Mar;188(6):945-961. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16279.

The accumulated experience of allografting in AML over the last four decades has provided critical insights into both the contribution of the conditioning regimen and the graft-versus-leukaemia effect to the curative potential of the most common form of immunotherapy utilised in standard clinical practice. Coupled with advances in donor availability and transplant technologies, this has resulted in allo-SCT becoming an important treatment modality for the majority of adults with high-risk AML. At the same time, advances in genomic classification, coupled with progress in the accurate quantification of measurable residual disease, have increased the precision with which allo-mandatory patients can be identified, whilst simultaneously permitting accurate identification of those patients who can be spared the toxicity of an allograft. Despite this progress, disease recurrence still remains a major cause of transplant failure and AML has served as a paradigm for the development of strategies to reduce the risk of relapse - notably the novel concept of post-transplant maintenance, utilising pharmacological or cellular therapies.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

However, its use in HLA-matched SCT has been less explored. Fifty-six consecutive patients who underwent allo-SCT for hematological malignancies have been included in this prospective single-center protocol. Donors have been HLA-identical siblings, fully-matched unrelated or 1-allele-mismatched unrelated donors in 30%, 32%, and 37% of cases, respectively. Nine patients have received a TBI-containing MAC regimen, while the remaining (84%) received RIC platforms based on Fludarabine plus Busulfan/Melphalan. Due to the high graft failure (GF) rate (21%) in a preliminary analysis in the allo-RIC cohort (n = 29), protocol amendments have been implemented, with no further cases of GF after the introduction of mini-thiotepa (0/18). The overall incidence of grade II-IV acute GvHD is 24% (95% CI: 17-31%) with four steroid-refractory cases. Severe chronic GvHD has occurred in only 1 of 43 evaluable cases. The 1-year NRM and relapse are 18% (95% CI: 12-26%) and 30% (18-42%) and the OS and DFS are 78% and 64%, respectively. These outcomes support the feasibility of using PTCy as a SOC outside the haplo-setting, albeit mini-thiotepa (3 mg/kg) was incorporated in the standard allo-RIC platforms to prevent GF.

Some patients do not respond to chemotherapy treatments and it is necessary to complement it with immunotherapy-based treatments such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, which is one of the newest and more effective treatments against these cancers and B-cell lymphoma. Although complete remission results are promising, CAR T cell therapy presents still some risks for the patients, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. We proposed a different immune cell source for CAR therapy that might prevent these side effects while efficiently targeting malignant cells. NK cells from different sources are a promising vehicle for CAR therapy, as they do not cause graft versus host disease (GvHD) in allogenic therapies and they are prompt to attack cancer cells without prior sensitization. We studied the efficacy of NK cells from adult peripheral blood (AB) and umbilical cord blood (CB) against different target cells in order to determine the best source for CAR therapy. AB CAR-NK cells are slightly better at killing CD19 presenting target cells and CB NK cells are easier to stimulate and they have more stable number from donor to donor.

However, the drivers of leukemia formation, therapy resistance, and relapse are leukemic stem cells (LSCs), whose properties were hardly reflected in these experimental setups. The present study was designed to address the effects of, and interactions between, EVI1 and retinoids in AML LSCs. We report that Evi1 reduced the maturation of leukemic cells and promoted the abundance, quiescence, and activity of LSCs in an MLL-AF9-driven mouse model of AML. atRA further augmented these effects in an Evi1 dependent manner. EVI1 also strongly enhanced atRA regulated gene transcription in LSC enriched cells. One of their jointly regulated targets, Notch4, was an important mediator of their effects on leukemic stemness. In vitro exposure of leukemic cells to a pan-RAR antagonist caused effects opposite to those of atRA. In vivo antagonist treatment delayed leukemogenesis and reduced LSC abundance, quiescence, and activity in Evi1(high) AML.

Although activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in most T-ALL cases, these mutations alone are not sufficient to drive the full development of T-ALL. beta-Arrestins (ARRB) are versatile and multifunctional adapter proteins that regulate diverse cellular functions, including promoting the development of cancer. However, the role of ARRBs in T-ALL has largely remained elusive. In this study, we showed that ARRB1 is expressed at low levels in assayed T-ALL clinical samples and cell lines. Exogenous ARRB1 expression inhibited T-ALL proliferation and improved the survival of T-ALL xenograft animals. ARRB1 facilitated NOTCH1 ubiquitination and degradation through interactions with NOTCH1 and DTX1. Mechanistically, the oncogenic miRNA (oncomiR) miR-223 targets the 3'-UTR of ARRB1 (BUTR) and inhibits its expression in T-ALL. Furthermore, overexpression of the ARRB1-derived miR-223 sponge suppressed T-ALL cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ARRB1 acts as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL by promoting NOTCH1 degradation, which is inhibited by elevated miR-223, suggesting that ARRB1 may serve as a valid drug target in the development of novel T-ALL therapeutics.Significance: These findings highlight a novel tumor suppressive function of the adaptor protein beta-arrestin1 in T-ALL.",['(c)2019

The aim of this study was to determine the current use of CAM methods by Turkish mothers for their children with cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample for this descriptive and cross-sectional study consisted of the mothers (n = 110) of children with cancer undergoing treatment in a hematology-oncology clinic and outpatient clinic. The data were collected using a questionnaire that included the CAM methods used by mothers for their children with cancer. RESULTS: Of 110 children, 65 (59.1%) were diagnosed with leukemia and 107 (97.3%) underwent chemotherapy. More than half of the mothers (53.6%) were using CAM methods. The most common CAM method was the use of natural products (93.2%), of which the most frequently used were carob, mulberry, and grape molasses. Mothers used CAM to support the treatment of their children with cancer and alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy and, in most cases, without previously consulting healthcare professionals about their use. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that most mothers used CAM methods for their children. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It is important that healthcare professionals are aware about the use of CAM methods in children with cancer to prevent any possible negative interaction between conventional (i.e., chemotherapy) and alternative treatments.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we aimed to determine the clonal involvement of the most frequent AML-associated mutations. Using a targeted sequencing panel for 18 genes, we traced changes and relative clonal contribution of mutations in 52 patients. We analysed 35 pairs of diagnosis and relapse samples, 27 pairs of primary samples and corresponding patient-derived xenografts, and 34 pairs of total leukocytes and corresponding isolated primitive cells or blast populations. In both relapse and xenografts, we observed conservation of main leukaemic clones and variability was limited to subclones with late-acquired mutations. AML evolution thus mainly involved modification of subclones while the clonal background remained unchanged.

Donor human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) 1 seropositivity is a critical concern when choosing relative donors, as they are not usually recommended due solely to the occurrence of donor-derived ATL. A previous report suggested that allo-HCT with an HTLV-1-seropositive donor increased ATL-related mortality. We updated the risk assessment for choosing an HTLV-1-seropositive allo-HCT donor for ATL. Our current registry data, which include larger numbers of HTLV-1-seropositive donors and longer observation periods, revealed no significant difference in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.24; P = .61) or cumulative incidence of either ATL-related (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.45; P = .80) or non-ATL-related mortality (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.37; P = .66). Similarly, when considering only patients with ATL in complete remission, there was no significant difference in overall survival (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.49; P = .91) or cumulative incidence of either ATL-related (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.66 to 2.20; P=0.54) or non-ATL-related mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.52-1.42; P = .66). These data indicate that selecting HTLV-1-seropositive donors might not be contraindicated for patients with ATL receiving allo-HCT if alternative donors are unavailable. Further risk assessment remains to be performed.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Chemical modification of l-asparaginase can decrease its side effects and improve its pharmacokinetic properties. The aim of this project was twofold: to chemically modify l-asparaginase with carboxymethyl dextran via carbodiimide cross linker, and to evaluate and compare the biochemical and structural properties of the native and modified enzymes. Chemical modification was done at 25 degrees C, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide and carbodiimide. Electrophoresis and free amino groups determination confirmed the chemical modification. Biochemical studies showed that the chemical modification could result in higher specific activity and stability of the modified enzyme. Structural studies further confirmed the chemical modification and revealed conformational changes in the modified enzyme. Taken together, the results showed that chemical modification with carboxymethyl dextran brings about improvement of biochemical properties through several changes in the structural attributes of l-asparaginase and might enhance its applicability in the treatment of childhood leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, drug resistance to these therapies has already been reported due to non-recurrent changes in oncogenic pathways and genes expression signatures. In this study, we investigated the cooperative role of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax and the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1. In particular, we found that JQ1 shows additional activity with venetoclax, in CLL cell lines and in ex vivo isolated primary CD19(+) lymphocytes, arguing in favour of combination strategies. Lastly, JQ1 is also effective in venetoclax-resistant CLL cell lines. Together, our findings indicated that the BET inhibitor JQ1 could be a promising therapy in CLL, both as first-line therapy in combination with venetoclax and as second-line therapy, after the emergence of venetoclax-resistant clones.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The most clinically important point is that mutation of the FLT3 gene is the most frequent genetic alteration and a poor prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. There are two major types of FLT3 mutations: internal tandem duplication mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations or deletion in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD). Both mutant FLT3 molecules are activated through ligand-independent dimerization and trans-phosphorylation. Mutant FLT3 induces the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, mainly STAT5, MAPK and AKT signals, leading to cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Because high-dose chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cannot sufficiently improve the prognosis, clinical development of FLT3 kinase inhibitors expected. Although several FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, it takes more than 20 years from the first identification of FLT3 mutations until FLT3 inhibitors become clinically available for AML patients with FLT3 mutations. To date, three FLT3 inhibitors have been clinically approved as monotherapy or combination therapy with conventional chemotherapeutic agents in Japan and/or Europe and United states. However, several mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors have already become apparent during their clinical trials. The resistance mechanisms are complex and emerging resistant clones are heterogenous. Further basic and clinical studies are required to establish the best therapeutic strategy for AML patients with FLT3 mutations.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Unfortunately, all patients eventually relapse and develop resistance to osimertinib. The current study addressed whether ERK inhibition exerts effects similar to those produced by MEK inhibition in overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib. METHODS: Drug effects on cell and tumor growth were assessed by measuring cell number alterations and colony formation in vitro and with xenografts in nude mice in vivo. Apoptosis was assessed with annexin V/flow cytometry and protein cleavage. Protein alterations in cells were detected with Western blot analysis. Gene overexpression and knockout were achieved with lentiviral infection and CRISPR/Cas9, respectively. RESULTS: The combination of osimertinib with an ERK inhibitor synergistically decreased the survival of osimertinib-resistant cell lines with enhanced induction of apoptosis and effectively inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant xenografts in nude mice. Moreover, the combination of an MEK or ERK inhibitor with a first-generation (eg, erlotinib) or second-generation (eg, afatinib) EGFR-TKI also very effectively inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant cells in vitro and of tumors in vivo, although these cell lines were cross-resistant to first-generation or second-generation EGFR-TKIs. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings emphasize the importance of targeting MEK/ERK signaling in maintaining the long-term benefit of osimertinib through overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib, warranting further investigation of this therapeutic strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib in the clinic.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Li, Yiting', 'Zang, Hongjing', 'Qian, Guoqing', 'Owonikoko, Taofeek K', 'Ramalingam, Suresh R', 'Sun, Shi-Yong']","['Li Y', 'Zang H', 'Qian G', 'Owonikoko TK', 'Ramalingam SR', 'Sun SY']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0757-3106', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0117-8826']","[""Department of Oncology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Department of Pathology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['UG1 CA233259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA223220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191210,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (osimertinib)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', '41UD74L59M (Afatinib)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*therapeutic use', 'Afatinib/therapeutic use', 'Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyridones/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7050394,['NIHMS1060301'],['NOTNLM'],"['*MEK/ERK', '*epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)', '*lung cancer', '*osimertinib', '*resistance']",2019/12/11 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32655 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Mar 15;126(6):1339-1350. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32655.

Objective: To examine the association between different types of fertility treatments and cancer risk in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study based on Danish population-based registry data and the Danish Infertility Cohort (individual record linkage) that included 1085172 children born in Denmark between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2012, linked with parental information. There were a total of 2217 children diagnosed with cancer (follow-up occurred during 1996-2015). Exposures: Maternal fertility treatment during the index pregnancy, including the use of fertility drugs (clomiphene [n = 33835], gonadotropins [n = 57136], gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs [n = 38653], human chorionic gonadotropin [n = 68181], progesterone [n = 41628], and estrogen [n = 16948]) and assisted reproductive technology (in vitro fertilization [n = 19448], intracytoplasmic sperm injection [n = 13417], and frozen embryo transfer [n = 3356]). Each exposure was examined separately and compared with children born to fertile women. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios and incidence rate differences for childhood cancer. Results: After 12.2 million person-years of follow-up (mean, 11.3 years), the incidence rate of childhood cancer was 17.5 per 100000 for children born to fertile women (n = 910291) and 44.4 per 100000 for children born after the use of frozen embryo transfer (n = 3356). Compared with children born to fertile women, the use of frozen embryo transfer was associated with an elevated risk of childhood cancer (14 cancer cases; hazard ratio, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.44 to 4.11]; incidence rate difference, 26.9 [95% CI, 2.8 to 51.0] per 100000), mainly due to an increased risk of leukemia (5 cancer cases; incidence rate, 14.4 per 100000; hazard ratio, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.19 to 6.93]; incidence rate difference, 10.1 [95% CI, -4.0 to 24.2] per 100000) and sympathetic nervous system tumors (<5 cancer cases; hazard ratio, 7.82 [95% CI, 2.47 to 24.70]). There were no statistically significant associations with the use of the other types of fertility treatment examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Among children born in Denmark, the use of frozen embryo transfer, compared with children born to fertile women, was associated with a small but statistically significant increased risk of childhood cancer; this association was not found for the use of other types of fertility treatment examined.",,"['Hargreave, Marie', 'Jensen, Allan', 'Hansen, Merete Kjaer', 'Dehlendorff, Christian', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Kjaer, Susanne K']","['Hargreave M', 'Jensen A', 'Hansen MK', 'Dehlendorff C', 'Winther JF', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Kjaer SK']",,"['Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Statistics and Pharmacoepidemiology, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Statistics and Pharmacoepidemiology, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University and University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Gynecology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,"['0 (Fertility Agents, Female)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Embryo Transfer/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/adverse effects', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic']",PMC7081748,,,,2019/12/11 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['2757228 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2019.18037 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2019 Dec 10;322(22):2203-2210. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.18037.,,,['JAMA. 2020 Apr 21;323(15):1505.

Previous gene expression studies in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells showed that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) altered the expression of many genes, including UBE2L6 (200-fold) and other members of the ISGylation pathway. Through gene expression analyses in a cohort of 98 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples and in primary neutrophils from healthy donors, we found that UBE2L6 gene expression is reduced in primary AML cells compared with normal mature granulocytes. To assess whether UBE2L6 expression is important for leukemic cell differentiation-two cell line models were employed: the human APL cell line NB4 and its ATRA-resistant NB4R counterpart, as well as the ATRA-sensitive human AML HL60 cells along with their ATRA-resistant subclone-HL60R. ATRA strongly induced UBE2L6 in NB4 APL cells and in ATRA-sensitive HL60 AML cells, but not in the ATRA-resistant NB4R and HL60R cells. Furthermore, short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated UBE2L6 depletion in NB4 cells impeded ATRA-mediated differentiation, suggesting a functional role for UBE2L6 in leukemic cell differentiation. In addition, ATRA induced ISG15 gene expression in NB4 APL cells, leading to increased levels of both free ISG15 protein and ISG15 conjugates. UBE2L6 depletion attenuated ATRA-induced ISG15 conjugation. Knockdown of ISG15 in NB4 APL cells inhibited ISGylation and also attenuated ATRA-induced differentiation. In summary, we demonstrate the functional importance of UBE2L6 in ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation of APL cells and propose that this may be mediated by its catalytic role in ISGylation.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The pathophysiology of AA in most cases is immune-mediated and is stimulated by type 1 cytotoxic T cells. Reliable early diagnostic tests of IAA are not yet available, therefore most of the cases are identified in advanced stages. Recently, abnormal immune response and hematopoietic cell deficiencies are defined genetically, such as in target cells of telomere repair gene mutations and by the dysregulation of T-cell activation pathways. Importantly, anti-thymocyte globulins and cyclosporine-associated immunosuppression are successful treatments for restoring blood cell production in most of the cases, however, clonal hematologic diseases remain challenging.

Recent advances in identification of cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations have provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of AML. Based on the above-mentioned parameters, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified AML into 25 subtypes, including 2 provisional entities, which differ in prognosis and treatment. In addition, certain mutations are associated with germline predisposition and increase the risk of inherited AML, which warrants family screening. Therefore, precise diagnosis and classification of AML are the most important steps in patient management. Both these steps require incorporation of history, clinical presentation, and laboratory results with studies performed by a pathologist. Pathologist-initiated studies include morphologic evaluation on the bone marrow aspirate and/or core biopsy, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic analysis by karyotyping and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular testing using gene panels and/or next-generation sequencing. A similar approach is employed during follow-up of patients after beginning treatment. Here, we describe in detail the various aspects of the workup, including purpose, limitations, and practice guidelines for the different studies. The process of choosing appropriate materials for the different studies is also addressed. We also provide an algorithm for the workup and risk stratification of AML based on guidelines recommended by the WHO, College of American Pathologists, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society of Medical Oncology, and the European LeukemiaNet.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Narayanan, Damodaran', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Narayanan D', 'Weinberg OK']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-5622', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4250-3891']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191210,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['genetic subtypes', 'mutational analysis', 'prognosis', 'work-up of AML']",2019/12/11 06:00,2020/10/03 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13135 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Feb;42(1):3-15. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13135.

The chromosomal rearrangements reposition a GATA2 distal hematopoietic enhancer from the original 3q21 locus to the EVI1 (also known as MECOM) locus on 3q26. Therefore, the GATA2 enhancer from one of two GATA2 alleles drives EVI1 gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which promotes the accumulation of abnormal progenitors and induces leukemogenesis. On the other hand, one allele of the GATA2 gene loses its enhancer, which results in reduced GATA2 expression. The GATA2 gene encodes a transcription factor critical for the generation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. GATA2 haploinsufficiency has been known to cause immunodeficiency and myeloid leukemia. Notably, reduced GATA2 expression suppresses the differentiation but promotes the proliferation of EVI1-expressing leukemic cells, which accelerates EVI1-driven leukemogenesis. A series of studies have shown that the GATA2 enhancer repositioning caused by the chromosomal rearrangements between 3q21 and 3q26 provokes misexpression of both the EVI1 and GATA2 genes and that these two effects coordinately elicit high-risk leukemia.",['(c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],"['Suzuki, Mikiko', 'Katayama, Saori', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki']","['Suzuki M', 'Katayama S', 'Yamamoto M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3237-9919'],"['Center for Radioisotope Sciences, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191209,England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*3q', '*EVI1', '*GATA2', '*chromosomal translocation', '*enhancer repositioning']",2019/12/11 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iub.2191 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2020 Jan;72(1):159-169. doi: 10.1002/iub.2191.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been associated with CV disease in diabetes mellitus and other clinical conditions. This study explores AGEs plasma levels, inflammatory status, and lipid profile in survivors of pediatric ALL who received HSCT conditioned with TBI. PROCEDURE: Inclusion criteria were (a) previous diagnosis of ALL at age < 18 years, treated with HSCT conditioned with TBI; (b) age > 18 at the time of the study enrollment; (c) off-therapy for at least five years. Radiotherapy other than TBI, preexisting heart disease, glucose metabolism impairment, body mass index > 25, active graft versus host disease (GvHD), smoking, or treatment with cholesterol lowering medications were exclusion criteria. Eighteen survivors and 30 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. RESULTS: AGEs plasma levels were markedly higher in ALL survivors than in healthy subjects (2.15 +/- 2.21 vs 0.29 +/- 0.15 pg/mL, P < 0.01). Survivors also showed higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (2.32 +/- 1.70 vs 0.88 +/- 1.09 mg/dL, P < 0.05), IL-1beta (7.04 +/- 1.52 vs 4.64 +/- 2.02 pg/mL, P < 0.001), IL17 (37.44 +/- 3.51 vs 25.19 +/- 6.34 pg/mL, P < 0.001), an increased glutathione/reduced glutathione ratio (0.085 +/- 0.07 vs 0.041 +/- 0.036, P < 0.05) and slight alterations in their lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show AGEs accumulation and chronic inflammation in ALL survivors who received HSCT conditioned with TBI.

However, relapse, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), is still a common cause of treatment failure. Up to now, the classic CNS-directed treatment for CNS leukemia (CNSL) has been aslant from cranial radiation to high-dose system chemotherapy plus intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy for the serious side effects of cranial radiation. The neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy and IT chemotherapy have been reported in recent years as well. For better prevention and treatment of CNSL, plenty of studies have tried to improve the detection sensitivity for CNSL and prevent CNSL from happening by targeting cytokines and chemokines which could be key factors for the traveling of ALL cells into the CNS. Other studies also have aimed to completely kill ALL cells (including dormant cells) in the CNS by promoting the entering of chemotherapy drugs into the CNS or targeting the components of the CNS niche which could be in favor of the survival of ALL cells in CNS. The aim of this review is to discuss the imperfection of current diagnostic methods and treatments for CNSL, as well as new attempts which could be significant for better elimination of CNSL.",,"['Zhou, Fen', 'Wen, Yuxi', 'Jin, Runming', 'Chen, Hongbo']","['Zhou F', 'Wen Y', 'Jin R', 'Chen H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9084-7277'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. jinrunm@qq.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. hbchen@hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System/*drug effects/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CNSL', '*Childhood ALL', '*Mechanisms', '*Targeted therapy', '*Treatments']",2019/12/11 06:00,2020/02/28 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10555-019-09827-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10555-019-09827-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2019 Dec;38(4):657-671. doi: 10.1007/s10555-019-09827-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests signaling of inactive BCR-ABL, which allows the survival of cancer cells, and relapse. We show that TKI treatment inhibits catalytic activity of BCR-ABL, but does not dissolve BCR-ABL core signaling complex, consisting of CRKL, SHC1, GRB2, SOS1, cCBL, p85a-PI3K, STS1 and SHIP2. Peptide microarray and co-immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that CRKL binds to proline-rich regions located in C-terminal, intrinsically disordered region of BCR-ABL, that SHC1 requires pleckstrin homology, src homology and tyrosine kinase domains of BCR-ABL for binding, and that BCR-ABL sequence motif located in disordered region around phosphorylated tyrosine 177 mediates binding of three core complex members, i.e., GRB2, SOS1, and cCBL. Further, SHIP2 binds to the src homology and tyrosine kinase domains of BCR-ABL and its inositol phosphatase activity contributes to BCR-ABL-mediated phosphorylation of SHC1. Together, this study characterizes protein-protein interactions within the BCR-ABL core complex and determines the contribution of particular BCR-ABL domains to downstream signaling.

However, the potential receptors of LPC in macrophages are poorly understood. Members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily, which is crucially involved in transducing environmental irritant stimuli into nociceptor activity, are potential receptors of LPC. In this study, we investigated whether LPC can induce the activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a member of the TRP superfamily. The functional expression of TRPA1 was first detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting and calcium imaging in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1)-derived macrophages. The mechanism by which LPC induces the activation of macrophages through TRPA1 was verified by cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium imaging, mtROS detection, a JC-1 assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the CCK-8 assay and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxic assay. LPC induced the activation of THP-1-derived macrophages via calcium influx, and this activation was suppressed by potent and selective inhibitors of TRPA1. These results indicated that TRPA1 can mediate mtROS generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, the secretion of IL-1beta and cytotoxicity through cellular and mitochondrial Ca(2+) influx in LPC-treated THP-1-derived macrophages. Therefore, the inhibition of TRPA1 may protect THP-1-derived macrophages against LPC-induced injury.",,"['Tian, Chao', 'Huang, Rongqi', 'Tang, Feng', 'Lin, Zuoxian', 'Cheng, Na', 'Han, Xiaobo', 'Li,

Survivin is overexpressed in numerous malignant diseases including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent studies have shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease-mediated gene-editing systems are suitable approach's for editing or knocking out various genes including oncogenes. Methods and materials: We used CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout the BIRC5 in the human leukemic cell line, HL60, and KG1, and these cell lines were transfected with either the Cas9- and three sgRNAs expressing plasmids or negative control (scramble) using Lipofectamine 3000. The efficacy of the transfection was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain (RT-qPCR) and surveyor mutation assays. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: We have successfully knocked out the BIRC5 gene in these leukemic cells and observed that the BIRC5-knocked out cells by CRISPR/Cas9 showed a significant decrease (30 folds) of survivin at mRNA levels. Moreover, cell death and apoptosis were significantly induced in BIRC5-CRISPR/Cas9-transfected cells compared to the scramble vector. Conclusion: We demonstrated for the first time that targeting BIRC5 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a suitable approach for the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells. However, further studies targeting this gene in primary leukemic cells are required.",['(c) 2019 Narimani et al.'],"['Narimani, Manizheh', 'Sharifi, Mohammadreza', 'Jalili, Ali']","['Narimani M', 'Sharifi M', 'Jalili A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1538-9034', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1833-4928']","['Cancer and Immunology Research Center, Institute of Research for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Cancer and Immunology Research Center, Institute of Research for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191127,New Zealand,Blood Lymphat Cancer,Blood and lymphatic cancer : targets and therapy,101596730,,,,PMC6885567,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BIRC5', 'CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease', 'HL60 cell', 'KG1 cells', 'survivin']",2019/12/11 06:00,2019/12/11 06:01,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/BLCTT.S230383 [doi]', '230383 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Lymphat Cancer. 2019 Nov 27;9:53-61. doi: 10.2147/BLCTT.S230383. eCollection 2019.,"['This work was supported by grants from Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences', 'to AJ to purchasing reagents for the thesis of MN as a PhD candidate in Molecular', 'Medicine.

Various clinical presentations have been attributed to the disease as a result of the different underlying genetic and epigenetic alterations. The current study has been initiated to study the role of an epigenetic alteration affecting the promoter of the TP53gene on CLL pathogenesis and progression. Methods: The current study involved 54 newly diagnosed patients presenting with CLL as well as 30 normal individuals as controls. After obtaining verbal consent, data collection was done and the blood collected from all enrolled individuals for hematological investigations as well as for molecular categorization of TP53 methylation status. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) technique was used to define the methylation status of the TP53 gene promoter that encompasses DNA extraction, bisulfite conversion, conventional PCR amplification, running on agarose gel and documentation. Finally, statistical analysis was done to assess any correlation of the TP53 epigenetic alteration to the disease etiology and the progression. Results: In the current study, all controls and 42 of 54 patients show unmethylated TP53 gene promoter; on the other hand, the methylated promoter was detected among 12 patients with a p-value of 0.001. TP53 gene promoter methylation significantly linked to reduced platelet count (p-value of 0.047) and advanced stage at presentation (p-value of 0.076). No significant differences were seen among both methylated and unmethylated TP53 promoters in relation to the age of the affected individuals, total white blood cell counts and hemoglobin level of the affected individuals. Conclusion: The current study revealed a significant correlation of TP53 gene promoter methylation to chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis and lower platelet counts.",['(c) 2019 Saeed et al.'],"['Saeed, Waleed Haji', 'Eissa, Adil Abozaid', 'Al-Doski, Adnan Anwar']","['Saeed WH', 'Eissa AA', 'Al-Doski AA']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5155-321X'],"['Department of Nursing, Akre Technical Institute, Duhok Polytechnic University, Duhok, Iraq.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of Duhok, Duhok, Iraq.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of Duhok, Duhok, Iraq.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191125,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,PMC6883927,,['NOTNLM'],"['TP53 gene promoter', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'epigenetic alteration']",2019/12/11 06:00,2019/12/11 06:01,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S221707 [doi]', '221707 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2019 Nov 25;10:399-404. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S221707. eCollection 2019.,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high level of KPNB1 has been reported in various cancers which promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. However, the role of KPNB1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains uncertain. Methods: Expression level of KPNB1 in CML patient samples and cell lines was analyzed by Western blotting. The proliferation assays and colony formation assay were used to study the CML cell proliferation when KPNB1 knockdown in vitro. Next, Western blotting was used to evaluate the effects of KPNB1 on E2F1 and other cell cycle regulators. Then, the location of E2F1 was detected by immunofluorescence. Finally, flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of KPNB1 inhibitor importazole (IPZ) on CML cells. Results: In this study, we firstly showed that KPNB1 is over-expressed in CML cells. Targeting KPNB1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and IPZ reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis of CML cells. The underlying mechanisms were also investigated that E2F1 nuclear transport was blocked after inhibiting KPNB1 with siRNA, suggesting KPNB1 over-expression mediates the excessive nuclear transport of E2F1 in CML cells. Moreover, the expression of the E2F1 targeted molecule such as c-Myc and KPNA2 was markedly reduced. The IPZ arrested CML cells at G2/M phase and induced cell apoptosis. Conclusion: In summary, our results clearly showed that KPNB1 is over-expressed in CML cells and mediates the translocation of E2F1 into the nucleus of CML cells, thereby inhibition of KPNB1 reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis of CML cells which provides new insights for targeted CML therapies.",['(c) 2019 Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Teng', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Huang, Ningshu', 'Peng, Yuhang', 'Gao, Miao', 'Wang, Xin', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Wang T', 'Huang Z', 'Huang N', 'Peng Y', 'Gao M', 'Wang X', 'Feng W']",,"[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191202,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6896920,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'E2F1', 'IPZ', 'KPNB1', 'c-Myc', 'subcellular location']",2019/12/11 06:00,2019/12/11 06:01,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S210048 [doi]', '210048 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Dec 2;12:10455-10467. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S210048. eCollection 2019.,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long non-coding RNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (lncRNA TUG1) has been discovered to participate in multiple cancers including AML. However, the detailed mechanism of TUG1 in AML remains obscure. Materials and methods: AML cell lines HL-60 and Kasumi-1 were taken as cell models. TUG1 knockdown or overexpression cell lines were generated. Then, the biological influence of TUG1 on cancer cells was studied using CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and Western blot in vitro. Interaction between TUG1 and miR-370-3p was determined by bioinformatics analysis, RT-PCR, and luciferase assay. Western blot, RT-PCR, and luciferase assay were carried out to validate the interaction between miR-370-3p and its target gene Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1). Results: Knockdown of TUG1 markedly reduced viability and metastasis of AML cells, while its overexpression had the opposite effect. MAPK1 was verified as a target gene of miR-370-3p. TUG1 could reduce the level of functional miR-370-3p, facilitate MAPK1 expression, and in turn activate ERK1/2 signaling. Conclusion: TUG1 could modulate malignant phenotypes of AML cells via miR-370-3p/MAPK1/ERK signaling.

The annual incidence of ALL is 4 patients per 100,000 children. Their peak age is between 2-5 Year. One of the most important prognostic factors is cytogenetic abnormalities which are very effective in determining treatment policy. Aim: To determine the frequency of cytogenetic findings and its effect on the outcome of children with ALL. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on children with ALL who their disease was diagnosed between 2001and 2009. Furthermore, 206 patients with ALL were examined by referring to Clinic of Ali Asghar Hospital in Tehran. Data was collected from medical records and analyzed by SPSS16 software. Results: 206 children with ALL were enrolled in the study. The estimated event-free survival rate of all enrolled patients was more than 70%. There was a significant relationship between type of cytogenetic disorder and clinical outcome of patients (P<0.0001), where the highest mortality was observed in patients with t (9;22) and t (4;11). There was no significant correlation between the sex and age with the clinical outcome of the patient (P = 0.064; p=0.322). There was a statistically significant relationship between mediastinal mass and clinical outcome (P = 0.002), indicating that the presence of cells growth in an involuntary way can be cause of the cancer. A significant association was found between the clinical outcome of patients and radiotherapy (P = 0.043), indicating that radiotherapy is effective in improving cancer. Conclusion: The findings demonstrated that the average survival rate without recurrence in children was at level of the European countries. However, the strong chemotherapy weakened the role of many prognostic factors in ALL patients, but some translocations are prognostic factors in predicting death in patients with ALL. Therefore, patients with this factor need to receive more confident treatment policy. Comprehensive studies are required by focusing on more samples because of low number of relapses and deaths in the present study.","['(c) 2019 Gholamreza Bahoush1, Marzieh Nojoomi.']","['Bahoush, Gholamreza', 'Nojoomi, Marzieh']","['Bahoush G', 'Nojoomi M']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Ali-Asghar Children Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, I.R.

Here, we combine phenotypic screening with chemical genetics to identify pre-messenger RNA endonuclease cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3 (CPSF3) as the target of JTE-607, a small molecule with previously unknown target. We show that CPSF3 represents a synthetic lethal node in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Ewing's sarcoma cancer cell lines. Inhibition of CPSF3 by JTE-607 alters expression of known downstream effectors in AML and Ewing's sarcoma lines, upregulates apoptosis and causes tumor-selective stasis in mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, it prevents the release of newly synthesized pre-mRNAs, resulting in read-through transcription and the formation of DNA-RNA hybrid R-loop structures.

Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting FLT3 have been evaluated clinically, but their effects are limited when used in monotherapy due to the emergence of drug-resistance. Thus, a better understanding of drug-resistance pathways could be a good strategy to explore and evaluate new combinational therapies for AML. Here, we used phosphoproteomics to identify differentially-phosphorylated proteins in patients with AML and TKI resistance. We then studied resistance mechanisms in vitro and evaluated the efficacy and safety of rational combinational therapy in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in mice. Proteomic and immunohistochemical studies showed the sustained activation of ERK1/2 in bone marrow samples of patients with AML after developing resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, which was identified as a common resistance pathway. We examined the concomitant inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 and FLT3 as a strategy to overcome drug-resistance, finding that the MEK inhibitor trametinib remained potent in TKI-resistant cells and exerted strong synergy when combined with the TKI midostaurin in cells with mutated and wild-type FLT3. Importantly, this combination was not toxic to CD34+ cells from healthy donors, but produced survival improvements in vivo when compared with single therapy groups. Thus, our data point to trametinib plus midostaurin as a potentially beneficial therapy in patients with AML.",,"['Morales, Maria Luz', 'Arenas, Alicia', 'Ortiz-Ruiz, Alejandra', 'Leivas, Alejandra', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Rodriguez-Garcia, Alba', 'Castro, Nerea', 'Zagorac, Ivana', 'Quintela-Fandino, Miguel', 'Gomez-Lopez, Gonzalo', 'Gallardo, Miguel', 'Ayala, Rosa', 'Linares, Maria', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin']","['Morales ML', 'Arenas A', 'Ortiz-Ruiz A', 'Leivas A', 'Rapado I', 'Rodriguez-Garcia A', 'Castro N', 'Zagorac I', 'Quintela-Fandino M', 'Gomez-Lopez G', 'Gallardo M', 'Ayala R', 'Linares M', 'Martinez-Lopez J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0685-8441', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3950-9002', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3699-9130', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3180-6560']","['H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Breast Cancer Clinical Research Unit, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Breast Cancer Clinical Research Unit, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.', 'Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain. mlinares@ucm.es.', 'Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. mlinares@ucm.es.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre - Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.', 'Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191209,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyridones/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidinones/*administration & dosage', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC6901485,,,,2019/12/11 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-54901-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-54901-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Dec 9;9(1):18630. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-54901-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have increasingly shown that circRNA and LncRNA play important roles in the development of tumors, but their roles remain unclear in the mechanism of AML resistance. Materials and Methods: Resistant AML cell line HL-60/ADM (adriamycin, ADM) was constructed and circRNA, LncRNA, and mRNA expression profiles were screened followed by high-throughput sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis was then carried out, and the circRNA-miRNA ceRNA network was constructed and confirmed using qRT-PCR analysis. Results: A total of 1824 circRNAs, 2414 LncRNAs, and 5346 mRNAs were screened for differentially expressed genes. Enrichment analysis was performed utilizing Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, which mainly involved protein domain specific binding, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor, and cellular metabolism. The mTOR signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, RAP1 signaling pathway, and Akt signaling pathway were closely related to drug resistance. Conclusion: Our study provides a systematic outlook on the potential function of ncRNA in the molecular mechanisms of resistant AML cells.

In this study, combining surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and principal component analysis (PCA), we achieve the biochemical changes of MTX-induced Jurkat cell apoptosis and the location information of MTX embedded in DNA. In contrast, we also present the corresponding result of Daunorubicin (DNR)-induced Jurkat cell apoptosis. It is found that the location of MTX embedded in DNA of Jurkat cell is different from DNR, in which the action site of MTX is mainly implemented by blocking and destroying AT base pairs while DNR is performed by embedding and destroying GC base pairs and then the base A.

Core binding factor-Leukemia (CBFL) is characterized by the recurrent reciprocal translocations t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13;q22) that, expressing the distinctive RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (also known as Acute myeloid leukemia1-eight twenty-one, AML1-ETO or RUNX1/ETO) or CBFB-MYH11 (also known as CBFbeta-SigmaMMHX) translocation product respectively, disrupt the essential hematopoietic function of the CBF. In the past decade, remarkable progress has been achieved in understanding the structure, three-dimensional (3D) chromosomal topology, and disease-inducing genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of the fusion proteins that arise from disruption of the CBF subunit alpha and beta genes. Although CBFLs have a relatively good prognosis compared to other leukemia subtypes, 40-50% of patients still relapse, requiring intensive chemotherapy and allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). To provide a rationale for the CBFL-associated altered hematopoietic development, in this review, we summarize the current understanding on the various molecular mechanisms, including dysregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling as an early event that triggers the translocations, playing a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of CBFL. Translation of these findings into the clinical setting is just beginning by improvement in risk stratification, MRD assessment, and development of targeted therapies.",,"['Beghini, Alessandro']",['Beghini A'],,"['Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, 20142 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['FRRB2015/Fondazione Regionale per la Ricerca Biomedica (Regional Foundation for', 'Medical Research), Regione Lombardia, Italy']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191207,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6966602,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CBFB', 'MYH11', 'RUNX1', 'RUNX1T1', 'chromatin remodeling', 'core binding factor leukemia', 'miRNA']",2019/12/11 06:00,2019/12/11 06:01,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11121973 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11121973 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Dec 7;11(12). pii: cancers11121973. doi: 10.3390/cancers11121973.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a cytosolic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase interacting with immune receptors, has been previously associated with malignant transformation and cancer cell proliferation, we aimed to assess its role in ETV6-RUNX1 cell survival and prognosis. We evaluated the effects on cell survival of three SYK inhibitors and showed that all of them, in particular entospletinib, are able to induce cell death and enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics. By using reverse phase protein arrays we next revealed that activated SYK is upregulated at diagnosis in pediatric ETV6-RUNX1 patients who will experience relapse, and, importantly, hyperactivation is maintained at a high level also at relapse occurrence. We thus treated primary cells from patients both at diagnosis and relapse with the combination entospletinib + chemotherapeutics and observed that SYK inhibition is able to sensitize resistant primary cells to conventional drugs. Entospletinib could thus represent a new therapeutic option supporting conventional chemotherapy for relapsed ETV6-RUNX1 patients, and these evidences encourage further studies on SYK for treatment of other relapsed resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subgroups.",,"['Serafin, Valentina', 'Porcu, Elena', 'Cortese, Giuliana', 'Mariotto, Elena', 'Veltri, Giulia', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Accordi, Benedetta']","['Serafin V', 'Porcu E', 'Cortese G', 'Mariotto E', 'Veltri G', 'Bresolin S', 'Basso G', 'Accordi B']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3960-8561', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2359-1056']","['Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Citta della Speranza, 35127 Padova, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Pediatric Oncohematology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Pediatric Oncohematology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Pediatric Oncohematology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Pediatric Oncohematology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", 'Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Citta della Speranza, 35127 Padova, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Pediatric Oncohematology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", 'Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Citta della Speranza, 35127 Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Citta della Speranza, 35127 Padova, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Pediatric Oncohematology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191207,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (2-(2-aminocyclohexylamino)-4-(m-tolylamino)pyrimidine-5-carboxamide)', '0 (6-(1H-indazol-6-yl)-N-(4-morpholinophenyl)imidazo(1,2-a)pyrazin-8-amine)', '0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'SQ8A3S5101 (fostamatinib)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclohexylamines/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Morpholines', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6940898,,['NOTNLM'],"['SYK', 'entospletinib', 'leukemia', 'relapse']",2019/12/11 06:00,2020/05/02 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20246175 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20246175 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 7;20(24). pii: ijms20246175. doi: 10.3390/ijms20246175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, we evaluate an Fc-optimized (amino acid substitutions S239D/I332E) FLT3 antibody termed 4G8-SDIEM (FLYSYN) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (NCT02789254). Here we studied the possibility to induce NK cell ADCC against B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) by Fc-optimized FLT3 antibody treatment. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that FLT3 is widely expressed on B-ALL cell lines and leukemic cells of B-ALL patients. FLT3 expression did not correlate with that of CD20, which is targeted by Rituximab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) employed in B-ALL treatment regimens. Our FLT3 mAb with enhanced affinity to the Fc receptor CD16a termed 4G8-SDIE potently induced NK cell reactivity against FLT3-transfectants, the B-ALL cell line SEM and primary leukemic cells of adult B-ALL patients in a target-antigen dependent manner as revealed by analyses of NK cell activation and degranulation. This was mirrored by potent 4G8-SDIE mediated NK cell ADCC in experiments with FLT3-transfectants, the cell line SEM and primary cells as target cells.

We have previously shown that high levels of Notch receptors and ligands could interfere with drug response. In this study, the protein expression of 79 AML blast samples collected from newly diagnosed patients was examined through flow cytometry. Gamma-secretase inhibitors were used in AML mouse xenograft models to evaluate the contribution of Notch pharmacological inhibition to mouse survival. We used univariate analysis for testing the correlation and/or association between protein expression and well-known prognostics markers. All the four receptors (Notch1-4) and some ligands (Jagged2, DLL-3) were highly expressed in less mature subtypes (M0-M1). Notch3, Notch4, and Jagged2 were overexpressed in an adverse cytogenetic risk group compared to good cytogenetic risk patients. Chi-square analysis revealed a positive association between the complete remission rate after induction therapy and weak expression of Notch2 and Notch3. We also found an association between low levels of Notch4 and Jagged2 and three-year remission following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Accordingly, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed improved OS for patients lacking significant expression of Notch4, Jagged2, and DLL3. In vivo experiments in an AML mouse model highlighted both improved survival and a significant reduction of leukemia cell burden in the bone marrow of mice treated with the combination of Notch pan-inhibitors (GSIs) plus chemotherapy (Ara-C).

Despite the remarkable efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1, some patients may not respond (primary resistance) or may relapse after an initial response (secondary resistance). In a small proportion of cases, development of resistance is accompanied or shortly followed by progression from chronic to blastic phase (BP), characterized by a dismal prognosis. Evolution from CP into BP is a multifactorial and probably multistep phenomenon. Increase in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels is thought to promote the onset of secondary chromosomal or genetic defects, induce differentiation arrest, perturb RNA transcription, editing and translation that together with epigenetic and metabolic changes may ultimately lead to the expansion of highly proliferating, differentiation-arrested malignant cells. A multitude of studies over the past two decades have investigated the mechanisms underlying the closely intertwined phenomena of drug resistance and disease progression. Here, we provide an update on what is currently known on the mechanisms underlying progression and present the latest acquisitions on BCR-ABL1-independent resistance and leukemia stem cell persistence.",,"['Bavaro, Luana', 'Martelli, Margherita', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Soverini, Simona']","['Bavaro L', 'Martelli M', 'Cavo M', 'Soverini S']",,"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Hematology/Oncology ""L. e A.

Its receptor (IL7R) is a transmembrane heterodimer formed by the IL7Ralpha and the IL2Rgamma chain (gammac). The IL7R signals through the JAK/STAT pathway. Loss-of-function mutations and some polymorphisms of the IL7Ralpha were associated to immunodeficiency and inflammatory diseases, respectively. Gain-of-function mutations were described in T-cell ALL and in high risk precursor B-cell ALL. Most confirmed loss-of-function mutations occur in the extracellular part of the IL7Ralpha while oncogenic mutations are exclusively found in the extracellular juxtamembrane (EJM) or transmembrane regions. Oncogenic mutations promote either IL7Ralpha/IL7Ralpha homodimerization and constitutive signaling, or increased affinity to gammac or IL-7.

However, few fusions are recurrent across AML and the identification of these rare chimeras is of interest to characterize AML patients. Here, we studied the transcriptome of 8 adult AML patients with poorly described chromosomal translocation(s), with the aim of identifying novel and rare fusion transcripts. We integrated RNA-sequencing data with multiple approaches including computational analysis, Sanger sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and in vitro studies to assess the oncogenic potential of the ZEB2-BCL11B chimera. We detected 7 different fusions with partner genes involving transcription factors (OAZ-MAFK, ZEB2-BCL11B), tumor suppressors (SAV1-GYPB, PUF60-TYW1, CNOT2-WT1) and rearrangements associated with the loss of NF1 (CPD-PXT1, UTP6-CRLF3). Notably, ZEB2-BCL11B rearrangements co-occurred with FLT3 mutations and were associated with a poorly differentiated or mixed phenotype leukemia. Although the fusion alone did not transform murine c-Kit+ bone marrow cells, 45.4% of 14q32 non-rearranged AML cases were also BCL11B-positive, suggesting a more general and complex mechanism of leukemogenesis associated with BCL11B expression. Overall, by combining different approaches, we described rare fusion events contributing to the complexity of AML and we linked the expression of some chimeras to genomic alterations hitting known genes in AML.",,"['Padella, Antonella', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Paciello, Giulia', 'Giotopoulos, George', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Righi, Simona', 'Ghetti, Martina', 'Stengel, Anna', 'Guadagnuolo, Viviana', 'De Tommaso, Rossella', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Robustelli, Valentina', 'Franchini, Eugenia', 'Rora, Andrea Ghelli Luserna di', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Fontana, Maria Chiara', 'Bruno, Samantha', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Sabattini, Elena', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Ficarra, Elisa', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Padella A', 'Simonetti G', 'Paciello G', 'Giotopoulos G', 'Baldazzi C', 'Righi S', 'Ghetti M', 'Stengel A', 'Guadagnuolo V', 'De Tommaso R', 'Papayannidis C', 'Robustelli V', 'Franchini E', 'Rora AGLD', 'Ferrari A', 'Fontana MC', 'Bruno S', 'Ottaviani E', 'Soverini S', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Haferlach C', 'Sabattini E', 'Testoni N', 'Iacobucci I', 'Huntly BJP', 'Ficarra E', 'Martinelli G']",,"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Speciality Medicine, University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, 47014 Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Department of Control and Computer Engineering DAUIN, Politecnico di Torino, 10129 Turin, Italy.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."", 'Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

This study aimed to examine the associations between food/nutrient intake and the levels of HDL-C in a cohort of children and young adult survivors of cALL. Eligible participants (n = 241) were survivors of cALL (49.4% boys; median age: 21.7 years old) recruited as part of the PETALE study. Nutritional data were collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Fasting blood was used to determine participants' lipid profile. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the associations between intakes of macro- and micronutrients and food groups and plasma lipids. We found that 41.3% of cALL survivors had at least one abnormal lipid value. Specifically, 12.2% had high triglycerides, 17.4% high LDL-cholesterol, and 23.1% low HDL-C. Low HDL-C was inversely associated with high intake (third vs. first tertile) of several nutrients: proteins (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08-0.92), zinc (OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.84), copper (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12-0.99), selenium (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.05-0.59), niacin (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08-0.84), riboflavin (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.76) and vitamin B12 (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13-0.90). High meat consumption was also inversely associated (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.09-0.83) with low HDL-C while fast food was positively associated (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.03-5.63) with low HDL-C.

Survival rates of 15% after four years are currently achieved; deaths are only in part due to aGvHD itself, but mostly due to adverse effects of R-aGvHD treatment with immunosuppressive agents as these predispose patients to opportunistic infections and loss of graft-versus-leukemia surveillance resulting in relapse. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from different tissues and those generated by various protocols have been proposed as a remedy for R-aGvHD but the enthusiasm raised by initial reports has not been ubiquitously reproduced. (2) Methods: We previously reported on a unique MSC product, which was generated from pooled bone marrow mononuclear cells of multiple third-party donors. The products showed dose-to-dose equipotency and greater immunosuppressive capacity than individually expanded MSCs from the same donors. This product, MSC-FFM, has entered clinical routine in Germany where it is licensed with a national hospital exemption authorization. We previously reported satisfying initial clinical outcomes, which we are now updating. The data were collected in our post-approval pharmacovigilance program, i.e., this is not a clinical study and the data is high-level and non-monitored. (3) Results: Follow-up for 92 recipients of MSC-FFM was reported, 88 with GvHD >/= degrees III, one-third only steroid-refractory and two-thirds therapy resistant (refractory to steroids plus >/=2 additional lines of treatment). A median of three doses of MSC-FFM was administered without apparent toxicity. Overall response rates were 82% and 81% at the first and last evaluation, respectively. At six months, the estimated overall survival was 64%, while the cumulative incidence of death from underlying disease was 3%. (4) Conclusions: MSC-FFM promises to be a safe and efficient treatment for severe R-aGvHD.",,"['Bonig, Halvard', 'Kuci, Zyrafete', 'Kuci, Selim', 'Bakhtiar, Shahrzad', 'Basu, Oliver', 'Bug, Gesine',

Although ibrutinib is active in CLL, it is rarely able to clear leukemic cells protected by bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) within the marrow niche. We investigated the modulation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway in CLL by BMSCs and its targeting with AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor) or Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor). B cells collected from controls and CLL patients, were treated with medium alone, ibrutinib, JAK/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) inhibitors, or both drugs, in the presence of absence of BMSCs. JAK2/STAT3 axis was evaluated by western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that STAT3 was phosphorylated in Tyr705 in the majority of CLL patients at basal condition, and increased following co-cultures with BMSCs or IL-6. Treatment with AG490, but not Stattic, caused STAT3 and Lyn dephosphorylation, through re-activation of SHP-1, and triggered CLL apoptosis even when leukemic cells were cultured on BMSC layers. Moreover, while BMSCs hamper ibrutinib activity, the combination of ibrutinib+JAK/STAT inhibitors increase ibrutinib-mediated leukemic cell death, bypassing the pro-survival stimuli derived from BMSCs. We herein provide evidence that JAK2/STAT3 signaling might play a key role in the regulation of CLL-BMSC interactions and its inhibition enhances ibrutinib, counteracting the bone marrow niche.",,"['Severin, Filippo', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Carraro, Samuela', 'Tibaldi, Elena', 'Brunati, Anna Maria', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Facco, Monica', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Severin F', 'Frezzato F', 'Visentin A', 'Martini V', 'Trimarco V', 'Carraro S', 'Tibaldi E', 'Brunati AM', 'Piazza F', 'Semenzato G', 'Facco M', 'Trentin L']",,"['Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine-DMM, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine-DMM, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, University of Padua, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['#15397/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', '#20836/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro']",['Journal Article'],20191204,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6966457,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ibrutinib', 'JAK2 inhibitor', 'STAT3 inhibitor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'microenvironment']",2019/12/11 06:00,2019/12/11 06:01,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11121939 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11121939 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Dec 4;11(12). pii: cancers11121939. doi: 10.3390/cancers11121939.,"['L.T. received research founding by Gilead and Janssen.

BCR-ABL1 mRNAs are usually identified using a conventional RT-PCR technique according to the BIOMED-1 method. In this study, we evaluated 122 BCR-ABL1-positive samples with the Q-LAMP assay to establish if this technology may represent a valid alternative to the qualitative BIOMED-1 PCR technique usually employed for the detection and the discrimination of the common BCR-ABL1 transcripts (p190 and p210 isoforms). We found a 100% concordance rate between the two methods. Specifically, the p190- and p210-positive samples were amplified by Q-LAMP with a median threshold time (Tt) of 26.70 min (range: 24.45-31.80 min) and 20.26 min (range: 15.25-34.57 min), respectively. A median time of 19.63 was observed in samples displaying both (e13a2/e14a2) p210 isoforms. Moreover, the Q-LAMP assay allowed recognition of the BCR-ABL1 e13a2 and e14a2 isoforms (median Tts 18.48 for e13a2 vs. 26.08 min for e14a2; p < 0.001). Finally, 20 samples harboring rare BCR-ABL1 isoforms (e1a3, e13a3, e14a3, and e19a2) were correctly identified by the Q-LAMP assay. We conclude that the Q-LAMP assay may represent a faster and valid alternative to the qualitative BIOMED-1 RT-PCR for the diagnosis at BCR-ABL1-positive leukemias, especially when samples are analyzed in centers with restricted resources and/or limited technical expertise.",,"['Stella, Stefania', 'Gottardi, Enrico Marco', 'Favout, Valeria', 'Barragan Gonzalez, Eva', 'Errichiello, Santa', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Luciano, Luigia', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Grimaldi, Francesco', 'Pironi, Lucrezia', 'Sargas Simarro, Claudia', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Izzo, Barbara']","['Stella S', 'Gottardi EM', 'Favout V', 'Barragan Gonzalez E', 'Errichiello S', 'Vitale SR', 'Fava C', 'Luciano L', 'Stagno F', 'Grimaldi F', 'Pironi L', 'Sargas Simarro C', 'Vigneri P', 'Izzo B']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7947-158X'],"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

Mutated STAT3 is mainly associated with large granular lymphocytic T-cell leukemia, whereas mutated STAT5B is associated with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and gammadelta T-cell-derived lymphomas. Hyperactive STAT3 and STAT5 are also implicated in various hematopoietic and solid malignancies, such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma or prostate cancer. Classical understanding of STAT functions is linked to their phosphorylated parallel dimer conformation, in which they induce gene transcription. However, the functions of STAT proteins are not limited to their phosphorylated dimerization form. In this review, we discuss the functions and the roles of unphosphorylated STAT3/5 in the context of chromatin remodeling, as well as the impact of STAT5 oligomerization on differential gene expression in hematopoietic neoplasms. The central involvement of STAT3/5 in cancer has made these molecules attractive targets for small-molecule drug development, but currently there are no direct STAT3/5 inhibitors of clinical grade available.

Therefore, a simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous monitoring of 11 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in human plasma. TKIs included in the assay are used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML: imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib), polycythemia vera (ruxolitinib), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ibrutinib) and rheumatoid arthritis (filgotinib, tofacitinib, baricitinib, peficitinib). Caffeine was also included in the method. Caffeine increases the acidity of the stomach and decreases its pH as well as is a competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Thus, it may influence absorption and metabolism of some TKIs, by modifying their plasma levels. The analytes of interest and their stable isotope-labeled internal standards were extracted from 200muL of human plasma. Microelution-solid phase extraction (mu-SPE) was optimized for method validation and compared to simple protein precipitation (PPT). A gradient elution on a Poroshell 120EC-C18 column at 60 degrees C and a flow rate of 0.5mL/min was applied for analyte separation. The analytical run lasted 8min and it was followed by a re-equilibration time of 4min. Dynamic multiple reaction monitoring scan in the positive ionization mode was applied to improve method sensitivity. Endogenous plasma phospholipids can strongly affect MS analysis. Hence, the monitoring of endogenous phospholipids was included in the assay. Full validation of the method was achieved, including tests of precision, accuracy, trueness, linearity, extraction recovery, matrix effect, process efficiency, stability, sensitivity (with excellent LLOQs), selectivity, identity confirmation and carry-over effect. Regarding sample cleanup, more than 91% of early eluting and more than 96% of late eluting endogenous phospholipids were eliminated by mu-SPE when compared to PPT. This method enables the simultaneous plasma monitoring of 11 TKIs and caffeine and ensures high effectiveness in phospholipids elimination. The present approach is currently used in our clinical practice, being applied to TDM of dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib. TKIs plasma monitoring helps to individualize dose adjustment and manage adverse effects in CML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors differentiate into the myeloid or lymphoid lineage in response to specific cytokines. Cell-type specific receptors are expressed on committed progenitors that bind to other late-acting cytokines that are involved in terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In normal hematopoiesis, these receptors undergo alternative splicing and are developmentally regulated. Splicing changes can significantly affect the structure and function of the receptors resulting in alterations of either the extracellular ligand binding domain or the cytoplasmic signaling domain responsible for cellular growth and differentiation. Most alternatively spliced isoforms generally lose the ability to promote differentiation. Evidently, overexpression of naturally occurring cytokine receptor alternate isoforms are observed in multiple myeloid diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and polycythemia vera (PV). The purpose of this review is to introduce the various isoforms of key cytokine receptors that play a crucial role in myeloid development and their potential role in myeloid diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Immune dysfunction is frequently observed in individuals with KS, but the role of KMT2D in immune system function has not been identified. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand the mechanisms driving KS-associated immune deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia [low IgA], splenomegaly, and diminished immunization responses). METHODS: We performed a comprehensive evaluation of humoral immunity and secondary lymphoid tissues in an established KS (Kmt2d(+/betaGeo)) mouse model and validated select findings in a patient with KS. RESULTS: Compared with wild-type littermates, Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice demonstrated deficiencies in multiple B-cell lineages and reduced serum IgA and elevated IgM levels across multiple ages. The bone marrow, spleen, and intestine of Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice contained diminished numbers of IgA-secreting cells, while elevated germinal center B cells were found in the mesenteric lymph node and Peyer patches. Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice have decreased size and numbers of Peyer patches, a finding confirmed in human samples. We identified deficiency of Itgb7 RNA and protein expression, a gene encoding an adhesion protein that mediates intestinal homing, and we demonstrated KMT2D-dependent control of ITGB7 expression in a human cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Kmt2d haploinsufficiency has broad deleterious effects on B-cell differentiation, specifically hampering gut lymphocyte homing and IgA(+) plasma cell differentiation. Intestinal lymphoid defects caused by ITGB7 deficiency have not previously been recognized in KS, and these results provide new mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of KS-associated immune deficiency.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The finding that most somatic cells can be directly converted into cells of another lineage by the expression of specific transcription factors has paved the way to novel applications. Induced neurons (iNs) represent an alternative source of neurons for disease modeling, drug screening, and potentially, for cell replacement therapy. This unit describes methods for the efficient conversion of blood cells into iNs, including protocols to isolate cord blood CD133+ cells, infect them with Sendai virus vectors that express SOX2 and c-MYC, and differentiate the infected cells (PB-MNCs) into mature neurons. A method to reprogram peripheral blood mononuclear cells into iNs is also described. Support protocols describe how to culture rat astrocytes and characterize the electrophysiology of iNs.

Data were therefore extracted from an international nested case-control study, recruiting 798 patients with SC diagnosed concurrently or after the MPN. Overall, 2995 person-years (PYs) were accumulated and mortality rate (MR) since SC diagnosis was 5.9 (5.1-6.9) deaths for every 100 PYs. A ""poor prognosis"" SC (stomach, esophagus, liver, pancreas, lung, ovary, head-and-neck or nervous system, osteosarcomas, multiple myeloma, aggressive lymphoma, acute leukemia) was reported in 26.3% of the patients and was the cause of death in 65% of them (MR 11.0/100 PYs). In contrast, patients with a ""non-poor prognosis"" SC (NPPSC) incurred a MR of 4.6/100 PYs: 31% of the deaths were attributed to SC and 15% to MPN evolution. At multivariable analysis, death after SC diagnosis was independently predicted (HR and 95% CI) by patient age greater than 70 years (2.68; 1.88-3.81), the SC prognostic group (2.57; 1.86-3.55), SC relapse (1.53; 10.6-2.21), MPN evolution (2.72; 1.84-4.02), anemia at SC diagnosis (2.32; 1.49-3.59), exposure to hydroxyurea (1.89; 1.26-2.85) and to ruxolitinib (3.63; 1.97-6.71). Aspirin was protective for patients with a NPPSC (0.60; 0.38-0.95). In conclusion, SC is a relevant cause of death competing with MPN evolution. Prospective data are awaited to confirm the role of cytoreductive and anti-platelet drugs in modulating patient survival after the occurrence of a SC.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Marchetti, Monia', 'Ghirardi, Arianna', 'Masciulli, Arianna', 'Carobbio, Alessandra', 'Palandri, Francesca', 'Vianelli, Nicola', 'Rossi, Elena', 'Betti, Silvia', 'Di Veroli, Ambra', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Finazzi, Guido', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Patriarca, Andrea', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Casetti, Ilaria Carola', 'Stephenson, Clemency', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Elli, Elena Maria', 'Palova, Miroslava', 'Rapezzi, Davide', 'Erez, Daniel', 'Gomez, Montse', 'Wille, Kai', 'Perez-Encinas, Manuel', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Angona, Anna', 'Fox, Maria Laura', 'Beggiato, Eloise', 'Benevolo, Giulia', 'Carli, Giuseppe', 'Cacciola, Rossella', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'Tieghi, Alessia', 'Recasens, Valle', 'Isfort, Susanne', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'De Stefano, Valerio', 'Griesshammer, Martin', 'Alvarez-Larran, Alberto', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Marchetti M', 'Ghirardi A', 'Masciulli A', 'Carobbio A', 'Palandri F', 'Vianelli N', 'Rossi E', 'Betti S', 'Di Veroli A', 'Iurlo A', 'Cattaneo D', 'Finazzi G', 'Bonifacio M', 'Scaffidi L', 'Patriarca A', 'Rumi E', 'Casetti IC', 'Stephenson C', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Elli EM', 'Palova M', 'Rapezzi D', 'Erez D', 'Gomez M', 'Wille K', 'Perez-Encinas M', 'Lunghi F', 'Angona A', 'Fox ML', 'Beggiato E', 'Benevolo G', 'Carli G', 'Cacciola R', 'McMullin MF', 'Tieghi A', 'Recasens V', 'Isfort S', 'Pane F', 'De Stefano V', 'Griesshammer M', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Rambaldi A', 'Barbui T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7615-0572', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5576-5412', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2876-4833', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4401-0812', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0716-1686', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7572-9504', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1809-284X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3200-9654', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5129-8597', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5178-5827', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2747-6327']","['Oncology Unit, Cardinal Massaia Hospital, Asti, Italy.', 'FROM Research Foundation, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.', 'FROM Research Foundation, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.', 'FROM Research Foundation, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

A systematic review of all therapeutic clinical trials focusing on adult FLT3-mutated AML was conducted from 2000 to 2017. An updated search was performed using ClinicalTrials.gov for trials added between October 2017 and December 2018. Analysis was performed for ClinicalTrials.gov search results from 2000 to 2017 to provide descriptive estimates of discrepancies between anticipated clinical trial enrollment using consistently cited rates of adult participation of 1%, 3%, and 5%, as well as 10% participation identified by the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2008. Twenty-five pharmaceutical or biological agents aimed at treating FLT3-mutant AML were identified. Pharmaceutical vs cooperative group/nonprofit support was 2.3:1, with 30 different pharmaceutical collaborators and 13 cooperative group/nonprofit collaborators. The number of patients needed to satisfy study enrollment begins to surpass the upper bound of estimated participation in 2010, noticeably surpassing projected participation rates between 2015 and 2016.

Treatment with VEN-HMAs results in prolonged cytopenia, thereby exposing patients to invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Here, we retrospectively studied a cohort of 119 AML patients treated with VEN-HMAs and analyzed the occurrence of IFIs, as well as our practice of antifungal prophylaxis, with the aim to identify the nature and risk factors for IFIs and their association with the type of antifungal prophylaxis used. The intended antifungal prophylaxis was micafungin in 38% of patients, azoles in 41% of patients, and none in 21% of patients. Older age was associated with no antifungal prophylaxis or micafungin use and lesser use of azoles (P = .043). We recorded 15 (12.6%) patients who developed probable or proven IFIs, with a median onset of 72 days (range, 35-281) after starting therapy. IFIs were more common among nonresponders compared with responders to VEN-HMA therapy (22% vs 6%, P = .0132) and in r/r compared with newly diagnosed AML (19% vs 5%, P = .0498); however, the antifungal prophylaxis used, patient age, hypomethylating agent schedule, history of prior allogeneic transplant, and initial neutropenia duration did not influence the development of IFIs during therapy. We conclude that the overall risk of IFIs during VEN-HMA therapy is low. The risk of IFIs is higher in nonresponders and in those who were treated in the r/r setting; these patients need reevaluation of their antifungal prophylaxis to minimize the risk of IFIs during therapy.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Dadwal, Sanjeet', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Tegtmeier, Bernard', 'Mei, Matthew', 'Arslan, Shukaib', 'Al Malki, Monzr M', 'Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Ali, Haris', 'Aribi, Ahmed', 'Sandhu, Karamjeet', 'Khaled, Samer', 'Snyder, David', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Dadwal S', 'Zhang J', 'Tegtmeier B', 'Mei M', 'Arslan S', 'Al Malki MM', 'Salhotra A', 'Ali H', 'Aribi A', 'Sandhu K', 'Khaled S', 'Snyder D', 'Nakamura R', 'Stein AS', 'Forman SJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Pullarkat V']",,"['Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, and.', 'Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, and.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.']",['eng'],['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC6963254,,,,2019/12/10 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['429582 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000930 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Dec 10;3(23):4043-4049. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000930.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLV lacking the IN TP via an altered open reading frame was used to infect tumorigenesis mouse model (MYC/Runx2) animals to observe integration patterns and phenotypic effects, but viral passage resulted in the restoration of the IN TP through small deletions. Mice subsequently infected with an MLV IN lacking the TP coding sequence (TP-) showed an improved median survival by 15 days compared to wild type (WT) MLV infection. Recombination with polytropic endogenous retrovirus (ERV), Pmv20, was identified in seven mice displaying both fast and slow tumorigenesis, highlighting the strong selection within the mouse to maintain the full-length IN protein. Mapping the genomic locations of MLV in tumors from an infected mouse with no observed recombination with ERVs, TP-16, showed fewer integrations at TSS and CpG islands, compared to integrations observed in WT tumors. However, this mouse succumbed to the tumor in relatively rapid fashion (34 days). Analysis of the top copy number integrants in the TP-16 tumor revealed their proximity to known MLV common insertion site genes while maintaining the MLV IN TP- genotype. Furthermore, integration mapping in K562 cells revealed an insertion preference of MLV IN TP- within chromatin profile states associated with weakly transcribed heterochromatin with fewer integrations at histone marks associated with BET proteins (H3K4me1/2/3, and H3K27Ac). While MLV IN TP- showed a decreased overall rate of tumorigenesis compared to WT virus in the MYC/Runx2 model, MLV integration still occurred at regions associated with oncogenic driver genes independently from the influence of BET proteins, either stochastically or through trans-complementation by functional endogenous Gag-Pol protein.",,"['Loyola, Lorenz', 'Achuthan, Vasudevan', 'Gilroy, Kathryn', 'Borland, Gillian', 'Kilbey, Anna', 'Mackay, Nancy', 'Bell, Margaret', 'Hay, Jodie', 'Aiyer, Sriram', 'Fingerman, Dylan', 'Villanueva, Rodrigo A', 'Cameron, Ewan', 'Kozak, Christine A', 'Engelman, Alan N', 'Neil, James', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Loyola L', 'Achuthan V', 'Gilroy K', 'Borland G', 'Kilbey A', 'Mackay N', 'Bell M', 'Hay J', 'Aiyer S', 'Fingerman D', 'Villanueva RA', 'Cameron E', 'Kozak CA', 'Engelman AN', 'Neil J', 'Roth MJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7972-5159', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4607-194X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2000-2578', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6436-0521', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7343-8482', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5611-0354', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9709-2591', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2219-0402']","['Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Dept of Pharmacology, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Harvard Medical School, Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Univ. of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, College of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Univ. of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, College of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Univ. of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, College of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Univ. of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pathology Bearsden, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Univ. of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, College of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Dept of Pharmacology, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Dept of Pharmacology, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Dept of Pharmacology, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'Univ. of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pathology Bearsden, United Kingdom.', 'NIH, NIAID, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Harvard Medical School, Department of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'MRC Univ. of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, College of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Dept of Pharmacology, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P50 GM082251/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI039394/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM122518/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'A11951/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'P50 AI150481/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM110639/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 AI000300/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191209,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Runx2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Chromatin', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Vectors/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', '*Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Retroviridae Infections', '*Tumor Virus Infections', 'Virus Integration']",PMC6974304,,,,2019/12/10 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008154 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-19-01159 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2019 Dec 9;15(12):e1008154. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008154. eCollection 2019 Dec.,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors led a single-center retrospective analysis of 118 cases of tumors diagnosed in the first year of life and compared tumors' types incidence, presentation, location, and outcome according to age group at diagnosis (below or over 28 d of life). RESULTS: The most frequent neonatal tumor types in our series were germ cell tumors, mainly teratoma, followed by neuroblastoma and renal tumors, whereas in children below 1 year of age, brain tumors, neuroblastoma, and leukemia were the most common types. Genetic predisposition syndromes were present in 14% of these infants and antenatal sonography enabled 68% of diagnosis for tumors presenting at birth. Other patients presented with mass syndrome, hydrops, or skin lesions. Six percent of neonates with cancer died from their malignancies, and up to 18% experienced a chronic health condition as a consequence of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor pattern differs in neonates and infants, with a higher percentage of benign tumors in children below 28 days of life.

An apparent trade-off has been an increase in invasive fungal disease (IFD), affecting multiple organs. We report the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in 8 children with lymphoid cancers who developed intracranial (IC) fungal abscesses between 2010 and 2017. METHODS: Children below 15 years of age undergoing treatment for leukemia/lymphoma with clinicoradiologic and microbiologic evidence of IC fungal abscess were included. Demographic details, clinical profile, and management were retrospectively audited. Treatment was guided by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions for IFD with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-directed azole dosing, and surgical intervention. RESULTS: Eight patients (4 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 2 non-Hodgkin lymphoma) were eligible for analysis. Proven, probable, and possible IFDs were seen in 2 (25%), 4 (50%), and 2 (25%) patients, respectively. Proven IFDs were invasive mucormycosis with remaining having mold infections. Cerebrospinal fluid galactomannan was positive in all 4 patients in whom it was tested. TDM was possible in 5/8 (63%) patients. Antifungal therapy was given for a median period of 4.2 months with 5 (63%) patients having complete resolution. Three (37%) patients expired, of which 2 were attributable to IFDs. CONCLUSIONS: IC fungal abscesses in children can cause significant morbidity and mortality in children with hematolymphoid cancers.

In this review, we highlight recent insights into risk stratification for patients with pediatric AML and discuss data driving current and developing therapeutic approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in cytogenetics and molecular profiling, as well as improvements in detection of minimal residual disease after induction therapy, have informed risk stratification, which now relies heavily on these elements. The treatment of childhood AML continues to be based primarily on intensive, conventional chemotherapy. However, recent trials focus on limiting treatment-related toxicity through the identification of low-risk subsets who can safely receive fewer cycles of chemotherapy, allocation of hematopoietic stem-cell transplant to only high-risk patients and optimization of infectious and cardioprotective supportive care. SUMMARY: Further incorporation of genomic and molecular data in pediatric AML will allow for additional refinements in risk stratification to enable the tailoring of treatment intensity. These data will also dictate the incorporation of molecularly targeted therapeutics into frontline treatment in the hope of improving survival while decreasing treatment-related toxicity.",,"['Elgarten, Caitlin W', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Elgarten CW', 'Aplenc R']",,"['Division of Oncology.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Oncology.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Patient Care', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,2019/12/10 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000855 [doi]', '00008480-202002000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2020 Feb;32(1):57-66. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000855.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a life-threatening treatment-related toxicity that limits the full therapeutic potential in adults. We report outcomes for adults with r/r ALL treated with an optimized CTL019 dosing and CRS management strategy. METHODS: Adults with r/r B-cell ALL received CTL019 in 1 of 2 trials. Patients received lymphodepletion followed by CTL019 as either a one-time infusion or fractionated infusions split over 3 days (day 1, 10%; day 2, 30%; day 3, 60%), which allowed for day 2 and day 3 doses to be held for early CRS. Total planned CTL019 dose varied with adaptive protocol modifications in response to efficacy and CRS toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-five adults with r/r ALL received CTL019 in 1 of 3 dosing cohorts. The low-dose cohort (n = 9) received single or fractionated dosing and had manageable toxicity with a 33% complete remission (CR) rate. In the high-dose single infusion cohort, 3 of 6 patients with refractory CRS concurrent with culture-positive sepsis died, and 3 achieved CR. The 20 patients in the high-dose fractionated (HDF) cohort had a 90% CR rate and manageable CRS. The HDF cohort had the highest survival, with a 2-year overall survival of 73% (95% CI, 46% to 88%) and event-free survival of 49.5% (95% CI, 21% to 73%).

At present, non-invasive liquid (blood) biopsy is not utilized for leukemia, due to lower counts of leukemia blast cells in the blood. Here, we described a robust system for the simultaneous detection and enrichment of rare blast cells. Enrichment of blast cells was achieved from blood with a one-step microfluidic blast cell biochip (BCB) sorting system, without specific targeting of proteins by antibodies. Non-target cells encountered a differential net force as compared to stiffer blast cells and were removed. The efficiency of the BCB promotes high detection sensitivity (1 in 10(6) cells) even from patients with minimal residual disease. The procedure was validated using actual blast cells from patients with various types of leukemia. Outcomes were compared to current evaluation standards, such as flow cytometry, using BM aspirates. Blast cell detection efficiency was higher in 55.6% of the patients using the BCB as compared to flow cytometry, despite the lower concentrations of blast cells in liquid biopsy.

To the best of our knowledge, only 87 cases of malignant rhabdoid tumour have been reported to date, inclusive of 4 cases with presumed radiation-induced aetiology. We report a case of malignant rhabdoid tumour in an adult with presumed radiation-induced aetiology to enrich the armamentarium of this disease entity, which may have some implications for early diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease in the future. CASE SUMMARY: A 27-year-old male, who was exposed to cranial irradiation at the age of 4 years as part of the treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, presented with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure for one week. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion at the hypothalamus. Stereotactic biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination of the lesion showed malignant rhabdoid tumour. The disease progressed rapidly, with manifestation of leptomeningeal spread. He was started on craniospinal irradiation but treatment was suspended after 5.4 Gy, as he developed myelosuppression. His clinical condition deteriorated rapidly, and he succumbed to his illness within 2 mo. CONCLUSION: This fifth case of radiation-induced central nervous system rhabdoid tumour re-enforces the aggressive nature of this disease with poor prognosis.","['(c)The Author(s) 2019.

Extramedullary relapse of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) within the breast is exceedingly rare and there is paucity of data in the literature regarding this entity. No consensus exists on management of isolated extramedullary breast relapses of T-ALL. Herein, we report a case of isolated extramedullary breast relapse of T-ALL treated with breathing adapted radiation therapy (BART) using the active breathing control (ABC) system. CASE SUMMARY: The patient was a 33-year-old female with diagnosis of T-ALL. She received intensive systemic chemotherapy that resulted in complete remission of her disease, and then underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After a 15 mo period without symptoms and signs of progression, the patient presented with palpable masses in both breasts. She complained from severe pain and swelling of the breasts. Imaging workup showed bilateral breast lesions, and diagnosis of breast infiltration by leukemic cells was confirmed after immunohistopathological evaluation. The patient suffering from severe pain, discomfort, and swelling of both breasts due to leukemic infiltration was referred to the Radiation Oncology Department for symptomatic palliation. Whole breast irradiation was delivered to both breasts of the patient with BART using the ABC system. The patient had complete resolution of her symptoms after treatment with BART. CONCLUSION: BART with the ABC system resulted in complete resolution of the patient's symptoms due to leukemic infiltration of both breasts with T-ALL. This contemporary treatment technique should be preferred for radiotherapeutic management of patients with leukemic infiltration of the breasts to achieve effective symptomatic palliation.","['(c)The Author(s) 2019.

Pulmonary mucormycosis often leads to systemic dissemination and eventual death. It is imperative for transplant providers to have a high level of suspicion for mucormycosis and initiate early treatment. Here, we present a 64-year-old woman who died of disseminated mucormycosis 13 days following her allogeneic HSCT. Case Presentation: A 64-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presented for allogeneic HSCT and passed away from intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to mucormycosis infection 13 days following her transplant. On autopsy, it was found she had angioinvasive mucormycosis in her frontal lobe leading to cerebral edema which eventually led to tonsillar herniation and brainstem infarction. Her lungs were the likely source of infectious dissemination. Discussion: This case represents an unusual course of events following HSCT in that no other published case shows tonsillar herniation resulting from mucormycosis-related intracerebral swelling. We also report this case because it is believed mucormycosis in HSCT patients is underreported. Additionally, our case highlights the importance of increased vigilance for mucormycosis in patients with prolonged neutropenia prior to HSCT and the potential link of voriconazole prophylaxis and increased risk for mucormycosis.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Chetan Jeurkar et al.'],"['Jeurkar, Chetan', 'Margetich, Lauren', 'Sahin, Ziver']","['Jeurkar C', 'Margetich L', 'Sahin Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6127-2251'],"['Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Department of Medical Oncology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Department of Pathology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20191111,Egypt,Case Rep Infect Dis,Case reports in infectious diseases,101573243,,,,PMC6878774,,,,2019/12/10 06:00,2019/12/10 06:01,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/5138198 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Infect Dis. 2019 Nov 11;2019:5138198. doi: 10.1155/2019/5138198. eCollection 2019.,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional experiments demonstrated that knockdown of PCAT-1 remarkably inhibited proliferation, arrested cell cycle progression and triggered apoptosis of AML cells. Mechanistically, we revealed that PCAT-1 could directly interact with FZD6 protein to regulate its stability. Overexpression of FZD6 partly abolished the effects of PCAT-1 silencing on AML cells. Our integrated experiments then suggested that PCAT-1 could activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in an FZD6-dependent manner.

The intensity of chemotherapy and further therapeutic decisions depend on several prognostic factors, including response to initial treatment by examining peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples at certain time points. (e.g. day 15 BM). Sample quality is crucial for the correct risk assessment. Patients and methods: We aimed to explore the rate of inadequate samples as a source of preanalytical error. We retrospectively analyzed flow cytometry results of BM (day 15 and day 33) and CSF samples from children with ALL in different cohorts focusing on PB contamination and viable cell ratio among nucleated cells. We also compared viable cell percentages in native and stabilized CSF samples. Results: Due to PB contamination (erythroid precursors < 2%) 12.5% of day 15 and 14% of day 33 BM samples were inadequate for flow cytometry risk stratification. Significantly fewer CSF samples had to be considered inadequate for analysis (defined as viable cells < 30%) in the subgroup of stabilized samples compared to native samples. Four of the CSF samples from children with ALL had identifiable malignant cell population despite the low viable cell percentage. Discussion: Poor sample quality can hamper risk stratification and further therapeutic decision in childhood ALL. Despite low viable cell count malignant cell populations may still be identified in a CSF sample, therefore establishing a certain cutoff point for viable cells is difficult.","['Copyright (c) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory', 'Medicine (IFCC).

These unique properties constitute a strong therapeutic potential that place PPARgamma agonists as one of the most interesting and widely studied anticancer molecules. Although PPARgamma agonists exert significant, antiproliferative and tumoricidal activity in vitro, their anticancer efficacy in animal models is ambiguous, and their effectiveness in clinical trials in monotherapy is unsatisfactory. However, due to pleiotropic effects of PPARgamma activation in normal and tumor cells, PPARgamma ligands interact with many antitumor treatment modalities and synergistically potentiate their effectiveness. The most spectacular example is a combination of PPARgamma ligands with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this setting, PPARgamma activation sensitizes leukemic stem cells, resistant to any previous form of treatment, to targeted therapy. Thus, this combination is believed to be the first pharmacological therapy able to cure CML patients. Within the last decade, a significant body of data confirming the benefits of the addition of PPARgamma ligands to various antitumor therapies, including chemotherapy, hormonotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, has been published. Although the majority of these studies have been carried out in vitro or animal tumor models, a few successful attempts to introduce PPARgamma ligands into anticancer therapy in humans have been recently made. In this review, we aim to summarize shines and shadows of targeting PPARgamma in antitumor therapies.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Mrowka, Piotr', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka, Eliza']","['Mrowka P', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka E']",,"['Department of Biophysics and Human Physiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,['0 (PPAR gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*PPARgamma ligand', '*Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma', '*cancer', '*combination therapy', '*imatinib', '*leukemia', '*thiazolidinediones', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors.']",2019/12/10 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/12/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-102832 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009619666191209102015 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2020;20(3):197-215. doi: 10.2174/1568009619666191209102015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These methods share an assumption that two mutations arise from the same subclone if they have similar mutant allele-frequencies (MAFs), and thus it is difficult or impossible to distinguish two subclones with similar MAFs. Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) data can be very informative for ITH inference. However, due to the difficulty of DNA amplification, scDNA-seq data are often very noisy. A promising new study design is to collect both bulk and single-cell DNA-seq data and jointly analyze them to mitigate the limitations of each data type. To address the analytic challenges of this new study design, we propose a computational method named BaSiC (Bulk tumor and Single Cell), to discern ITH by jointly analyzing DNA-seq data from bulk tumor and single cells. We demonstrate that BaSiC has comparable or better performance than the methods using either data type.

METHODS: In the first place, four kinds of mice models were established, namely, SHAM group (n=30), trauma (TH) group (n=30), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group (n=30) and TH+LPS group (n=30). Their lung, spleen and liver tissues were gathered for determination of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and MCP-1 levels. Furthermore, mouse mononuclear macrophage leukemia cell line (RAW264.7) was stimulated by LPS to establish inflammation cell models. Then si-NEAT1s, pcDNA3.1-NEAT1, miR-495-3p mimic, miR-495-3p inhibitor, miR-NC, miR-211 mimic and miR-211 inhibitor were, respectively, transfected into the cells, so as to observe the impacts of NEAT1, miR-495-3p and miR-211 on cytokine levels released by the cells. RESULTS: The survival condition of mice in the TH+LPS group was undesirable, in relative to mice in the LPS group and SHAM group (both P<0.05). High-level NEAT1 and low-level miR-495-3p/miR-211 were associated with poor survival of mice in the TH+LPS group (P<0.05). Additionally, the correlation between NEAT1/miR-495-3p/miR-211 level and cytokine level was the strongest among TH+LPS-treated mice, in comparison to mice treated by TH or LPS. Furthermore, up-regulation of NEAT1 level and down-regulation of miR-495-3p/miR-211 level could aggravate inflammation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. The miR-495-3p and miR-211 herein, were both subjected to sponging of NEAT1, possibly affected inflammation responses in RAW264.7 cells, respectively, through modulating STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling. CONCLUSION: LncRNA NEAT1 exhibited great potential sepsis diagnosis and treatment, considering its modifying miR-495-3p/STAT3 axis and miR-211/PI3K/AKT axis in inflammation cell models.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TDM in CML entails the measurement of plasma tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) concentration to predict efficacy and tolerability outcomes and to aid in clinical decision making. TDM was to be deemed useful if it could be used for predicting the effectiveness of a drug and/or the occurrence of adverse reactions. It was expected that the findings from the present study would allow for the definition of a therapeutic range of each TKI. METHODS: A systematic review of studies reporting trough TKI levels (Cmin) and clinical outcomes was performed. We included randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized controlled studies, interrupted time series studies, and case series studies that provided information about plasma levels of imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib and relevant clinical end points in adult patients with chronic-phase CML treated with the corresponding TKI as the single antiproliferative therapy. Meta-analyses, Student t tests, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to detect mean differences between groups of patients with or without: (1) the achievement of major molecular response and (2) adverse reactions. FINDINGS: A total of 38 studies (28 for imatinib, 7 for nilotinib, and 3 for dasatinib) were included in the systematic review. TDM was found useful in predicting the efficacy of imatinib, with a Cmin cutoff value of 1000 ng/mL, consistent with guideline recommendations. We suggest a therapeutic range of imatinib at a Cmin of 1000-1500 ng/mL because higher concentrations did not increase efficacy. The findings from the rest of the comparisons were inconclusive. IMPLICATIONS: TDM is useful in predicting the efficacy of imatinib in CML. Further research is needed to determine its validity with nilotinib and dasatinib.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several electronic databases were searched in of EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science (published up to November 2017) to obtain eligible studies. The pooled Hazard Ratio (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) as the primary and secondary endpoint, respectively, were chosen and extracted to determine the prognostic impact of SF3B1 mutations and to compare SF3B1 mutations to those with wild-type. Nine cohort studies with a total of 2259 patients were obtained, and the pooled HRs for OS was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.56-1.52, p-value = 0.78) and revealed no significant effect on overall survival of MDS patients by random effect models.

PCSK9 interferes with LDL metabolism and causes dyslipidemias in hematological malignancies particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nutraceuticals like berberine, curcumin and polydatin have been found effective in modulating PCSK9 expression by lowering LDL levels. Eugenol, a nutraceutical has shown a promising role in cancer due to its antioxidant and antihypercholesterolemic effects. In the present study, PCSK9 expression was measured in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and was found to be significantly induced. Based on the results of expression analysis, a plausible hypothesis was made. Eugenol being an antioxidant will prevent oxidation of LDL. In the absence of ox-LDL, LOX1 scavenger receptor, which regulates PCSK9 expression, will not be activated. As the circulating LDL is reduced, it will no longer be able to support leukemia cell growth. The hypothesis was validated by an in silico and in vitro study. Molecular docking revealed hydrophobic interactions between ligand eugenol and macromolecules PCSK9 and LOX1. Expression of both PCSK9 and LOX1 were significantly reduced by eugenol in Jurkat cells.

Therapeutic concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can restore retinoid-induced transcription and promote degradation of the PML-RARalpha protein. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway that utilizes lysosomal machinery to degrade intracellular material and facilitate cellular re-modeling. Recent studies have identified autophagy as an integral component of ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation. METHODS: As the molecular communication between retinoid signaling and the autophagy pathway is not defined, we performed RNA sequencing of NB4 APL cells treated with ATRA and examined autophagy-related transcripts. RESULTS: ATRA altered the expression of >80 known autophagy-related transcripts, including the key transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB (11.5-fold increase). Induction of TFEB and its transcriptional target, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, p62), is reduced in ATRA-resistant NB4R cells compared to NB4 cells. TFEB knockdown in NB4 cells alters the expression of transcriptional targets of TFEB and reduces CD11b transcript levels in response to ATRA. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that TFEB plays an important role in ATRA-induced autophagy during myeloid differentiation and that autophagy induction potentiates leukemic cell differentiation (Note: this study includes data obtained from NCT00195156, https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00195156).",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The haematologist suffers a lot to discriminate the presence of leukaemia in the patients using the blood smears. To overcome the inaccuracy and reliability issues, this paper proposes an automatic method of leukaemia detection, named chronological Sine Cosine Algorithm-based actor-critic neural network (Chrono-SCA-ACNN). Initially, the blood smear images are segmented using the proposed entropy-based hybrid model, from which the image-level features and statistical features are extracted from the segments. Then, the selected features are applied to the proposed classifier, which detects the leukaemia. In the proposed Chrono-SCA-ACNN, the optimal weights are selected by the proposed Chrono-SCA, which is the integration of the chronological concept in the SCA. Finally, the experimentation is performed using the ALL-IDB2 database, and the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing methods is evaluated. From the analysis, the accuracy of the proposed method is found to be 0.99, which proves that it outperforms the existing classification methodologies. Graphical abstract Block diagram of proposed Leukaemia detection. The main aim of the paper is to segment and classify the WBCs for ALL detection in single cell blood smear images. Initially, the blood smear image is subjected to pre-processing in order to enhance the quality of the input image so as to make it effective for the further processes associated with Leukaemia detection. The pre-processed image is applied to the segmentation process that segments the cytoplasm and nucleus using the Entropy-based hybrid model. The entropy-based hybrid model is developed using the FCM and active contour to segment the cytoplasm and nucleus that is fused using the entropy. The segments are subjected to the feature extraction that extracts the statistical features and the color histogram-based features from the segments. The features are presented to the Actor-Critic Neural Network and the weights of the Neural Network (NN) are optimally tuned using the proposed Chrono-SCA.

The last decade has seen significant advances in targeted therapy with immunotherapy and molecular therapeutics, as well as advances in risk stratification for therapy based on somatic and germline genetic analysis and monitoring of minimal residual disease. For immunotherapy, the approval of antibody-based therapy (with blinatumomab in 2014 and inotuzumab ozogamicin in 2017) and T cell-based therapy (with tisagenlecleucel in 2017) by the US Food and Drug Administration has significantly improved the response rate and outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.

Here, we test whether leukemia cells can be reprogrammed in vivo using the canonical reprogramming transcription factors-Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (termed as OSKM). Unexpectedly, we discover that OSKM can eradicate leukemia cells and dramatically improve survival of leukemia-bearing mice. By contrast, OSKM minimally impact normal hematopoietic cells. Using ATAC-seq, we find OSKM induce chromatin accessibility near genes encoding apoptotic regulators in leukemia cells. Moreover, this selective effect also involves downregulation of H3K9me3 as an early event. Dissection of the functional effects of OSKM shows that Klf4 and Sox2 play dominant roles compared to c-Myc and Oct4 in elimination of leukemia cells.

It is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of precursor plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with morphologic and molecular similarities to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in its presentation within the bone marrow and peripheral blood. To identify disease-specific molecular features of BPDCN, we profiled the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and serum samples from primary patient samples using an in-house hematologic malignancy panel (""T300"" panel), transcriptome microarray, and serum multiplex immunoassays. TET2 mutations (5/8, 63%) were the most prevalent in our cohort. Using the transcriptome microarray, genes specific to pDCs (LAMP5, CCDC50) were more highly expressed in BPDCN than in AML specimens. Finally, the serum cytokine profile analysis showed significantly elevated levels of eosinophil chemoattractants eotaxin and RANTES in BPDCN as compared with AML. Along with the high levels of PTPRS and dendritic nature of the tumor cells, these findings suggest a possible pre-inflammatory context of this disease, in which BPDCN features nonactivated pDCs.",,"['Beird, Hannah C', 'Khan, Maliha', 'Wang, Feng', 'Alfayez, Mansour', 'Cai, Tianyu', 'Zhao, Li', 'Khoury, Joseph', 'Futreal, P Andrew', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['Beird HC', 'Khan M', 'Wang F', 'Alfayez M', 'Cai T', 'Zhao L', 'Khoury J', 'Futreal PA', 'Konopleva M', 'Pemmaraju N']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5078-534X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2621-3584']","['Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. npemmaraju@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191206,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Phenotype', 'Protein Array Analysis']",PMC6898719,,,,2019/12/08 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/12/08 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0262-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0262-0 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2019 Dec 6;9(12):99. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0262-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to define the causes of double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in children and adults, and to identify simple clinical and laboratory features that would help to differentiate between the underlying conditions. METHODS: We collected clinical and laboratory data on 10 children and 30 adults with significantly increased peripheral-blood double-negative T-cells (>10% of total lymphocytes). We identified conditions associated with double-negative T-lymphocytosis with flow cytometry, peripheral-blood morphology and T-cell receptor-gene rearrangement studies. Patients were assigned to diagnostic categories on the basis of these test results. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The causes of double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in children were autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and reactive gamma/delta Tau-lymphocytosis. T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukaemia, reactive gamma/delta T-lymphocytosis and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) were the the most common disorders underlying double-negative T-cell lymphocytosis in adults. Less common causes included hypereosinophilic syndrome, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, ALPS and monoclonal, double-negative T-lymphocytosis of uncertain significance. CD5/CD7/Vdelta2 expression and absolute double-negative lymphocyte count (<1.8x10(9)/L) were useful discriminators for distinguishing patients with reactive gamma/delta T-lymphocytosis from those with gamma/delta lymphoproliferative disorders. Differentiating between gamma/delta T-LGL and HSTL can be difficult. Expression of CD57 and cellular morphology (pale cytoplasm with distinct granules) would support a diagnosis of gamma/delta T-LGL.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

More than 95% of CML patients are diagnosed with the e13a2 or e14a2 BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts while, in about 1% of these individuals, the break generates the e1a2 rearrangement. Furthermore, about 5% of CML patients are diagnosed with rare BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts, such as e19a2, e8a2, e13a3, e14a3, e1a3 and e6a2. However, there is limited evidence concerning the clinical and prognostic implications of these infrequent oncogenic variants for CML patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). CASE REPORT: We describe a novel atypical e12a2 insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) BCR-ABL1 fusion identified in a CML 59-year-old man diagnosed with a common e13a2 BCR-ABL1 isoform. The use of primers recognizing more distant exons from the common BCR-ABL1 breakpoint region correctly identified and monitored in time the atypical e12a2 Ins/Del BCR-ABL1 fusion. CONCLUSION: Treatment with second- (nilotinib) and third-generation (ponatinib) TKIs was effective in suppressing leukemic clones exhibiting the atypical e12a2 Ins/Del BCR-ABL1.","['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Stella, Stefania', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Accurso, Vincenzo', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'DI Gregorio, Sandra', 'Romano, Chiara', 'DI Raimondo, Francesco', 'Siragusa, Sergio', 'Manzella, Livia']","['Stella S', 'Massimino M', 'Tirro E', 'Vitale SR', 'Accurso V', 'Puma A', 'Pennisi MS', 'DI Gregorio S', 'Romano C', 'DI Raimondo F', 'Siragusa S', 'Manzella L']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy stefania.stel@gmail.com.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

There is a lack of studies assessing the outcome of T-ALL in Hispanic populations, in which it is a rare malignancy. We report the characteristics and results of treatment for childhood T-cell ALL in children over 14 years at a Latin American reference center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2018, there occurred the analysis of twenty patients </= 16 years of age from a low-income open population diagnosed at a university hospital in Northeast Mexico. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment regimens and outcomes were assessed by scrutinizing clinical records and electronic databases. Diagnosis was confirmed by flow cytometry, including positivity for CD-2, 5, 7 and surface/cytoplasmic CD3. Survival rates were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: There was a male preponderance (70 %), with a 2.3 male-to-female ratio (p= .074), the median age being 9.5 years. Leucocytes at diagnosis were >/= 50x10(9)/L in 13 (65 %) children, with CNS infiltration in 6 (30 %) and organomegaly in 10 (50 %). The five-year overall survival (OS) was 44.3 % (95 % CI 41.96-46.62), significantly lower in girls, at 20.8 % (95 % CI 17.32-24.51) vs. 53.1 % (95 % CI 50.30-55.82), (p=.035) in boys; there was no sex difference in the event-free survival (EFS) (p=.215). The survival was significantly higher after 2010 (p=.034). CONCLUSION: The T-cell ALL was more frequent in boys, had a higher mortality in girls and the survival has increased over the last decade with improved chemotherapy and supportive care.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

STUDY DESIGN: In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO number, CRD42018087289), we searched PubMed and Embase to identify relevant studies. We included human studies that reported associations of at least one measure of maternal infection during pregnancy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or all childhood leukemias in the offspring. One reviewer extracted the data first using a standardized form, and the second reviewer independently checked the data for accuracy. Two reviewers used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the quality of included studies. We conducted random effects meta-analyses to pool the ORs of specific type of infection on ALL and childhood leukemia. RESULTS: This review included 20 studies (ALL, n = 15; childhood leukemia, n = 14) reported in 32 articles. Most (>65%) included studies reported a positive association between infection variables and ALL or childhood leukemia. Among specific types of infection, we found that influenza during pregnancy was associated with higher risk of ALL (pooled OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.34-9.90) and childhood leukemia (pooled OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.01-3.11). Varicella (pooled OR, 10.19; 95% CI, 1.98-52.39) and rubella (pooled OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.16-6.71) infections were also associated with higher childhood leukemia risk.

DNA repair defects and synthetic lethality with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition occur in IDH mutant glioma and leukemia models. Here we evaluated DNA repair and PARP inhibition, alone or combined with chemo- or radiotherapy, in chondrosarcoma cell lines with or without endogenous IDH mutations. Chondrosarcoma cell lines treated with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib were examined for dose-response relationships, as well as underlying cell death mechanisms and DNA repair functionality. Talazoparib was combined with chemo- or radiotherapy to evaluate potential synergy. Cell lines treated long term with an inhibitor normalizing D-2-HG levels were investigated for synthetic lethality with talazoparib. We report that talazoparib sensitivity was variable and irrespective of IDH mutation status. All cell lines expressed Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), but a subset was impaired in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) capacity, homologous recombination, and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression. Talazoparib synergized with temozolomide or radiation, independent of IDH1 mutant inhibition. This study suggests that talazoparib combined with temozolomide or radiation are promising therapeutic strategies for chondrosarcoma, irrespective of IDH mutation status. A subset of chondrosarcomas may be deficient in nonclassical DNA repair pathways, suggesting that PARP inhibitor sensitivity is multifactorial in chondrosarcoma.",,"['Venneker, Sanne', 'Kruisselbrink, Alwine B', 'Briaire-de Bruijn, Inge H', 'de Jong, Yvonne', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Danen, Erik H J', 'Bovee, Judith V M G']","['Venneker S', 'Kruisselbrink AB', 'Briaire-de Bruijn IH', 'de Jong Y', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Danen EHJ', 'Bovee JVMG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4067-9818', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9778-4432', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4458-0946', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0491-6345', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1155-0481']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Drug Discovery and Safety, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, 2333 CC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['UL2013-6103/KWF Kankerbestrijding'],['Journal Article'],20191202,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6966531,,['NOTNLM'],"['AGI-5198', 'D-2-hydroxyglutarate', 'chondrosarcoma', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'radiotherapy', 'sarcoma', 'talazoparib', 'temozolomide']",2019/12/08 06:00,2019/12/08 06:01,['2019/12/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11121918 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11121918 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Dec 2;11(12). pii: cancers11121918. doi: 10.3390/cancers11121918.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of acetylshikonin on human chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) cells apoptosis and its detailed mechanisms remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether acetylshikonin could inhibit proliferation or induce apoptosis of the K562 cells, and whether by regulating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway to suppress the development of CML. K562 cells were treated with serial diluted acetylshikonin at different concentrations. Our data showed that K562 cell growth was significantly inhibited by acetylshikonin with an IC50 of 2.03muM at 24h and 1.13muM at 48h, with increased cell cycle arrest in S-phase. The results of annexin V-FITC/PI and AO/EB staining showed that acetylshikonin induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. K562 cells treated with acetylshikonin underwent massive apoptosis accompanied by a rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scavenging the ROS completely blocked the induction of apoptosis following acetylshikonin treatment. The levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 increased with increased concentrations of acetylshikonin, while the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated. The levels of Cyt C and AIF, which are characteristic proteins of the mitochondria-regulated intrinsic apoptotic pathway, also increased in the cytosol after acetylshikonin treatment. However, the mitochondrial fraction of Cyt C and AIF were decreased under acetylshikonin treatment. In addition, acetylshikonin decreased Bcr-Abl expression and inhibited its downstream signaling. Acetylshikonin could lead to a blockage of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway via decreasing nuclear NF-kappaB P65 and increasing cytoplasmic NF-kappaB P65. Moreover, acetylshikonin significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of IkBalpha and IKKalpha/beta in K562 cells. These results demonstrated that acetylshikonin significantly inhibited K562 cell growth and induced cell apoptosis through the mitochondria-regulated intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The mechanisms may involve the modulating ROS accumulation, inhibition of NF-kappaB and BCR-ABL expression. The inhibition of BCR-ABL expression and the inactivation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway caused by acetylshikonin treatment resulted in K562 cell apoptosis. Together, our results indicate that acetylshikonin could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the future treatment of CML.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Ghrelin is a hormone with various functions including stimulation of the release of growth hormone and autophagy in cancer cells. Moreover, SIRT1 and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) stimulate expression of proteins involved in autophagy. On the other hand, autophagic cell death can be an alternative target for cancer therapy, in the absence of apoptosis. The relationship between ghrelin and the SIRT1/AMPK axis and the resulting effects on autophagy, apoptosis, proliferation, and expression of CXCR4 and the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a), in Jurkat and Molt-4 human lymphoblastic cell lines was not previously clear. Here we demonstrate that SIRT1 expression is upregulated during the induction of autophagy by ghrelin, an effect that is inhibited by inactivation of SIRT1/AMPK axis. In addition, ghrelin can affect CXCR4 and GHS-R1a expression. In conclusion, this work reveals that ghrelin induces autophagy, invasion, and downregulation of ghrelin receptor expression via the SIRT1/AMPK axis in lymphoblastic cell lines. However, in these cell lines ghrelin-induced autophagy does not lead to cell death due to weak induction of apoptosis.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Today, state-of-the-art AML diagnostics relies on cytomorphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetics. Only the integration of all of these methods allows for a comprehensive and complementary characterisation of each case, which is prerequisite for optimal AML diagnosis and management. Here, we will review why multidisciplinary diagnostics is mandatory today and will gain even more importance in the future, especially in the context of precision medicine. We will discuss ideas and strategies that are likely to shape and improve multidisciplinary diagnostics in AML and may even overcome some of today's gold standards. This includes recent technical advances that provide genome-wide molecular insights. The enormous amount of data obtained by these latter techniques represents a great challenge, but also a unique chance. We will reflect on how this increase in knowledge can be incorporated into the routine to pave the way for personalised medicine in AML.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using posttransplant cyclophosphamide is associated with low rates of severe graft-versus-host disease and nonrelapse mortality and does not require graft manipulation or storage, which results in a low graft acquisition cost. Its remarkable safety when used with reduced-intensity conditioning has been demonstrated in patients up to 75 years old with outcomes similar to those of patients in their 50s. Several large, registry-based retrospective studies have confirmed the efficacy of HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with posttransplant cyclophosphamide, achieving results comparable to those of HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

When applied in clinical trials, molecular and immunophenotypic MRD assays have improved prognostic precision, providing a strong rationale for their use to guide treatment, as well as to measure its effectiveness. Initiatives such as those from the European Leukemia Network now provide a collaborative knowledge-based framework for selection and implementation of MRD assays most appropriate for defined genetic subgroups. For patients with mutated-NPM1 AML, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) monitoring of mutated-NPM1 transcripts postinduction and sequentially after treatment has emerged as a highly sensitive and specific tool to predict relapse and potential benefit from allogeneic transplant. Flow cytometric MRD after induction is prognostic across genetic risk groups and can identify those patients in the wild-type NPM1 intermediate AML subgroup with a very high risk for relapse. In parallel with these data, advances in genetic profiling have extended understanding of the etiology and the complex dynamic clonal nature of AML, as well as created the opportunity for MRD monitoring using next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS AML MRD detection can stratify outcomes and has potential utility in the peri-allogeneic transplant setting. However, there remain challenges inherent in the NGS approach of multiplex quantification of mutations to track AML MRD. Although further development of this methodology, together with orthogonal testing, will clarify its relevance for routine clinical use, particularly for patients lacking a qPCR genetic target, established validated MRD assays can already provide information to direct clinical practice.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

Older HL patients appear to have different disease biology compared with younger patients, including increased incidence of mixed cellularity histology, Epstein-Barr virus-related, and advanced-stage disease. For prognostication, several studies have documented the significance of comorbidities and functional status in older HL patients, as well as the importance of achieving initial complete remission. Collectively, selection of therapy for older HL patients should be based in part on functional status, including pretreatment assessment of activities of daily living (ADL), comorbidities, and other geriatric measures (eg, cognition, social support). Treatment of fit older HL patients should be given with curative intent, regardless of disease stage. However, attention should be paid to serious treatment-related toxicities, including risk of treatment-related mortality. Although inclusion of anthracycline therapy is important, bleomycin-containing regimens (eg, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) may lead to prohibitive pulmonary toxicity, and intensive therapies (eg, bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone) are too toxic. Brentuximab vedotin given sequentially before and after doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine to fit, untreated advanced-stage older HL patients was recently shown to be tolerable and highly effective. Therapy for patients who are unfit or frail because of comorbidities and/or ADL loss is less clear and should be individualized with consideration of lower-intensity therapy, such as brentuximab vedotin with or without dacarbazine. Altogether, therapy for older HL patients should be tailored based upon a geriatric assessment, and novel targeted agents should continue to be integrated into treatment paradigms.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

Accumulating evidence over the last few years indicates that not only primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), but also cells defining the microenvironment of the BM (BM niche), sense hematopoietic stress signals. They respond by directing and orchestrating hematopoiesis via not only cell-intrinsic but also cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Inflammation has many beneficial roles by activating the immune system in tissue repair and as a defense mechanism. However, chronic inflammation can have detrimental effects by stressing HSPCs, leading to cell (DNA) damage resulting in BM failure or even to leukemia. Emerging data have demonstrated that the BM microenvironment plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies, in particular, through disrupted inflammatory signaling, specifically in niche (microenvironmental) cells. Clonal selection in the context of microenvironmental alterations can occur in the context of toxic insults (eg, chemotherapy), not only aging but also inflammation. In this review, we summarize mechanisms that lead to an inflammatory BM microenvironment and discuss how this affects normal hematopoiesis. We pay particular attention to the process of aging, which is known to involve low-grade inflammation and is also associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis and potentially malignant transformation.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

Careful consideration must be given to host susceptibility to DNA damage when selecting a transplant strategy, because significant dose reductions and avoidance of radiation are necessary. Transplantation before evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is optimal, because outcomes of AML are extremely poor. Children and adults can present with germline mutations in GATA2 and RUNX1, both of which are associated with a 30% to 40% chance of evolution to MDS. GATA2 deficiency may be associated with a clinically important degree of immune suppression, which can cause severe infections that can complicate transplant strategies. GATA2 and RUNX1 deficiency is not associated with host susceptibility to DNA damage, and therefore, conventional treatment strategies for MDS and AML can be used.

However, the situation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may not be so rosy. Many important differences in hematological cancers, including CML, have been highlighted in various publications in LMICs vs developed countries. These include differences in incidence and prevalence rates, age and stage of disease at diagnosis, response rates, and survival. Some of the possible reasons proposed for these are varying socioeconomic milieu (impacting availability of effective drugs and essential monitoring), environmental factors (mainly exposure to viral infections and pesticides), nutritional factors with interplay of malnutrition and diet on drug absorption and blood levels, and possible unknown genetic factors. Although generic first-generation TKIs (imatinib) are available in many parts of the world, several challenges remain in providing optimal treatment to patients with CML in resource-poor countries. Some of these include availability of optimal and high-quality BCR/ABL testing, availability and expense related to use of second- and third-generation TKIs (nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, issues with compliance and toxicities of drugs, and ensuring a minimal standard-of-care treatment and monitoring for every patient diagnosed with CML.

Glasdegib, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor, may be used in combination with LDAC for the same indication and improves survival compared with LDAC alone.

These may include induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (autoHCT) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT). However, it is not always clear how to best deliver these therapies, in terms of determining treatment eligibility, as well as adjusting or adding supportive measures to the treatment plan to maximize successful outcomes. Beyond performance status and presence of comorbidities, comprehensive geriatric assessment and individual geriatric metrics have increasingly been used to prognosticate in these settings and may offer the best approach to personalizing therapy. In the setting of AML induction, evidence supports the use of measures of physical function as independent predictors of survival. For patients undergoing alloHCT, functional status, as measured by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and gait speed, may be an important pretransplant assessment. IADL has also been associated with post-autoHCT morbidity and mortality.

These agents target either CD19 or CD22, which are both expressed on the surface of the leukemic blasts in the majority of patients. The use of these agents has greatly transformed the landscape of available treatment, and it has provided curative therapy in some patients. As the field has matured, we are learning that for most patients, the currently available immunotherapies are not curative. Leukemic resistance to both CD19 and CD22 pressure has been described and is a major component of developed resistance to these therapies. Patients with B-ALL have developed CD19- or CD22-negative B-ALL, and in more rare cases, they have undergone lineage switch to acute myeloid leukemia. Current efforts are focusing on overcoming antigen escape, either by forced antigen expression or by dual-targeting therapies. A functional immune system is also required for maximal benefit of immunotherapy, particularly with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. Data are now being produced that may allow for the prospective identification of patients whose immune deficits may be identified up front and predict failure. Preclinical work is focusing on additional engineering of CAR T cells to overcome these inherent immune deficits. Last, with improved knowledge of which patients are likely to benefit from immunotherapy as definitive treatment, those patients who are predicted to develop resistance may be prospectively recommended to undergo a consolidative hematopoietic cell transplant to lessen the recurrence risk.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.

Both patient and leukemia-specific characteristics assessed using morphology, cytogenetics, molecular biology, and multicolor flow cytometry are relevant at diagnosis and during induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases of the treatment. In particular, minimal residual disease (MRD) during therapy has potential as a prognostic factor of outcome, determination of response to therapy, and direction of targeted therapy. MRD can be determined by cell surface markers using multicolor flow cytometry, whereas leukemia-specific translocations and mutations are measured using polymerase chain reaction-based techniques and recently using next-generation sequencing. All these methods of MRD detection have their (dis)advantages, and all need to be standardized, prospectively validated, and improved to be used for uniform clinical decision making and a potential surrogate end point for clinical trials testing novel treatment strategies. Important issues to be solved are time point of MRD measurement and threshold for MRD positivity. MRD is used for stem cell transplantation (SCT) selection in the large subgroup of patients with an intermediate risk profile. Patients who are MRD positive will benefit from allo-SCT. However, MRD-negative patients have a better chance of survival after SCT. Therefore, it is debated whether MRD-positive patients should be extensively treated to become MRD negative before SCT. Either way, accurate monitoring of potential residual or upcoming disease is mandatory.

This review provides an overview of the mechanisms forming the basis of relapse, including clonal evolution, gain of tropism for privileged sites, genomic and nongenomic changes in the HLA asset, and enforcement of immune checkpoints.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the utility of a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay in AML as well as correlations of CNAs with various biological and clinical features of patients with AML, including somatic mutations in the FLT3, NPM1, and DNMT3A genes and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 283 patients with AML. The MLPA was used for investigation of CNAs. The status of somatic mutations was analyzed in all cases. RESULTS: The presence of CNAs was associated with the adverse (high) risk category according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification (PFDR <0.0001). The significant predictors of mortality were age of 65 years or older (hazard ratio [HR], 2.30; 95% CI, 1.71-3.09), ELN highrisk category (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.15-2.56), and the Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group Scale (ECOG) performance status grade of 3 or higher (HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.80-3.30), but not the presence of CNA. An interaction between CNAs and the ECOG performance status was shown (HRinteraction, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.09-4.57, P = 0.02). The presence of CNAs was positively correlated with the risk of death in patients with an ECOG grade of 3 or higher (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.30-3.12), while for patients with the performance status of 2 or lower, the presence of CNAs was a protective factor against the risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CNAs may modify the effect of the ECOG performance status on survival.

Predictors of long-term outcome following ICH are unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included adult patients with acute leukemia and ICH over an 8-year period. The primary outcome was data regarding 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included data related to the proportion of patients receiving post-remission therapy and predictors of 90-day mortality. RESULTS: ICH occurred in 101 patients; 12 patients died within 72 hours. For the 89 others, 90-day mortality was 40%. Of 43 patients who received induction, 30 achieved remission and 26 received post-remission therapy. Older age (p = 0.03) and higher white count (p = 0.02) at the time of ICH were predictive of inferior survival. During 90-day follow-up, median platelet count was 37 x 10(9) /L (0-1526 x 10(9) /L). Lower platelet count during follow-up was predictive of 90-day mortality (p = <0.01). Twenty-one percent of platelet transfusions were provided when the platelet count was less than 10 x 10(9) /L, 54% between 10 and 29 x 10(9) /L, and 25% greater than 30 x 10(9) /L. New or progressive ICH occurred in 23 patients. There was no difference in the median platelet transfusion trigger between patients who had new or progressive ICH and those who did not. CONCLUSION: In patients with acute leukemia, survival following ICH is poor. Older age and higher white count is associated with increased mortality, perhaps reflecting higher risk disease. Following ICH in acute leukemia platelet transfusions do not appear to alter the risk of progressive bleeding or mortality.",['(c) 2019 AABB.'],"['Nixon, Shannon', 'Lieberman, Lani', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Doherty, Mary', 'Murray, Cindy', 'Wolfe, Amanda', 'Brandys, Danielle', 'Rowland, Suzanne', 'Kwan, Benjamin Ym', 'Yu, Eugene', 'Lechner, Breanne', 'Maze, Dawn']","['Nixon S', 'Lieberman L', 'Atenafu EG', 'Doherty M', 'Murray C', 'Wolfe A', 'Brandys D', 'Rowland S', 'Kwan BY', 'Yu E', 'Lechner B', 'Maze D']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4598-9380'],"['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191206,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/*therapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/12/07 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2019/12/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15621 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2020 Feb;60(2):269-274. doi: 10.1111/trf.15621.

Recent clinical trials have suggested a possible association between idelalisib treatment and development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to John Cunningham virus (JCV) reactivation. Nevertheless, clinical course and radiological and pathological features of idelalisib-induced PML still need to be clarified. We provide here the first clinicopathological description of idelalisib-associated PML in a patient who developed epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) as the first manifestation of the disease. Since EPC could present without electroencephalogram alterations, it is crucial to recognize the clinical features of this epileptic condition. EPC is characterized by the presence of repetitive, irregular, clonic jerking, often associated with hemiparesis and involvement of distal rather than proximal muscle groups. Moreover, we highlight the importance of brain biopsy in selected cases when there is a high clinical suspicion of PML, despite negative JCV testing in the cerebrospinal fluid.

In this systematic review, we searched different databases (PubMed, ASH, ASCO, and SIOP) for studies published from 2008 to 2018 that evaluated the prognostic impact of miRNAs in childhood ALL. We also used DIANA-miRPath v3.0 to further characterize the functional role of the significant prognostic miRNAs identified in our systematic review. Here we evaluate 15 studies with a total of 38 different miRNAs and 1545 children with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) or T-cell ALL (T-ALL) recruited over approximately 3 decades (1984-2016) with different treatment protocols and ethnicities. Out of the 15 studies examined, 14 reported 32 dysregulated miRNAs with significant prognostic impact in pediatric ALL patients. Only one Brazilian study reported no significant prognostic effect of 7 miRNAs, while the seventh miRNA (miR-100) showed prognostic significance in a Chinese study. Using DIANA-TarBase v7.0 of DIANA-miRPath v3.0, pathway enrichment analysis revealed 25 miRNAs modulated 24 molecular pathways involved in cancer development. To remove the effect of salvage therapy, 9 studies carried out multivariate cox regression analysis for both relapse-free survival and disease-free survival to develop a panel of 23 miRNAs acting as independent prognostic biomarkers. To enhance the clinical application, utility, and validity of the miRNAs discussed here, their potential prognostic value should be confirmed in larger cohort studies within different ethnicities and different ALL protocols adjusted for other contemporary validated prognostic factors in childhood ALL.",,"['Rashed, Wafaa M', 'Hamza, Mahmoud M', 'Matboli, Marwa', 'Salem, Sherin I']","['Rashed WM', 'Hamza MM', 'Matboli M', 'Salem SI']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7531-2840'],"[""Clinical Trials Unit, Clinical Research, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt-57357 (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt. wafaaanor@gmail.com."", ""Biostatistics Unit, Clinical Research, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt-57357 (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', ""Cytogenetics Department, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt-57357 (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*MicroRNA', '*Prognostic biomarker']",2019/12/07 06:00,2020/02/28 06:00,['2019/12/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10555-019-09826-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10555-019-09826-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2019 Dec;38(4):771-782. doi: 10.1007/s10555-019-09826-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asparagine synthetase (ASNS), legumain (LGMN) and cathepsin B (CTSB) serve a key role in L-asp resistance. The association between genetic subtypes of BCP-ALL and the expression of ASNS, LGMN and CTSB may elucidate the mechanisms of treatment failure. Bone marrow samples of 52 children newly diagnosed with BCP-ALL were screened for major genetic abnormalities and ASNS, LGMN and CTSB gene expression levels. The cohort was further divided into groups corresponding to the key genetic aberrations occurring in BCP-ALL: Breakpoint cluster region and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 fusion; hyperdiploidy, hypodiploidy, ETS variant 6 and runt-related transcription factor 1 fusion and other BCP-ALL with no primary genetic aberration identified. A subgroup analysis based on the differences in copy number variations demonstrated a significant increase of ASNS, LGMN and CTSB median expression in other BCP-ALL cases with paired box 5 (PAX5) deletion (P=0.0117; P=0.0036; P<0.0001, respectively) compared with those with wild-type PAX5. Patients with high ASNS expression exhibited longer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with those with low ASNS levels (P=0.0315; HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.86); the 5-year RFS for patients in the high ASNS expression group was 90.15% (95% CI, 87.90-92.40%). Despite the impact on ASNS, LGMN and CTSB expression, PAX5 deletion did not influence RFS in the other BCP-ALL group (P=0.6839). Therefore, the results of the present study revealed high levels of ASNS, LGMN and CTSB expression in the other BCP-ALL group with concomitant PAX5 deletion and no subsequent deterioration in 5-year RFS.

Patients with an FLT3-ITD mutation have a poor prognosis. However, the prognostic function of FLT3-ITD combined with other cytogenetic abnormalities are not clear. In the present study, a retrospective analysis of 103 newly diagnosed patients with AML was performed. The results revealed that the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) times were significantly longer in patients with an FLT3-ITD mutation combined with other favorable risk genes, compared with in those patients with a single FLT3-ITD mutation (P=0.0361 and P=0.0426).

Trisomy 9 as a secondary chromosome change in patients with t(9;11) is relatively rare. The present study reported a unique case of AML with a chromosome 9 trisomy secondary to t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3) through the cytogenetic analysis of leukemic blood and bone marrow. Further characterization with fluorescence in situ hybridization and array comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed that this extra chromosome 9 was either a copy of normal chromosome 9 or a derivative chromosome 9. Conversely with the previously reported favorable outcome of AML patients with t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3), in the present study, the cells with only translocation persisted, whereas the cells with an extra chromosome 9 disappeared following initial chemotherapy.

This study aimed to explore the clinical-biological characteristics of pediatric pro-B ALL and factors associated with outcomes. Methods: This study enrolled 121 pediatric patients aged 6 months to 14 years with newly diagnosed CD19(+)CD10(-) pro-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pro-B ALL) treated at Beijing Children's Hospital from March 2003 to October 2018. Genetic abnormalities, immunophenotypic markers, minimal residual disease (MRD) at early treatment stage and long-term outcomes of children treated on two consecutive protocols were analyzed. Results: KMT2A rearrangements were the most frequent abnormalities (incidence rate 33.06%), and were associated with lower frequency of CD13, CD33, CD22 and CD34 expression and higher frequency of CD7 and NG2 expression. Higher frequency of CD15 and CD133 expression was found in KMT2A-AFF1 (+) patients, exclusively. Presence of CD15 and absence of CD34 at diagnosis correlated with the high burden of MRD at the early stage of treatment. Outcomes were more favorable in patients older than 1 year, with absence of CD20 expression and KMT2A rearrangements, and with MRD lower than 1% at the end of induction and 0.1% before consolidation. Increased intensity of chemotherapy based on MRD analysis did not improve outcomes significantly (5-year EFS 73.9 +/- 6.5% for BCH-2003 and 76.1 +/- 5.3% for CCLG-2008, P = 0.975). Independent adverse prognostic factors were MRD >/= 0.1% before consolidation and presence of KMT2A gene rearrangements (odds ratios [ORs] 9.424 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.210, 27.662; P < 0.001]; 4.142 [1.535, 11.715, P = 0.005]; respectively). Conclusions: Pediatric pro-B ALL is a heterogeneous disease. Genetic analysis and MRD evaluation can predict patients with dismal prognosis; however, intensive chemotherapy alone does not improve outcomes of these patients and targeted therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be required.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],"['Gao, Chao', 'Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Liu, Yi', 'Liang, Jing', 'Li, Jun', 'Zhang, Yuan-Yuan', 'Yu, Jiao-Le', 'Wu,

Two methods are currently preferred for MRD evaluation in many centers: multiparameter flow cytometry and real-time quantitative PCR. Additional methods such as next-generation sequencing and digital PCR are under investigation, in an attempt to increase the sensitivity and thus allowing the detection of small clones. Many studies suggest that MRD positivity after chemotherapy is associated with negative prognosis, and the reappearance of MRD during follow-up allows impending relapse to be identified and consequently enables early intervention. Finally, MRD positivity before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is predictive of the outcome.

The 3-year OS rate of the patients in the favorable risk group, intermediate risk group and high risk group, according to the 2017 ELN risk stratification, was 50%, 28.0%, and 29.5%, respectively (p=0.374). The 3-year OS rate of patients carrying CEBPA or NPM1 mutation and those with FLT3-ITD or MLL mutation was 37.5% and 30.0%, respectively (p=0.63). The 3-year OS rate of patients employing an induction regimen of a standard IA regimen was 58.4%, and of those employing a non-standard IA regimen was 22.2% (p=0.065). The 3-year OS rate of the transplantation patients reached 73.8%, while the 9-month OS rate of patients without transplantation was 11.4% (p<0.001). Conclusion: This study suggest that hyperleukocytosis is an independent risk factor for AML patients, regardless of the risk stratification based on cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities. Age is the main factor influencing the prognosis of hyperleukocytic AML. The use of a standard IA regimen and HSCT can significantly improve the patient's prognosis.",['(c) 2019 Feng et al.'],"['Feng, Shanglong', 'Zhou, Li', 'Zhang, Xinhui', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Sun, Zimin', 'Zheng, Changcheng']","['Feng S', 'Zhou L', 'Zhang X', 'Tang B', 'Zhu X', 'Liu H', 'Sun Z', 'Zheng C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3668-3558', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1976-6415']","[""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191108,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6850690,,['NOTNLM'],"['ELN risk stratification', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'induction chemotherapy']",2019/12/07 06:00,2019/12/07 06:01,['2019/12/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S225123 [doi]', '225123 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Nov 8;11:9495-9503. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S225123. eCollection 2019.,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is of extreme importance that these cells maintain self-renewal and differentiation potential over time in order to preserve homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. Many of the intrinsic aspects of HSC are affected by the aging process resulting in a deterioration in their potential, independently of their microenvironment. Here we review recent findings characterizing most of the intrinsic aspects of aged HSC, ranging from phenotypic to molecular alterations. Historically, DNA damage was thought to be the main cause of HSC aging. However, over recent years, many new findings have defined an increasing number of biological processes that intrinsically change with age in HSC. Epigenetics and chromatin architecture, together with autophagy, proteostasis and metabolic changes, and how they are interconnected, are acquiring growing importance for understanding the intrinsic aging of stem cells. Given the increase in populations of older subjects worldwide, and considering that aging is the primary risk factor for most diseases, understanding HSC aging becomes particularly relevant also in the context of hematologic disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Research on intrinsic mechanisms responsible for HSC aging is providing, and will continue to provide, new potential molecular targets to possibly ameliorate or delay aging of the hematopoietic system and consequently improve the outcome of hematologic disorders in the elderly.

We aimed to assess whether denosumab combined with standard-of-care adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy and locoregional treatments would increase bone metastasis-free survival in women with breast cancer. METHOD: In this international, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (D-CARE), patients were recruited from 389 centres in 39 countries. We enrolled women (aged >/= 18 years) with histologically confirmed stage II or III breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. On eligibility confirmation, investigators at each site telephoned an interactive voice response system to centrally randomly assign patients (1:1) based on a fixed stratified permuted block randomisation list (block size 4) to receive either denosumab (120 mg) or matching placebo subcutaneously every 3-4 weeks, starting with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, for about 6 months and then every 12 weeks for a total duration of 5 years. Stratification factors were breast cancer therapy, lymph node status, hormone receptor and HER2 status, age, and geographical region. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01077154. FINDINGS: Between June 2, 2010, and Aug 24, 2012, 4509 women were randomly assigned to receive denosumab (n=2256) or placebo (n=2253) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary analysis of the study was done when all patients had the opportunity to complete 5 years of follow-up with an analysis data cutoff date of Aug 31, 2017. The primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (median not reached in either group; hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.82-1.14; p=0.70). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events, reported in patients who had at least one dose of the investigational product (2241 patients with denosumab vs 2218 patients with placebo), were neutropenia (340 [15%] vs 328 [15%]), febrile neutropenia (112 [5%] vs 142 [6%]), and leucopenia (62 [3%] vs 61 [3%]). Positively adjudicated osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 122 (5%) of 2241 patients treated with denosumab versus four (<1%) of 2218 patients treated with placebo; treatment-emergent hypocalcaemia occurred in 152 (7%) versus 82 (4%). Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the placebo group due to acute myeloid leukaemia and depressed level of consciousness. INTERPRETATION: Despite preclinical evidence suggesting RANKL inhibition might delay bone metastasis or disease recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer, in this study, denosumab did not improve disease-related outcomes for women with high-risk early breast cancer.

As the therapeutic ASNases has bacterial origin, severe side effects are associated with its use, among them hypersensitivity and inactivation of the enzyme. In this context, the objective of this work was to produce a recombinant ASNase of bacterial origin in human cells in order to determine the presence and consequences of potential post-translational modifications on the enzyme. RESULTS: Recombinant ASNase was expressed in human cells with a molecular weight of 60 kDa, larger than in Escherichia coli, which is 35 kDa. N-glycosylation analysis demonstrated that the increased molecular weight resulted from the addition of glycans to the protein by mammalian cells. The glycosylated ASNase presented in vitro activity at physiological pH and temperature. Given that glycosylation can act to reduce antigenicity by masking protein epitopes, our data may contribute to the development of an alternative ASNase in the treatment of ALL in patients who demonstrate side effects to currently marketed enzymes.",,"['Dantas, Raquel Caminha', 'Caetano, Ludmilla Freire', 'Torres, Ariany Lima Sousa', 'Alves, Matheus Soares', 'Silva, Emanuelly Thays Muniz Figueiredo', 'Teixeira, Louhanna Pinheiro Rodrigues', 'Teixeira, Daniel Camara', 'de Azevedo Moreira, Renato', 'Fonseca, Marcela Helena Gambim', 'Gaudencio Neto, Saul', 'Martins, Leonardo Tondello', 'Furtado, Gilvan Pessoa', 'Tavares, Kaio Cesar Simiano']","['Dantas RC', 'Caetano LF', 'Torres ALS', 'Alves MS', 'Silva ETMF', 'Teixeira LPR', 'Teixeira DC', 'de Azevedo Moreira R', 'Fonseca MHG', 'Gaudencio Neto S', 'Martins LT', 'Furtado GP', 'Tavares KCS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3919-161X'],"['Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Experimental Biology Center (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Brazil. kaio@unifor.br.']",['eng'],['06/2016/Edson Queiroz Foundation'],['Journal Article'],20191205,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics', 'Glycosylation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Temperature']",PMC6896745,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Glycosylation', 'Hypersensitivity', 'L-Asparaginase']",2019/12/07 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/12/07 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-019-4836-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-019-4836-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2019 Dec 5;12(1):794. doi: 10.1186/s13104-019-4836-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the principal endogenous ligand for the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and is produced by the enzymatic oxidation of dietary vitamin A, whose deficiency is associated with several pathological conditions. Differentiation therapy using ATRA revolutionized the outcome of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), although attempts to replicate these results in other cancer types have been met with more modest results. A better knowledge of RA signaling in different leukemia contexts is required to improve initial designs.

This study aimed to identify and address knowledge gaps that affect the timely referral of patients for HCT consultation. METHODS: A mixed-methods educational needs assessment included a national survey and focus groups consisting of hematologists/oncologists. An educational intervention of 3 webinars addressed identified knowledge gaps. RESULTS: A total of 150 hematologists/oncologists were recruited for the survey, of whom 20 participated in focus groups. Physicians in practice 0 to 10 years were 4.2 times more likely to refer for HCT consultation in CR1 than those with >10 years in practice (P=.0027). Physicians seeing </=10 patients with AML in the past year were 3.7 times more likely to refer for HCT consultation in CR1 than those seeing >10 patients (P=.0028). Knowledge gaps included (1) improper classification of molecular/cytogenetic results for risk stratification, (2) lack of understanding that disease stage impacts outcomes, and (3) use of chronologic age alone for referral decision-making. Combined attendance for the webinars was 1,098 clinicians; >74% of participants indicated that they would apply the knowledge they gained in clinical practice. Trends were observed toward improvement in identifying favorable-risk AML, from 48% to 60% (n=85; P=.12); improvement in identifying 2 poor-risk cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities, with the percentage of respondents indicating chromosome 7 deletion increasing from 51% to 70% (n=53; P=.05) and that of respondents indicating TP53 mutation increasing from 42% to 62% (n=62; P=.03); and improvement in identifying which patients with AML aged >60 years were most likely to benefit from HCT based on cytogenetic/molecular features, with the percentage of correct responses increasing from 66% to 81% (n=62; P=.07). CONCLUSIONS: The webinars met the educational needs of learners and improved knowledge gaps. This study provided novel insights into the learning needs of clinicians who care for patients with AML and a roadmap for future educational interventions.",,"['Meyer, Christa', 'Mau, Lih-Wen', 'Murphy, Elizabeth A', 'Denzen, Ellen M', 'Hayes, Ellyce', 'Haven, Darlene', 'Moore, Heather', 'Foster, Jackie', 'Preussler, Jaime M', 'Burns, Linda J']","['Meyer C', 'Mau LW', 'Murphy EA', 'Denzen EM', 'Hayes E', 'Haven D', 'Moore H', 'Foster J', 'Preussler JM', 'Burns LJ']",,"['aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'aNational Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, and.', 'bCenter for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Competence', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel/*education', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', '*Needs Assessment', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards"", 'Referral and Consultation/*standards']",,,,,2019/12/06 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.6004/jnccn.2019.7327 [doi]', 'jnccn18310 [pii]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2019 Dec;17(12):1473-1481. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2019.7327.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These may include induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (autoHCT) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT). However, it is not always clear how to best deliver these therapies, in terms of determining treatment eligibility, as well as adjusting or adding supportive measures to the treatment plan to maximize successful outcomes. Beyond performance status and presence of comorbidities, comprehensive geriatric assessment and individual geriatric metrics have increasingly been used to prognosticate in these settings and may offer the best approach to personalizing therapy. In the setting of AML induction, evidence supports the use of measures of physical function as independent predictors of survival. For patients undergoing alloHCT, functional status, as measured by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and gait speed, may be an important pretransplant assessment. IADL has also been associated with post-autoHCT morbidity and mortality. Current best practice includes assessment of relevant geriatric metrics prior to intensive therapy, and work is ongoing to develop complementary interventions.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Olin, Rebecca L']",['Olin RL'],,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Aged', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', '*Critical Care', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', '*Precision Medicine']",,,,,2019/12/06 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)73160-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001300 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Dec 5;134(23):2013-2021. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its therapeutic potential, targeting NF-kappaB using pharmacologic inhibitors has proven challenging. Here, we describe a myeloid cell-selective NF-kappaB inhibitor using an miR-146a mimic oligonucleotide conjugated to a scavenger receptor/Toll-like receptor 9 agonist (C-miR146a). Unlike an unconjugated miR146a, C-miR146a was rapidly internalized and delivered to the cytoplasm of target myeloid cells and leukemic cells. C-miR146a reduced expression of classic miR-146a targets (IRAK1 and TRAF6), thereby blocking activation of NF-kappaB in target cells. IV injections of C-miR146a mimic to miR-146a-deficient mice prevented excessive NF-kappaB activation in myeloid cells, and thus alleviated myeloproliferation and mice hypersensitivity to bacterial challenge. Importantly, C-miR146a showed efficacy in dampening severe inflammation in clinically relevant models of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced cytokine release syndrome. Systemic administration of C-miR146a oligonucleotide alleviated human monocyte-dependent release of IL-1 and IL-6 in a xenotransplanted B-cell lymphoma model without affecting CD19-specific CAR T-cell antitumor activity. Beyond anti-inflammatory functions, miR-146a is a known tumor suppressor commonly deleted or expressed at reduced levels in human myeloid leukemia. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas acute myeloid leukemia data set, we found an inverse correlation of miR-146a levels with NF-kappaB-related genes and with patient survival. Correspondingly, C-miR146a induced cytotoxic effects in human MDSL, HL-60, and MV4-11 leukemia cells in vitro. The repeated IV administration of C-miR146a inhibited expression of NF-kappaB target genes and thereby thwarted progression of disseminated HL-60 leukemia. Our results show the potential of using myeloid cell-targeted miR-146a mimics for the treatment of inflammatory and myeloproliferative disorders.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Su, Yu-Lin', 'Wang, Xiuli', 'Mann, Mati', 'Adamus, Tomasz P', 'Wang, Dongfang', 'Moreira, Dayson F', 'Zhang, Zhuoran', 'Ouyang, Ching', 'He, Xin', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Swiderski, Piotr M', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Baltimore, David', 'Li, Ling', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Boldin, Mark P', 'Kortylewski, Marcin']","['Su YL', 'Wang X', 'Mann M', 'Adamus TP', 'Wang D', 'Moreira DF', 'Zhang Z', 'Ouyang C', 'He X', 'Zhang B', 'Swiderski PM', 'Forman SJ', 'Baltimore D', 'Li L', 'Marcucci G', 'Boldin MP', 'Kortylewski M']",,"['Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Center for Informatics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Leukemia Center at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Leukemia Center at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; and.', 'DNA/RNA Synthesis Core Laboratory.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Leukemia Center at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Leukemia Center at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, and.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Center for Gene Therapy, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI125615/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn146 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6966933,,,,2019/12/06 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62299-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002045 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jan 16;135(3):167-180. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002045.,,,['Blood. 2020 Jan 16;135(3):155-156.

We performed a prospective study on allogeneic transplantation from a related or unrelated donor for adult patients with AA. We assessed whether reduced-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) could decrease toxicity while maintaining engraftment, and low-dose thymoglobulin could safely prevent graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). The pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 120 mg/m(2) , CY 100 mg/kg, and thymoglobulin 2.5 mg/kg with or without 2 Gy of total body irradiation. Twenty-seven patients with a median age of 36 years were analyzed. Sixteen patients received graft from related donors. The stem cell source was bone marrow in 26 patients. All of the patients but one, who died early, achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 19 days. Mixed chimerism was observed in six and five patients at days 30 and 90, respectively. Only one patient experienced secondary engraftment failure with complete donor-type chimerism. None of the patients developed severe acute GVHD. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 37.7% at 1 year. The overall survival rate was 96.3% at 1 year and 3 years. A high EB virus-DNA load was detected in one patient at days 60. No one developed EBV-lymphoproliferative disorder within a year. The results suggest that the conditioning regimen in this study was safe and effective. However, relatively high incidence of chronic GVHD needs further improvement.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kako, Shinichi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Aotsuka, Nobuyuki', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Kobayashi, Takeshi', 'Kato, Jun', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Shono, Katsuhiro', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Tsukamoto, Shokichi', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Yamazaki, Etsuko', 'Najima, Yuho', 'Hangaishi, Akira', 'Hoshino, Takumi', 'Watanabe, Reiko', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro']","['Kako S', 'Kanda Y', 'Onizuka M', 'Aotsuka N', 'Usuki K', 'Tachibana T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Kato J', 'Yano S', 'Shimizu H', 'Shono K', 'Tanaka M', 'Tsukamoto S', 'Mori T', 'Yamazaki E', 'Najima Y', 'Hangaishi A', 'Hoshino T', 'Watanabe R', 'Matsumoto K', 'Okamoto S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2635-3395', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7780-4459', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8176-4760']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Society Narita Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20191219,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Anemia, Aplastic/mortality/therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,,,2019/12/06 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25693 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Mar;95(3):251-257. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25693.

In the absence of targetable genetic mutations, there is minimal guidance on optimal treatment selection particularly in the R/R setting highlighting an unmet need for clinically useful functional biomarkers. Blood and bone marrow samples from patients treated on two clinical trials were used to test the combination of lenalidomide (LEN) and MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) chemotherapy in R/R AML patients. The bone marrow samples were available to test the clinical utility of the mitochondrial apoptotic BH3 and dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP) assays in predicting response, as there was no clear genetic biomarker identifying responders. To test whether LEN-induced mitochondrial priming predicted clinical response to LEN-MEC therapy, we performed DBP on patient myeloblasts. We found that short-term ex vivo treatment with lenalidomide discriminated clinical responders from non-responders based on drug-induced change in priming (delta priming). Using paired patient samples collected before and after clinical LEN treatment (prior to MEC dosing), we confirmed LEN-induced increased apoptotic priming in vivo, suggesting LEN enhanced vulnerability of myeloblasts to cytotoxic MEC chemotherapy. This is the first study demonstrating the potential role of DBP in predicting clinical response to a combination regimen. Our findings demonstrate that functional properties of relapsed AML can identify active therapies.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Garcia, Jacqueline S', 'Bhatt, Shruti', 'Fell, Geoffrey', 'Sperling, Adam S', 'Burgess, Michael', 'Keshishian, Hasmik', 'Yilma, Binyam', 'Brunner, Andrew', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Carr, Steven A', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Ballen, Karen', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Garcia JS', 'Bhatt S', 'Fell G', 'Sperling AS', 'Burgess M', 'Keshishian H', 'Yilma B', 'Brunner A', 'Neuberg D', 'Carr SA', 'Ebert BL', 'Ballen K', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Medeiros BC', 'Letai A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2118-6302', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6972-8137']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Conquer Cancer Foundation/International', 'Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Clearance of peripheral blood blasts (PBB) may serve as an early measure of chemosensitivity. PBB rate of clearance (PBB-RC) was calculated for treatment-naive AML patients (n = 164) undergoing induction with an anthracycline and cytarabine (7+3) and with detectable PBB at diagnosis. PBB-RC was defined as the percentage of the absolute PBB count on the day of diagnosis that was cleared with each day of therapy, on average, until D14 or day of PBB clearance. Each 5% increase in PBB-RC approximately doubled the likelihood of D14BM clearance (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.24-2.64, P < 0.005). PBB-RC was also associated with improved CR rates (OR per 5% = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.27-3.01, P < 0.005) and overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) per 5% = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52-0.87]. African American patients had poorer OS adjusted for PBB-RC (HR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.13-4.23), while race was not associated with D14BM or CR rate.

Objectives: To determine the risks for mortality in patients with cSCC and immunosuppression compared with nonimmunosuppression and to compare the difference in mortality risk based on the cause of immunocompromise. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study of patients with cSCC of the head and neck recruited participants from a tertiary cancer care center. Patients who underwent no treatment, wide local excision, or biopsy of the lesions were eligible for inclusion from January 1, 1995, to September 30, 2015. Data were analyzed from March 21, 2018, to April 4, 2019. Exposures: Immunocompromise, defined as having solid organ transplant, stem cell transplant, hematopoetic malignant disease, autoimmune disease requiring treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, type 1 or 2 diabetes treated with insulin, HIV or AIDS, or other hematoproliferative disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their immune status (immunosuppression vs no immunosuppression). The primary outcome measure was disease-specific survival. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the association of immune status with disease outcome. Results: A total of 796 patients (680 men [85.4%]; median age, 69 [range, 27-98] years), including 147 with and 649 without immunosuppression (IS and non-IS groups, respectively), constituted the final cohort. In the IS group, 77 (52.4%) had diabetes, 39 (26.5%) had lymphoma or leukemia, 25 (17.0%) had an organ or stem cell transplant, and 3 (2.0%) had HIV.

The current model suggests that infection triggers B-ALL development through induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; also known as AICDA) in precursor B-cells. This evidence has been largely acquired through the use of ex vivo functional studies. However, whether this mechanism governs native non-transplant B-ALL development is unknown. Here we show that, surprisingly, AID genetic deletion does not affect B-ALL development in Pax5-haploinsufficient mice prone to B-ALL upon natural infection exposure. We next test the effect of premature AID expression from earliest pro-B-cell stages in B-cell transformation. The generation of AID off-target mutagenic activity in precursor B-cells does not promote B-ALL. Likewise, known drivers of human B-ALL are not preferentially targeted by AID. Overall these results suggest that infections promote B-ALL through AID-independent mechanisms, providing evidence for a new model of childhood B-ALL development.",,"['Rodriguez-Hernandez, Guillermo',

Here we report the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the NCP-bound human MLL1 core complex. We show that the MLL1 core complex anchors to the NCP via the conserved RbBP5 and ASH2L, which interact extensively with nucleosomal DNA and the surface close to the N-terminal tail of histone H4. Concurrent interactions of RbBP5 and ASH2L with the NCP uniquely align the catalytic MLL1(SET) domain at the nucleosome dyad, thereby facilitating symmetrical access to both H3K4 substrates within the NCP.

Here, we investigated whether inhibition of Kv1.3 channels can also induce cellular resistance mechanisms that counteract the induction of cell death under certain conditions. METHODS: We treated leukemic T cells with the mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 inhibitor PCARBTP and determined the activity of different kinases associated with cell survival including ZAP70, PI-3-K, AKT, JNK and ERK by measuring the activation-associated phosphorylation of these proteins. Furthermore, we inhibited AKT and JNK and determined the effect of PCARBTP-induced tumor cell death. RESULTS: We demonstrate that treatment of Jurkat T leukemia cells with low doses of the mitochondria-targeted inhibitor of Kv1.3 PCARBTP (0.25 muM or 1 muM) for 10 minutes induced a constitutive phosphorylation/activation of the pro-survival signaling molecules ZAP70, PI-3-K, AKT and JNK, while the phosphorylation/activation of ERK was not affected. Stimulation of Jurkat cells via the TCR/CD3 complex induced an additional activation of a similar pattern of signaling events. Higher doses of the Kv1.3 inhibitor, i.e. 10 muM PCARBTP, reduced the basal phosphorylation/activation of these signaling molecules and also impaired their activation upon stimulation via the TCR/CD3 complex. A low dose of PCARBTP, i.e. 0.25 muM PCARBTP, was almost without any effect on cell death. In contrast, concomitant inhibition of PI-3-K or AKT greatly sensitized Jurkat leukemia cells to the Kv1.3 inhibitor PCARBTP and allowed induction of cell death already at 0.25 muM PCARBTP. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that Jurkat leukemia cells respond to low doses of the mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 inhibitor PCARBTP with an activation of survival signals counteracting cell death. Inhibition of these T cell survival signals sensitizes leukemia cells to death induced by mitochondria-targeted Kv1.3 inhibitors. High doses of the Kv1.3 inhibitor inactivate these signals directly permitting death.",['(c) Copyright by the Author(s).

Recently, a molecular classifier using the mutational status of NOTCH1, FBXW7, RAS, and PTEN (NFRP) has been shown to distinguish low- vs high-risk groups in adult T-ALL patients treated using the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster ALL protocol. However, it is unknown if this molecular classifier can stratify adult T-ALL patients treated with hyper-CVAD +/- nelarabine. We identified a relatively small cohort of 27 adults with T-ALL who were uniformly treated with hyper-CVAD +/- nelarabine with available mutational analysis at time of diagnosis. The most commonly mutated genes in this group were NOTCH1 (52%), NRAS (22%), DNMT3A (19%), KRAS (15%), and TP53 (7%). The NFRP molecular classifier failed to stratify overall survival (OS; P = .84) and relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .18) in this cohort. We developed a new stratification model combining K/NRAS and TP53 mutations as high-risk factors and showed that mutations in these genes predicted poorer OS (P = .03) and RFS (P = .04).

This material has been shared in an anonymized fashion to accelerate progress in overcoming lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death across the world. However, this cell line collection also includes a range of other cancers derived from patient-donated specimens that have been remarkably valuable for other types of cancer and disease research. A comprehensive analysis conducted by the NCI Center for Research Strategy of the 278 cell lines reported in the original Journal of Cellular Biochemistry Supplement, documents that these cell lines and related products have since been used in more than 14 000 grants, and 33 207 published scientific reports. This has resulted in over 1.2 million citations using at least one cell line. Many publications involve the use of more than one cell line, to understand the value of the resource collectively rather than individually; this method has resulted in 2.9 million citations. In addition, these cell lines have been linked to 422 clinical trials and cited by 4700 patents through publications. For lung cancer alone, the cell lines have been used in the research cited in the development of over 70 National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical guidelines. Finally, it must be underscored again, that patient altruism enabled the availability of this invaluable research resource.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The outcome of children with AML has increased remarkably over the past 30 years, with current survival rates up to 70%, mainly due to intensification of standard chemotherapy and improvements in risk classification, supportive care, and minimal residual disease monitoring. However, childhood AML prognosis remains unfavorable and relapse rates are still around 30%. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to increase the cure rate. In AML, the presence of gene mutations and rearrangements prompted the identification of effective targeted molecular strategies, including kinase inhibitors, cell pathway inhibitors, and epigenetic modulators.

It is the most potent anti-leukemic therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is routinely used with curative intent in patients with intermediate and poor risk disease. Donor T cells, and possibly other immune cells, eliminate residual leukemia cells after prior (radio)chemotherapy. This immune-mediated response is known as graft-versus-leukemia (GvL). Donor alloimmune responses can also be directed against healthy tissues, which is known as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). GvHD and GvL often co-occur and, therefore, a major barrier to exploiting the full immunotherapeutic benefit of donor immune cells against patient leukemia is the immunosuppression required to treat GvHD. However, curative responses to allo-SCT and GvHD do not always occur together, suggesting that these two immune responses could be de-coupled in some patients. To make further progress in successfully promoting GvL without GvHD, we must transform our limited understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of GvL and GvHD. Specifically, in most patients we do not understand the antigenic basis of immune responses in GvL and GvHD. Identification of antigens important for GvL but not GvHD, and vice versa, could impact on donor selection, allow us to track GvL immune responses and begin to specifically harness and strengthen anti-leukemic immune responses against patient AML cells, whilst minimizing the toxicity of GvHD.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Sweeney and Vyas.'],"['Sweeney, Connor', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Sweeney C', 'Vyas P']",,"['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['MC_UU_00016/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/L008963/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137961146/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191119,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6877747,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'antigens', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'graft-versus-leukemia', 'stem cell transplantation']",2019/12/06 06:00,2019/12/06 06:01,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01217 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Nov 19;9:1217. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01217. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, the antitumor activity of APO866 on various types of cancer models has been reported, information regarding mechanisms by which APO866 exerts its cytotoxic effects is not well defined. Here we show that APO866 induces a strong, time-dependent increase in highly reactive ROS, nitric oxide, cytosolic/mitochondrial superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide. We provide evidence that APO866-mediated ROS production is modulated by PARP1 and triggers cell death through mitochondria depolarization and ATP loss. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PARP1 prevented hydrogen peroxide accumulation, caspase activation, mitochondria depolarization, ATP loss and abrogates APO866-induced cell death, suggesting that the integrity of PARP1 status is required for cell death. Conversely, PARP1 activating drugs enhanced the anti-leukemia activity of APO866 Collectively, our studies show that APO866 induces ROS/RNS productions, which mediate its anti-leukemia effect.

Flow cytometry immunophenotyping is used for rapid and specific diagnosis but there are cases when we are not facing a typical immunophenotype, so there is a constant need to find new markers and new combinations of markers that would allow the improvement and the development of our diagnosis. Aim: Our aim was to evaluate CD 200 expression in different B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. CD200 is a membrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and the over-expression of CD200 has been reported in a number of malignancies, including CLL, as well as on cancer stem cells. Methods: We analyzed the CD200 expression in 122 patients diagnosed with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (100 patients with CLL, 10 patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 10 patients with MCL and 2 patients with hairy cell leukemia), in the Department of Hematology of the University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest. We performed immunophenotypical analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration on BD FACS Calibur flowcytometer. Results: CD200 was brightly expressed in all 100 CLL patients (100%). In SMZL patients, CD200 was dim positive (40%-60%), in patients with HCL. CD200 was also bright positive (96% and 97%) and in patients with MCL CD200 was negative (1-10%); CD 200 was significantly higher in CLL patients compared with other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. We found 14 patients with CD19, CD5 positive population and CD23- , but with high expression of CD 200. Cyclin D1 was negative on bone marrow biopsy in 13/14 of these patients. (1/14 patients were without bone marrow involvement); Conclusions: CD200 has a great impact in diagnosing B- chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, especially when we want to determine the origin of a CD19, CD5 positive population and distinguish between CLL and MCL. CD 23 is a reliable marker in those cases, but, as we showed, CD23 might have a lower specificity than CD200 for CLL. We added CD200 in our panels in order to diagnose chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, not to replace CD 23, but to improve and save time in our diagnostic process. The high expression of CD200 in CLL and HCL could open the option for new- targeted therapy (anti-CD200).",['(c)Carol Davila University Press.'],"['Iova, A', 'Vladareanu, A', 'Bumbea, H', 'Begu, M', 'Vasile, D', 'Andrus, E']","['Iova A', 'Vladareanu A', 'Bumbea H', 'Begu M', 'Vasile D', 'Andrus E']",,"['Department of Hematology, University Emergency Hospital, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest.', 'Department of Hematology, University Emergency Hospital, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest.', 'Department of Hematology, University Emergency Hospital, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest.', 'Department of Hematology, University Emergency Hospital, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest.', 'Department of Hematology, University Emergency Hospital, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest.', 'Department of Hematology, University Emergency Hospital, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Romania,J Med Life,Journal of medicine and life,101477617,,IM,,PMC6880221,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD200', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'chronic lymphoproliferative disorders', 'mantle cell lymphoma']",2012/10/01 00:00,2012/10/01 00:01,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Life. 2012 Oct-Dec;5(Spec Issue):66-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the immune system has an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases but also in the chronic lymphoproliferative malignancies. In this process of autoimmunity associated with immunodeficiency, the CLL neoplastic cells, the non-malignant B cells, T cells, and the cellular microenvironment cells are also involved. CLL pathological lymphocytes change peripheral immune tolerance acting as an antigen presenting cells and / or cells expressing inhibitory cytokines.

Cytogenetic analysis was performed by GTG banding on cultures of marrow cells treated with colcemid. Molecular analysis used RT-PCR performed on ABI 9700 platform in order to identify the following fusion genes: E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, MLL-AF4, CBFC-MYH11, BCR-ABL, SIL-TAL, and MLL-AF9as well as mutations in Flt3, NPM1, WT1 genes.

Proper diagnosis and classification of BAL are extremely important for patients' outcome since BAL usually has a poor prognosis. Purpose: The objective of this study was to identify the incidence of biphenotypic acute leukemia, their clinical characteristics and outcome of BAL patients with the chemotherapy treatment and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) after initial complete remission. Patients and methods: Ten cases of biphenotypic acute leukemia were analyzed for their clinical characteristics, immunological phenotypes, chemotherapy methods for induction initial complete remission and outcome data, including induction chemotherapy, complete remission (CR) and the overall survival time, relapse and death. This study was an observational, retrospective, and descriptive study of the clinical aspects of BAL. Cytogenetics and fusion genes analysis were also done with bone marrow samples using G-banding analysis and karyotyped according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. The fusion genes' mutational status was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Gene mutation analyses were conducted with next-generation sequencing method. Results: Among 10 BAL patients, 4 cases carried B/Myeloid phenotype, 4 cases carried T/Myeloid phenotype and 2 cases carried T/B phenotype. Cytogenetic analysis showed that 3 of the 10 cases had clonal abnormalities. Of the four cases of fusion gene aberration, two patients had RUNX1 gene mutation, one patient had BCR/ABL fusion gene mutation, and one patient had JAK1, JAK3, FBXW7 mutation. Overall, 5 of 8 (62.5%) BAL patients with chemotherapy achieved complete remission (CR) after their initial induction therapy. In the AML-directed therapy group, 1 of 2 (50%) patients achieved CR. Meanwhile, 4 of 6 (66.7%) patients achieved CR after ALL-directed induction chemotherapy. Two patients received Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) after initial CRs, one patient died two months after transplantation due to pulmonary infection, and another patient is still alive. With an average of 14.3 (4.0-42.0) months' follow-ups, the median survival time was 7 months. Although patients achieved CR after initial chemotherapy, the relapse rate was very high and the CR rate after relapse was very low. Conclusion: Our results confirmed that BAL is a rare malignancy with a very poor prognosis. Patients with ALL-directed chemotherapy achieved a better CR rate compared to those with AML-directed chemotherapy. Patients should receive HSCT after initial CR whenever it is possible.",['(c) 2019 Yu et al.'],"['Yu, Jifeng', 'Li, Yingmei', 'Xing, Haizhou', 'Pan, Yue', 'Sun, Hui', 'Wan, Dingming', 'Liu, Yanfang', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Wang, Chong', 'Sun, Ling', 'Sun, Kai', 'Jiang, Zhongxing']","['Yu J', 'Li Y', 'Xing H', 'Pan Y', 'Sun H', 'Wan D', 'Liu Y', 'Xie X', 'Wang C', 'Sun L', 'Sun K', 'Jiang Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1217-4385', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6882-117X']","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Henan Province, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191031,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6827437,,['NOTNLM'],"['BAL', 'MPAL', 'biphenotypic acute leukemia', 'clinical outcome', 'immunophenotyping', 'mixed-phenotype acute leukemia']",2019/12/06 06:00,2019/12/06 06:01,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S226058 [doi]', '226058 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Oct 31;11:9297-9306. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S226058. eCollection 2019.,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Searching for coexpressed lncRNA clusters or representative biomarkers related to malignant phenotypes of GC may help to elucidate the mechanism of tumor development and predict the prognosis of GC. AIM: To investigate the prognostic value of NOTCH1 associated with lncRNA in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (NALT1) in GC and the mechanism of its involvement in GC invasion and metastasis. METHODS: RNA sequencing and corresponding clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The significance module was studied by weighted gene coexpression network analysis. A total of 336 clinical samples were included in the study. Gene silencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, scrape motility assay, and Transwell migration assay were used to assess the function of hub-lncRNAs. RESULTS: At the transcriptome level, 3339 differentially expressed lncRNAs were obtained. weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to obtain 15 lncRNA clusters and observe their coexpression. Pearson's correlation showed that blue module was correlated with tumor grade and survival. NALT1 was the hub-lncRNA of blue module and was an independent risk factor for GC prognosis. NALT1 was overexpressed in GC and its expression was closely related to invasion and metastasis. The mechanism may involve NALT1 regulation of NOTCH1, which is associated with lncRNA in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, through cis regulation, thereby affecting the expression of the NOTCH signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: NALT1 is overexpressed and promotes invasion and metastasis of GC. The mechanism may be related to regulation of NOTCH1 by NALT1 and its effect on NOTCH signaling pathway expression.","['(c)The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The compound was synthesized under microwave irradiation. The single-crystal X-ray structure analysis revealed an angle of 13.36 (8) degrees between the planes of the rings, as well as molecules linked by Nsp(2)-H...N hydrogen bonds forming dimers along the crystal. The material was analyzed by FT-IR vibrational spectroscopy, while a computational approach was used to elucidate the vibrational frequency couplings. The existence of Nsp(2)-H...N hydrogen bonds in the crystal was confirmed spectroscopically by the IR peaks from the N-H stretching vibration shifting to lower wavenumbers in the solid state relative to those in the gas phase. The supramolecular studies confirmed the formation of centrosymmetric R2(2)(8) rings, which correspond to the formation of dimers that stack parallel to the b direction. Other weak C-H...pi interactions, essential for crystal growth, were found. The UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis showed a donor-acceptor process, where the amino group acts as a donor and the pyridine and pyrimidine rings act as acceptors. The reactive sites of the molecule were identified and their quantitative values were defined using the electrostatic potential model proposed in the multifunctional wave function analyzer multiwfn. The calculated interaction energies between pairs of molecules were used to visualize the electrostatic terms as the leading factors against the dispersion factors in the crystal-growth process. The docking results showed that the amino group of the pyrimidine moiety was simultaneously anchored by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the Asp427 and His407 protein residues.

We aimed to (1) identify an early time point that is predictive of future neuropathy using a patient-reported outcome and (2) propose a dose-adjustment algorithm based on simulated data to manage neuropathy. In previous work, a dose-neuropathy model was developed using dosing and patient-reported outcome data from Cancer and Leukemia Group B 40502 (Alliance), a randomized phase III trial of paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel or ixabepilone as first-line chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. In the current work, an early time point that is predictive of the future severity of neuropathy was identified based on predictive accuracy of the model. Using the early data and model parameters, simulations were conducted to propose a dose-adjustment algorithm for the prospective management of neuropathy in individual patients. The end of the first 3 cycles (12 weeks) was identified as the early time point based on a predictive accuracy of 75% for the neuropathy score after 6 cycles. For paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, and ixabepilone, simulations with the proposed dose-adjustment algorithm resulted in 61%, 48%, and 35% fewer patients, respectively, with neuropathy score >/=8 after 6 cycles compared to no dose adjustment. We conclude that early patient-reported outcome data on neuropathy can be used to guide dose adjustments in individual patients that reduce the severity of future neuropathy. Prospective validation of this approach should be undertaken in future studies.","['(c) 2019, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']","['Sharma, Manish R', 'Mehrotra, Shailly', 'Gray, Elizabeth', 'Wu, Kehua', 'Barry, William T', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Lyss, Alan P', 'Toppmeyer, Deborah L', 'Moreno-Aspitia, Alvaro', 'Lad, Thomas E', 'Velasco, Mario', 'Overmoyer, Beth', 'Rugo, Hope S', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Gobburu, Jogarao V']","['Sharma MR', 'Mehrotra S', 'Gray E', 'Wu K', 'Barry WT', 'Hudis C', 'Winer EP', 'Lyss AP', 'Toppmeyer DL', 'Moreno-Aspitia A', 'Lad TE', 'Velasco M', 'Overmoyer B', 'Rugo HS', 'Ratain MJ', 'Gobburu JV']",,"['The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare/Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Heartland Cancer Research NCORP, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.', 'John H.

Cancers such as childhood leukemia are characterized by their capacity to infiltrate different organs. MMP production by leukemic cells may indicate a leukemic subtype or subpopulation with a more invasive phenotype. Therefore, clarifying the action mechanisms of MMPs as prognostic predictors or MMP targeting as a therapeutic strategy is necessary. MMP-targeting drugs have been developed for the treatment of hematological malignancies. In this review, we highlight current advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms and pathological characteristics of various MMPs, as well as recent therapeutic advances targeting MMPs in childhood leukemia. Several studies have been conducted on the therapeutic efficacy of MMP inhibitors in cancer, such as collagen peptidomimetics, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of MMP active sites, bisphosphonates, and tetracycline derivatives. Here, we conclude that more clinical trials are necessary to estimate the role of selective MMP inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of childhood leukemia.",,"['Hsiao, Yi-Hsuan', 'Su, Shih-Chi', 'Lin, Chiao-Wen', 'Chao, Yu-Hua', 'Yang, Wei-En', 'Yang, Shun-Fa']","['Hsiao YH', 'Su SC', 'Lin CW', 'Chao YH', 'Yang WE', 'Yang SF']",,"['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, 110 Chien-Kuo N.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 2664 hospitalized cancer patients that analyzed the main dental treatment needs and dental procedures performed from January 2010 to December 2017. RESULTS: A total of 2664 medical patients were included in this study. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17.2%) was the most common cancer type, followed by leukemia (14.8%), and oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (10.5%). The most common reasons for patients' hospitalization were chemotherapy protocols (18.8%), monitoring head and neck surgeries (9.7%), and febrile neutropenia (9.6%). The main motivation for the medical team to request dental evaluation was oral mucositis (22.8%) followed by oral pain or toothache (10.8%) and fungal, viral oral infections or traumatic oral lesions (9.9%). The dental treatment needs most observed were pain due to oral mucositis (17%), dental treatment prior to radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT) or bisphosphonate therapy (BP) (10.8%), teeth extractions (6.5%), and prophylactic photobiomodulation therapy (6.3%), whereas the most common dental treatments performed were oral hygiene protocols (30.2%), photobiomodulation therapy (prophylactic and curative) (21.7%), and dental treatment prior to cancer treatment initiation (RT, CT, and BP) (9.5%).

Ibrutinib, an FDA approved, orally administered BTK inhibitor, has demonstrated high response rates, however, complete responses are infrequent and acquired resistance to BTK inhibition can emerge. In this study, we generated ibrutinib-resistant (IB-R) cell lines by chronic exposure of CLL and activated B-cell (ABC)-DLBCL cells to ibrutinib in order to investigate the mechanism of acquired resistance to ibrutinib. IB-R cell lines demonstrated downregulation of FOXO3a and PTEN levels and activation of AKT, with their levels being low in the nuclei of resistant cells in comparison to the sensitive counterparts. Inhibition of PI3K and AKT using idelalisib and MK2206, respectively increased ibrutinib-induced apoptosis in IB-R cells by downregulation of pAKT(473) and restoring FOXO3a levels, demonstrating the importance of these cell survival factors for ibrutinib-resistance. Notably, the exportin 1 inhibitor, selinexor synergized with ibrutinib in IB-R cells and restored nuclear abundance of FOXO3a and PTEN, suggesting that nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a and PTEN facilitates increase in ibrutinib-induced apoptosis in IB-R cells. These data demonstrate that reactivation of FOXO3a nuclear function enhances the efficacy of ibrutinib and overcomes acquired resistance to ibrutinib. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that confers ibrutinib resistance via aberrant nuclear/cytoplasmic subcellular localization of FOXO3a and could be exploited by rational therapeutic combination regimens for effectively treating lymphoid malignancies.",,"['Kapoor, Isha', 'Li, Yue', 'Sharma, Arishya', 'Zhu, Huayuan', 'Bodo, Juraj', 'Xu, Wei', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Almasan, Alexandru']","['Kapoor I', 'Li Y', 'Sharma A', 'Zhu H', 'Bodo J', 'Xu W', 'Hsi ED', 'Hill BT', 'Almasan A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8916-6650'],"['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA. almasaa@ccf.org.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA. almasaa@ccf.org.', 'Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA. almasaa@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA184137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA184137/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Cancer', 'Institute (NCI)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191204,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC6892912,,,,2019/12/06 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-2158-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-2158-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Dec 4;10(12):924. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-2158-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identified 585 unique S-nitrosylation sites among 434 proteins in PDAC patients and PANC-1 cell line by a site-specific proteomics. Larger number of S-nitrosylated proteins were identified in PDAC tissues and PANC-1 cells than adjacent non-cancerous tissues. These S-nitrosylated proteins are significantly enriched in a multitude of biological processes associated with tumorigenesis, including carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeleton regulation, cell cycle, focal adhesion, adherent junctions, and cell migration. Components of the pancreatic cancer pathway were extensively S-nitrosylated, such as v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Moreover, NOS (NO synthase) inhibitor significantly repressed STAT3 S-nitrosylation in PANC-1 cells, which caused significant increase of STAT3 phosphorylation and PANC-1 cell viability, suggesting important roles of protein S-nitrosylation in PDAC development.

B-cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) homology domain 3 (BH3)-mimetics are emerging as a novel class of apoptosis-inducing agents that are currently being tested for the treatment of different hematological malignancies including AML. Particularly, the selective BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199/Venetoclax is demonstrating clinical responses and has recently been approved in combination for the treatment of AML. Compounds targeting the related protein MCL-1 have recently entered clinical trials, highlighting the urgency to compare the different BH3-mimetics and identify the most promising antiapoptotic target in AML. We performed a side-by-side comparison of different highly selective and potent BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-2 (ABT-199), MCL-1 (S63845) or BCL-xL (A1331852) in a panel of AML cell lines and primary patient cells. Gene knockdown using siRNAs was utilized to investigate the functional relevance of BCL-2 proteins. Western blotting and immunoprecipitations were used to explore the influence of BH3-mimetics on interactions between pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. A1331852 induced apoptosis only in selected cases, indicating that BCL-xL is not a very promising therapeutic target in AML. However, S63845 displayed higher potency than ABT-199, with more cell lines and primary cells responding to S63845 than to ABT-199. MCL-1 dependency in AML cells was confirmed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of MCL-1, which was sufficient to induce apoptosis. S63845-induced cell death was accompanied by a displacement of the BH3-only protein BIM as well as BAK, resulting in BAK-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, ABT-199-induced cell death was mediated by BAX rather than BAK, indicating distinct non-redundant molecular functions of BCL-2 and MCL-1 in AML. Our study reveals that MCL-1 may be a more prevalent therapeutic target than BCL-2 in AML and identifies BIM and BAK as important mediators of S63845-induced apoptosis in AML.",,"['Ewald, Larissa', 'Dittmann, Jessica', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Ewald L', 'Dittmann J', 'Vogler M', 'Fulda S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0459-6417'],"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191204,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6892884,,,,2019/12/06 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-2156-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-2156-2 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Dec 4;10(12):917. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-2156-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE2Z cells were transfected with miR- 205-5p-mimic or miR-205-5p-inhibitor, treated with 80 mumol/L 3-bromopyruvate alone, or exposed to both of the treatments. The proliferation of the treated cells was examined with MTT assay, and early apoptosis of the cells was detected using a mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit (JC-1). DAPI fluorescence staining was used to detect morphological changes of the cell nuclei and late cell apoptosis; Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was employed to detect the cell apoptosis rate. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, Mcl-1 and Bak proteins. RESULTS: Exposure to 3-bromopyruvate significantly inhibited the proliferation of CNE2Z cells, and increasing the drug concentration and extending the treatment time produced stronger inhibitory effects. Treatment with 80 mumol/L 3-bromopyruvate for 24, 48 and 72 h resulted in inhibition rates of (45.7+/-1.21)%, (64.4+/-2.02)% and (78.3+/-1.55)% in non-transfected CNE2Z cells, respectively; the inhibition rates were (27.7+/-1.04)%, (34.8+/-2.10)% and (44.3+/-1.57)% in the cells transfected with miR-205-5p-mimic, and were (80.5 +/- 0.94)%, (87.9 +/- 0.50)% and (93.8 +/- 1.16)% in cells transfected with miR-205-5p-inhibitor, respectively. The results of mitochondrial membrane potential detection showed that the relative proportion of red and green fluorescence decreased significantly in miR-205-5p-inhibitor-transfected cells with 3-bromopyruvate treatment. Combined treatment of the cells with 3-bromopyruvate and miR-205-5p-inhibitor transfection obviously increased nuclear fragmentation and nuclear pyknosis and significantly increased cell apoptotic rate as compared with the two treatments alone (P < 0.01), causing also decreased expressions of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins and increased expressions of Bax and Bak proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of miR-205-5p enhances the proapototic effect of 3-bromopyruvate in CNE2Z cells possibly in relation to the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and the up-regulation of Bak and Bax proteins.",,"['Shi, Zongfen', 'Zhang, Pei', 'Lu, Xingyue', 'Zhu, Chenlu', 'Chen, Changjiang', 'Zhao, Surong', 'Liu, Hao']","['Shi Z', 'Zhang P', 'Lu X', 'Zhu C', 'Chen C', 'Zhao S', 'Liu H']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Bengbu Medical College/Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Biochemical Pharmaceuticals, Bengbu 233030, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN205 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyruvates)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '63JMV04GRK (bromopyruvate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyruvates/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6867955,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-bromopyruvate', 'apoptosis', 'miR-205-5p', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma']",2019/12/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2019.10.06 [doi]'],ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2019 Oct 30;39(10):1166-1172. doi: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2019.10.06.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-asparaginase (ASNase) is one of the main drugs used and causes death of leukemic cells by systematically depleting the non-essential amino acid asparagine. Three main types of ASNase have been used so far: native ASNase derived from Escherichia coli, an enzyme isolated from Erwinia chrysanthemi and a pegylated form of the native E. coli ASNase, the ASNase PEG. Hypersensitivity reactions are the main complication related to this drug. Although clinical allergies may be important, a major concern is that antibodies produced in response to ASNase may cause rapid inactivation of ASNase, leading to a worse prognosis. This reaction is commonly referred to as ""silent hypersensitivity"" or ""silent inactivation"". We are able to analyze hypersensitivity and inactivation processes by the measurement of the ASNase activity. The ability to individualize the ASNase therapy in patients, adjusting the dose or switching patients with silent inactivation to an alternate ASNase preparation may help improve outcomes in those patients. This review article aims to describe the pathophysiology of the inactivation process, how to diagnose it and finally how to manage it.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

The aim of this study was to explore the underlying molecule mechanisms of miR-100 involved in AML. The expressions of miR-100 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in pediatric AML patients and cell lines were monitored using qRT-PCR and western blot assays. MTT assay was carried to evaluate cell viability. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The binding sites between miR-100 and ATM were predicted by mirtarbase database. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the relationship between miR-100 and ATM. miR-100 expression was highly expressed in bone marrow of AML patients and cell lines. Moreover, Knockdown of miR-100 led to the inhibition of viability and promotion of apoptosis in Kasumi-1 and MV-4-11 cells. miR-100 harbored the 3'UTR of ATM. Meanwhile, the expression of ATM was downregulated in bone marrow of AML patients and AML cell lines. Subsequently, a negative correlation between miR-100 and ATM in bone marrow of AML patients was also observed. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ATM repressed cell viability while enhanced apoptosis. Notably, loss of ATM attenuated the effect of miR-100 depletion on cell viability and apoptosis in AML cells. miR-100 participates in cell viability and apoptosis by targeting ATM in pediatric AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which is characterized by an indolent course, with relative refractoriness to conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapy, and occasionally referred for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has gained attention in the treatment of both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and hematological malignancies. However, many patients with hematological malignancies eventually undergo allo-HCT, raising the concern of potential adverse events (graft versus host disease) due to manipulation of the immune system with use of checkpoint inhibitors. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient with relapsed refractory CTCL (Sezary Syndrome) who underwent allo-HCT with persistence of disease post-transplant. The patient additionally developed a progressively worsening lesion on the right shoulder which was biopsied and showed poorly differentiated carcinoma (cSCC). Pembrolizumab was started for the treatment of cSCC. After second cycle of treatment, the cSCC lesion responded dramatically to the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor. Also, the patient experienced significant resolution of pruritus and generalized erythema. During 24 months of follow up after initial treatment with checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy, the patient showed durable response of both cSCC and CTCL, as well as restoration of full donor chimerism, without obvious worsening of graft versus host disease (GVHD). CONCLUSION: This is the first case to our knowledge of rapid and durable response of both cSCC and CTCL to immune checkpoint inhibition after allo-HCT. Although this report highlights the potential for significant response to this class of medication, further studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of this approach in patients with CTCL after allo-HCT given the potential concern of GVHD.",,"['Khaddour, Karam', 'Musiek, Amy', 'Cornelius, Lynn A', 'Dehdashti, Farrokh', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Fields, Ryan', 'Ansstas, George']","['Khaddour K', 'Musiek A', 'Cornelius LA', 'Dehdashti F', 'Westervelt P', 'Fields R', 'Ansstas G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6697-3516'],"['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in Saint Louis, 660 South Euclid Avenue, Campus Box 8056, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University in Saint Louis, St. Louis, USA.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in Saint Louis, St. Louis, USA.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in Saint Louis, St. Louis, USA.', 'Alvin J.

Although studies focus mainly on the contribution of BCL-2, here we also investigate the contribution of other anti-apoptotic proteins to CHOP-therapy resistance in DLBCL. Functional dynamic BCL-2 homology (BH)3 profiling was applied to DLBCL cell lines upon CHOP treatment or single CHOP compounds. Cell-specific anti-apoptotic dependencies were validated with corresponding BH3-mimetics. We found high expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-XL in DLBCL cell lines and patients. CHOP treatment resulted in both enhanced and altered anti-apoptotic dependency. Enhanced sensitivity to different BH3-mimetics after CHOP treatment was confirmed in specific cell lines, indicating heterogeneity of CHOP-induced resistance in DLBCL. Analysis of single CHOP compounds demonstrated that similar changes could also be induced by doxorubicin or vincristine, providing evidence for clinical combination therapies of doxorubicin or vincristine with BH3-mimetics in DLBCL. In conclusion, we show for the first time that CHOP treatment induces increased anti-apoptotic dependency on MCL-1 and BCL-XL, and not just BCL-2. These results provide new perspectives for the treatment of CHOP-resistant DLBCL and underline the potential of BH3 profiling in predicting therapy outcomes.",,"['de Jong, Mathilde Rikje Willemijn', 'Langendonk, Myra', 'Reitsma, Bart', 'Nijland, Marcel', 'van den Berg, Anke', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Visser, Lydia', 'van Meerten, Tom']","['de Jong MRW', 'Langendonk M', 'Reitsma B', 'Nijland M', 'van den Berg A', 'Ammatuna E', 'Visser L', 'van Meerten T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2740-2873', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8894-2638', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5581-6950']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['RUG 2014-6727/KWF Kankerbestrijding', 'Mandema Stipendium/KWF Kankerbestrijding']",['Journal Article'],20191130,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6928684,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'BCL-XL', 'CHOP', 'MCL-1', 'S63845', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'venetoclax']",2019/12/06 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/12/06 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20236036 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20236036 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Nov 30;20(23). pii: ijms20236036. doi: 10.3390/ijms20236036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present diffTF (https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF) to calculate differential TF activity (basic mode) and classify TFs into putative transcriptional activators or repressors (classification mode). In basic mode, it combines genome-wide chromatin accessibility/activity with putative TF binding sites that, in classification mode, are integrated with RNA-seq. We apply diffTF to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types. In both datasets, diffTF recovers most known biology and finds many previously unreported TFs. It classifies almost 40% of TFs based on their mode of action, which we validate experimentally. Overall, we demonstrate that diffTF recovers known biology, identifies less well-characterized TFs, and classifies TFs into transcriptional activators or repressors.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Therapeutic targeting of cancer metabolism relies on defining limiting requirements and vulnerabilities in the highly dynamic metabolic network. Here, we characterize the metabolic reprogramming and identify cancer-specific metabolic vulnerabilities in response to the pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. Our work reveals the adaptation mechanism in malignant lymphocytes providing resistance against the biguanides phenformin and metformin by transcriptionally reprogramming glucose metabolism. Metabolic adaptation to complex I inhibition is mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) serving as a mitochondrial stress signal activating hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). Inhibition of the mROS/HIF-1a axis through antioxidants or direct suppression of HIF-1a selectively disrupts metabolic adaptation and survival during complex I dysfunction in malignant lymphocytes.

A large body of literature explores why this population experiences lower rates of trial enrollment, an issue of particular importance since this single factor is thought to have the greatest impact on the decrease in survivorship. The purpose of this research is primarily to identify whether or not AYA patients within a large academic center who were treated by a pediatric specialist were more likely to be enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by chart review of AYA cancer patients within a large academic institution diagnosed from 2014 to 2016. Information, including physician specialty, sex, cancer subtype, age, and ethnicity were extracted and analyzed in relation to enrollment data from the clinical trials office. Results: Patients managed by a pediatric specialist were over 10 times more likely (p < 0.01) than those treated by adult specialists to be enrolled in a clinical trial. When stratified by cancer subtype, pediatric specialist management still predicted trial enrollment in subtypes more common in younger patients, including germ cell and osseous neoplasms, leukemia, and lymphoma. Neither age, sex, nor ethnicity correlated significantly with enrollment. Conclusion: These data not only depict the necessity of abandoning traditional age cutoffs when dealing with AYA cancer, but also reveal the need for further study to understand and ultimately rectify the discrepancy between pediatric and adult utilization of clinical trial enrollment.",,"['Marshall, Callie S', 'Grimes, Allison']","['Marshall CS', 'Grimes A']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The University of Texas Health at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The University of Texas Health at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191203,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Physicians/*standards', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical trial', '*demographics', '*pediatric', '*physician', '*specialty']",2019/12/05 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2019/12/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2019.0125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2020 Apr;9(2):183-189. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2019.0125.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched relevant articles from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane by 1st December, 2018. This meta-analysis included 20 case-control studies, involving 7,538 AML patients and 137,924 healthy controls. Studies reported OR and 95%CI of the correlation between cigarette smoking and AML susceptibility were eligible. Subsequently, the included data were weighted by an inverse variance and analyzed using fixed-effects or random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on ethnicities and sources of controls. Heterogeneity test was applied for the included articles. Data analyses were conducted using STATA 12.0. RESULTS: Current smokers (OR=1.42, 95%CI= 1.28-1.57; p=0.392) and ever-smokers (OR=1.16, 95%CI=1.05-1.28; p=0.036) were associated with AML susceptibility. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, only current smokers (OR=1.45, 95%CI=1.29-1.63; p=0.371) and ever-smokers (OR=1.16, 95%CI=1.03-1.30; p=0.034) of the Caucasian population were associated with AML susceptibility. Stratified analysis based on SOC (source of controls) indicated increased susceptibility of AML in current smokers (OR=1.43, 95%CI=1.26-1.63; p=0.283) and ever-smokers (OR=1.20, 95%CI=1.07-1.35; p=0.078) of the population-based group. Nevertheless, only current smokers in the hospital-based group had increased susceptibility of AML (OR=1.45, 95%CI=1.19-1.76; p=0.198). The risks of AML in ever-smokers (OR=1.04, 95%CI = 0.81-1.35; p=0.054) of the hospital-based group did not remarkably changed.

In addition to deacetylating histones and other proteins, SIRT1/2-mediated regulation is coupled with other epigenetic enzymes. Here, we investigate the links between SIRT1/2 activity and DNA methylation in macrophage differentiation due to their relevance in myeloid cells. SIRT1/2 display drastic upregulation during macrophage differentiation and their inhibition impacts the expression of many inflammation-related genes. In this context, SIRT1/2 inhibition abrogates DNA methylation gains, but does not affect demethylation. Inhibition of hypermethylation occurs at many inflammatory loci, which results in more drastic upregulation of their expression upon macrophage polarization following bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. SIRT1/2-mediated gains of methylation concur with decreases in activating histone marks, and their inhibition revert these histone marks to resemble an open chromatin. Remarkably, specific inhibition of DNA methyltransferases is sufficient to upregulate inflammatory genes that are maintained in a silent state by SIRT1/2. Both SIRT1 and SIRT2 directly interact with DNMT3B, and their binding to proinflammatory genes is lost upon exposure to LPS or through pharmacological inhibition of their activity. In all, we describe a novel role for SIRT1/2 to restrict premature activation of proinflammatory genes.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

The presence of gDNA suggests that different intracellular compartments contribute to exosome loading, resulting in distinct exosome subpopulations. However, the loading of gDNA and other nuclear contents into exosomes (nExo) remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the relationship between cancer cell micronuclei (MN), which are markers of genomic instability, and nExo formation. Imaging flow cytometry analyses reveal that 10% of exosomes derived from cancer cells and <1% of exosomes derived from blood and ascites from patients with ovarian cancer carry nuclear contents. Treatment with genotoxic drugs resulted in increased MN and nExos both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that multivesicular body precursors and exosomal markers, such as the tetraspanins, directly interact with MN.

Methods: Considering this interaction at the reductase site of FAS (I) responsible for reduction of beta-ketoacyl-CoA to beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, we hypothesized that POE containing a bioreducible center in its alkyl part might show an increased anti-tubercular activity due to the involvement of FAS (I) in extra bio-reduction reaction. Thus, we synthesized novel POEs, confirmed their structures by spectral data, and subsequently evaluated their anti-mycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) (H37Rv) strain at 10 mug/mL concentration. Results: Compounds 3c, 3j, and 3m showed higher activity with regard to the inhibition of Mtb growth by 45.4, 45.7, and 51.2% respectively. Unexpectedly, the maltol derived POE 3l having the lowest log p value among the POEs indicated the highest anti-mycobacterial growth activity with 56% prevention. Compounds 3c and 3l showed no remarkable cytotoxicity on human macrophages at 10 mug/mL concentration as analyzed by xCELLigence real-time cell analysis. In further experiments, some of the tested POEs, unlike pyrazinamide (PZA), exhibited significant antibacterial and also anti-fungal activities. POEs showed an enhanced bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria as shown for Staphylococcus aureus , e.g. compound 3b with a MIC value of 125 mug/mL but not E. coli as a gram-negative bacteria, except for maltol derived POE (3l) that showed an inverse activity in the susceptibility test. In the anticancer activity test against the human leukemia K562 cell lines using MTT assay, compounds 3e and 3j showed the highest cytotoxic effect with IC50 values of 25+/-8.0 muMu and 25+/-5.0 muMu, respectively. Conclusion: It was found that the majority of POEs containing a bioreducible center showed higher inhibitory activities on Mtb growth when compared to the similar compounds without a bio-reducible functional group.",['(c) 2019 The Author(s).'],"['Khani-Meinagh, Hossein', 'Mostafavi, Hossein', 'Reiling, Norbert', 'Mahdavi, Majid', 'Zarrini, Gholamreza']","['Khani-Meinagh H', 'Mostafavi H', 'Reiling N', 'Mahdavi M', 'Zarrini G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7821-9075'],"['Department of Organic and Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz 5166614766, Iran.', 'Department of Organic and Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz 5166614766, Iran.', 'Division of Microbial Interface Biology, Research Center Borstel, Leibniz Lung Center, Parkallee 22, D-23845 Borstel, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Hamburg-Lubeck-Borstel, 23845 Borstel, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190522,Iran,Bioimpacts,BioImpacts : BI,101558125,,,,PMC6879708,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-Pyrazinoic acid ester', 'Bioreducible center', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Fatty acid biosynthesis', 'Mycobacterial growth inhibition']",2019/12/05 06:00,2019/12/05 06:01,['2019/12/05 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/bi.2019.25 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioimpacts. 2019;9(4):199-209. doi: 10.15171/bi.2019.25.

Moreover, it can bridge other therapeutic strategies and greatly improve patient prognosis, with broad applicable prospects. Even so, 30-60% patients relapse after treatment, probably due to persistence of CAR T-cells and escape or downregulation of CD19 antigen, which is a great challenge for disease control. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that underlie post-CAR relapse and establishing corresponding prevention and treatment strategies is important.

CD105 (Endoglin) is a type I transmembrane protein reported to induce activation and proliferation of endothelial cells. In addition, CD105 is expressed in haematological malignancies and the vessels of solid tumours. Here, CD105 associates with unfavourable disease course, but so far no data are available on the prognostic relevance of CD105 in haematological malignancies. We here generated a novel CD105 antibody for analysis of expression and prognostic relevance of CD105 in a cohort of 62 AML patients. Flow cytometric analysis revealed substantial expression in the various AML FAB types, with FAB M3 type displaying significantly lower surface levels. Next we established a cut-off specific fluorescence level of 5.22 using receiver-operating characteristics, which allowed to group patients in cases with CD105(lo) and CD105(hi) surface expression and revealed that high CD105 expression correlated significantly with poor overall and progression free survival.

The amyloid deposits lead to organ failure and death. Our laboratory is specifically interested in cardiac involvement of AL amyloidosis. We have previously shown that the fibrillar aggregates of LC proteins can be cytotoxic and arrest the growth of human RFP-AC16 cardiomyocytes in vitro. We showed that adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSC) can rescue the cardiomyocytes from the fibril-induced growth arrest through contact-dependent mechanisms. In this study, we examined the transcriptome changes of human cardiomyocytes and AMSC in the presence of AL amyloid fibrils. The presence of fibrils causes a 'priming' immune response in AMSC associated with interferon associated genes. Exposure to AL fibrils induced changes in the pathways associated with immune response and extracellular matrix components in cardiomyocytes. We also observed upregulation of innate immune-associated transcripts (chemokines, cytokines, and complement), suggesting that amyloid fibrils initiate an innate immune response on these cells, possibly due to phenotypic transformation. This study corroborates and expands our previous studies and identifies potential new immunologic mechanisms of action for fibril toxicity on human cardiomyocytes and AMSC rescue effect on cardiomyocytes.",,"['Jordan, Torri L', 'Maar, Khansaa', 'Redhage, Keely R', 'Misra, Pinaki', 'Blancas-Mejia, Luis M', 'Dick, Christopher J', 'Wall, Jonathan S', 'Williams, Angela', 'Dietz, Allan B', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Lin, Yi', 'Ramirez-Alvarado, Marina']","['Jordan TL', 'Maar K', 'Redhage KR', 'Misra P', 'Blancas-Mejia LM', 'Dick CJ', 'Wall JS', 'Williams A', 'Dietz AB', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Lin Y', 'Ramirez-Alvarado M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5185-1890', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3410-9621', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4458-0946']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Radiology, the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Radiology, the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Immune Progenitor Adoptive Cell Therapy (IMPACT) Lab, Division of Transfusion Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Immune Progenitor Adoptive Cell Therapy (IMPACT) Lab, Division of Transfusion Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

PATIENT AND METHODS: A cohort of 60 T-ALL cases was included in this study. Sanger sequencing were done for NOTCH1 exon 26, 27, and distal part of exon 34 expanding the sequences encoding transcription activation domain (TAD) and a peptide sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, threonine (PEST) domains in all studied T ALL patients at diagnosis. RESULTS: NOTCH1 mutations was detected in 40 out of 60 T-ALL patients (66%). Mutations in T-ALL patients are deletions (22 mutations) and point mutation (10 mutations). NOTCH1 mutations was found to have no significant impact on clinical outcome and prognosis in T-ALL including overall survival, progression free survival, relapse and mortality (P> 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: NOTCH1 mutations were frequently detected in T All patients; however, these mutations did not affect the T ALL patient's outcome. The high prevalence of NOTCH1 mutations at diagnosis could be used for detection of minimal residual disease in T ALL.",,"['Aref, Salah', 'El Agdar, Mohammed', 'Salama, Osama', 'Zeid, Tarek Abouzeid', 'Sabry, Mohamed']","['Aref S', 'El Agdar M', 'Salama O', 'Zeid TA', 'Sabry M']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['NOTCH1', 'T-ALL', 'mutations', 'prognosis']",2019/12/05 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/12/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM190967 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-190967 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;27(2):157-162. doi: 10.3233/CBM-190967.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of the lncRNA-disease associations have not been found yet due to high costs and time complexity of traditional bio-experiments. Hence, it is quite urgent and necessary to establish efficient and reasonable computational models to predict potential associations between lncRNAs and diseases. RESULTS: In this manuscript, a novel prediction model called TCSRWRLD is proposed to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations based on improved random walk with restart. In TCSRWRLD, a heterogeneous lncRNA-disease network is constructed first by combining the integrated similarity of lncRNAs and the integrated similarity of diseases. And then, for each lncRNA/disease node in the newly constructed heterogeneous lncRNA-disease network, it will establish a node set called TCS (Target Convergence Set) consisting of top 100 disease/lncRNA nodes with minimum average network distances to these disease/lncRNA nodes having known associations with itself. Finally, an improved random walk with restart is implemented on the heterogeneous lncRNA-disease network to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations. The major contribution of this manuscript lies in the introduction of the concept of TCS, based on which, the velocity of convergence of TCSRWRLD can be quicken effectively, since the walker can stop its random walk while the walking probability vectors obtained by it at the nodes in TCS instead of all nodes in the whole network have reached stable state. And Simulation results show that TCSRWRLD can achieve a reliable AUC of 0.8712 in the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV), which outperforms previous state-of-the-art results apparently. Moreover, case studies of lung cancer and leukemia demonstrate the satisfactory prediction performance of TCSRWRLD as well. CONCLUSIONS: Both comparative results and case studies have demonstrated that TCSRWRLD can achieve excellent performances in prediction of potential lncRNA-disease associations, which imply as well that TCSRWRLD may be a good addition to the research of bioinformatics in the future.",,"['Li, Jiechen', 'Li, Xueyong', 'Feng, Xiang', 'Wang, Bing', 'Zhao, Bihai', 'Wang, Lei']","['Li J', 'Li X', 'Feng X', 'Wang B', 'Zhao B', 'Wang L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5065-8447'],"[""College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, XiangTan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, XiangTan, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Anhui University of Technology, Anhui, 243002, Maanshan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, XiangTan, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Computer Engineering & Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for Internet of Things and Information Security, Xiangtan University, XiangTan, People's Republic of China. wanglei@xtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['61873221/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '61672447/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018JJ4058/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province', '2017JJ5036/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province', 'NGII20160305/CERNET Next Generation Internet Technology Innovation Project', 'NGII20170109/CERNET Next Generation Internet Technology Innovation Project']",['Journal Article'],20191203,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Probability', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results']",PMC6889579,,['NOTNLM'],"['Global set', 'Heterogeneous network', 'Potential lncRNA-disease association prediction', 'Random walk with restart', 'Target convergence set']",2019/12/05 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/12/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-019-3216-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-019-3216-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2019 Dec 3;20(1):626. doi: 10.1186/s12859-019-3216-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among five-year survivors of primary cancer, SMNs account for nearly half of non-relapse deaths, which make them the most frequent cause of non-relapse mortality. Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer and the five-year survival rate of leukemia has drastically improved over the past two decades. Therefore, the chances of developing SMNs are higher in pediatric (0-19 years) leukemia survivors. METHODS: The US based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER-18) database (1973-2014) was probed for SMNs in the pediatric population (age </= 19). Variables Sequence-number central, primary site and ICCC3WHO were used to identify the first and second cancers among patients who developed SMN. RESULTS: Our SEER database analysis found 99,380 cases of pediatric primary malignancies (0-19 years), of which 1803 (1.81%) patients developed SMN. The breakdown of SMNs in pediatric leukemia survivors (n = 251) showed thyroid carcinoma (18.33% of cases) as the most common second cancer, followed by sarcoma (15.14%), astrocytoma (10.36%), lymphoma (9.56%), salivary gland carcinoma (7.17%), melanoma (4.38%), and breast cancer (3.98%). Interestingly, we found that over 76% of SMNs that were developed by leukemia patients occurred within 20 years after initial leukemia diagnosis. However, some SMNs occur during later age, for example, the mean age for breast cancer occurrence in leukemia survivors is 26.20 +/- 8.53 years after initial leukemia diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented comprehensive rates of SMNs among pediatric cancers survivors, and the potential SMNs for pediatric leukemia survivors. This information could we used by oncologists, patients, patient families, and cancer researchers to understand the long-term risks that are associated with the development of SMNs in pediatric leukemia survivors.",,"['Yavvari, Siddhartha', 'Makena, Yasaswi', 'Sukhavasi, Sahithi', 'Makena, Monish Ram']","['Yavvari S', 'Makena Y', 'Sukhavasi S', 'Makena MR']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.', 'Department of Biotechnology, GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, AP 530045, India.', 'Center for Distance Learning, GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, AP 530045, India.', 'Department of Physiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191129,Switzerland,Children (Basel),"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",101648936,,,,PMC6956149,,['NOTNLM'],"['*SEER', '*leukemia', '*pediatric cancers', '*second malignant neoplasms']",2019/12/05 06:00,2019/12/05 06:01,['2019/12/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/05 06:01 [medline]']","['children6120130 [pii]', '10.3390/children6120130 [doi]']",epublish,Children (Basel). 2019 Nov 29;6(12). pii: children6120130. doi: 10.3390/children6120130.,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The osmotic behavior of an individual Jurkat cell to water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a commonly used cryoprotective agent (CPA), under constant temperature, was recorded under a microscope utilizing the modified microfluidic system. The images of the Jurkat cell under osmotic change were processed to obtain a relationship between cell volume change and time. The experimental results were fitted using a two-parameter transport numeric model to calculate the Jurkat cell membrane permeability to water and DMSO at room temperature (22 degrees C).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to be elevated in a wide range of cancers including AML. Whilst previously thought to be mere by-products of cellular metabolism, it is now clear that ROS modulate the function of signalling proteins through oxidation of critical cysteine residues. In this way, ROS have been shown to regulate normal haematopoiesis as well as promote leukaemogenesis in AML. In addition, ROS promote genomic instability by damaging DNA, which promotes chemotherapy resistance. The source of ROS in AML appears to be derived from members of the ""NOX family"" of NADPH oxidases. Most studies link NOX-derived ROS to activating mutations in the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Ras). Targeting ROS through either ROS induction or ROS inhibition provides a novel therapeutic target in AML. In this review, we summarise the role of ROS in normal haematopoiesis and in AML.

This has prompted investigation into novel immunotherapies for sarcomas, especially after their recent and well-recognized successes in other cancers. One such modality, the Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell therapy, has shown promising results in treating B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This novel therapy functions by fusing a specific antibody derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with a T-cell which recognizes a specific tumor-associated antigen (TAA). Several sarcoma-associated antigens (SAA) amenable to CAR-T cell treatment have recently emerged with encouraging results. These include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), disialoganglioside (GD2), interleukin 11 Receptor Subunit Alpha (IL-11RA), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), B7-H3, CD44v6, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), and tyrosine kinase orphan-like receptor 1 (ROR1). Given the limitations of current medical therapies, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. As a sarcoma treatment modality, CAR-T cell therapy is highly promising and continues to draw interest especially as new clinical trials emerge.

Previous studies suggested that chronic B-cell receptor signaling and increased NF-kappaB activation contribute to ABC DLBCL survival. Here we show that the activity of the transcription factor NFAT is chronically elevated in both DLBCL subtypes. Surprisingly, NFAT activation is independent of B-cell receptor signaling, but mediated by an increased calcium flux and calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT. Intriguingly, although NFAT is activated in both DLBCL subtypes, long-term calcineurin inhibition with cyclosporin A or FK506, both clinically approved drugs, triggers potent cytotoxicity specifically in ABC DLBCL cells. The antitumor effects of calcineurin inhibitors are associated with the reduced expression of c-Jun, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10, which were identified as NFAT target genes that are particularly important for the survival of ABC DLBCL. Furthermore, calcineurin blockade synergized with BCL-2 and MCL-1 inhibitors in killing ABC DLBCL cells. Collectively, these findings identify constitutive NFAT signaling as a crucial functional driver of ABC DLBCL and highlight calcineurin inhibition as a novel strategy for the treatment of this aggressive lymphoma subtype.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bucher, Philip', 'Erdmann, Tabea', 'Grondona, Paula', 'Xu, Wendan', 'Schmitt, Anja', 'Schurch, Christoph', 'Zapukhlyak, Myroslav', 'Schonfeld, Caroline', 'Serfling, Edgar', 'Kramer, Daniela', 'Grau, Michael', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Hailfinger, Stephan']","['Bucher P', 'Erdmann T', 'Grondona P', 'Xu W', 'Schmitt A', 'Schurch C', 'Zapukhlyak M', 'Schonfeld C', 'Serfling E', 'Kramer D', 'Grau M', 'Klener P', 'Lengerke C', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Lenz G', 'Hailfinger S']",,"['Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Charles University General Hospital Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC 2180) ""Image-Guided and Functionally Instructed Tumor Therapies,"" University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC 2180) ""Image-Guided and Functionally Instructed Tumor Therapies,"" University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcineurin/*chemistry', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,2019/12/04 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/12/04 06:00'],"['2019/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62313-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001866 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jan 9;135(2):121-132. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001866.,,,['Blood. 2020 Jan 9;135(2):81.

We undertook a detailed investigation of the biological and clinical features of 20 spontaneous CLL regression cases incorporating phenotypic, functional, transcriptomic, and genomic studies at sequential time points. All spontaneously regressed tumors were IGHV-mutated with no restricted IGHV usage or B-cell receptor (BCR) stereotypy. They exhibited shortened telomeres similar to nonregressing CLL, indicating prior proliferation. They also displayed low Ki-67, CD49d, cell-surface immunoglobulin M (IgM) expression and IgM-signaling response but high CXCR4 expression, indicating low proliferative activity associated with poor migration to proliferation centers, with these features becoming increasingly marked during regression. Spontaneously regressed CLL displayed a transcriptome profile characterized by downregulation of metabolic processes as well as MYC and its downstream targets compared with nonregressing CLL. Moreover, spontaneous regression was associated with reversal of T-cell exhaustion features including reduced programmed cell death 1 expression and increased T-cell proliferation. Interestingly, archetypal CLL genomic aberrations including HIST1H1B and TP53 mutations and del(13q14) were found in some spontaneously regressing tumors, but genetic composition remained stable during regression. Conversely, a single case of CLL relapse following spontaneous regression was associated with increased BCR signaling, CLL proliferation, and clonal evolution. These observations indicate that spontaneously regressing CLL appear to undergo a period of proliferation before entering a more quiescent state, and that a complex interaction between genomic alterations and the microenvironment determines disease course. Together, the findings provide novel insight into the biological processes underpinning spontaneous CLL regression, with implications for CLL treatment.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kwok, Marwan', 'Oldreive, Ceri', 'Rawstron, Andy C', 'Goel, Anshita', 'Papatzikas, Grigorios', 'Jones, Rhiannon E', 'Drennan, Samantha', 'Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Sharma-Oates, Archana', 'Evans, Paul', 'Smith, Edward', 'Dalal, Surita', 'Mao, Jingwen', 'Hollows, Robert', 'Gordon, Naheema', 'Hamada, Mayumi', 'Davies, Nicholas J', 'Parry, Helen', 'Beggs, Andrew D', 'Munir, Talha', 'Moreton, Paul', 'Paneesha, Shankara', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Taylor, A Malcolm R', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Baird, Duncan M', 'Cazier, Jean-Baptiste', 'Moss, Paul', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Kwok M', 'Oldreive C', 'Rawstron AC', 'Goel A', 'Papatzikas G', 'Jones RE', 'Drennan S', 'Agathanggelou A', 'Sharma-Oates A', 'Evans P', 'Smith E', 'Dalal S', 'Mao J', 'Hollows R', 'Gordon N', 'Hamada M', 'Davies NJ', 'Parry H', 'Beggs AD', 'Munir T', 'Moreton P', 'Paneesha S', 'Pratt G', 'Taylor AMR', 'Forconi F', 'Baird DM', 'Cazier JB', 'Moss P', 'Hillmen P', 'Stankovic T']",,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Haematology, Pinderfields General Hospital, Wakefield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom;

A randomized, phase II trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design was conducted to investigate the effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproate and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in treatment-naive elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients (median age, 76 years; range, 61-92 years) ineligible for induction chemotherapy received decitabine (20 mg/m(2) intravenously, days 1 to 5) alone (n = 47) or in combination with valproate (n = 57), ATRA (n = 46), or valproate + ATRA (n = 50). The primary endpoint was objective response, defined as complete and partial remission, tested at a one-sided significance level of alpha = .10. Key secondary endpoints were overall survival, event-free survival, and progression-free survival and safety. RESULTS: The addition of ATRA resulted in a higher remission rate (21.9% with ATRA v 13.5% without ATRA; odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.86 to 3.79; one-sided P = .06). For valproate, no effect was observed (17.8% with valproate v 17.2% without valproate; odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.21; one-sided P = .44). Median overall survival was 8.2 months with ATRA v 5.1 months without ATRA (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89; two-sided P = .006). Improved survival was observed across risk groups, including patients with adverse cytogenetics, and was associated with longer response duration. With valproate, no survival difference was observed. Toxicities were predominantly hematologic, without relevant differences between the 4 arms. CONCLUSION: The addition of ATRA to decitabine resulted in a higher remission rate and a clinically meaningful survival extension in these patients with difficult-to-treat disease, without added toxicity.",,"['Lubbert, Michael', 'Grishina, Olga', 'Schmoor, Claudia', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Crysandt, Martina', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Salih, Helmut R',

However, the expression pattern of EZH2 remains controversial in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). EZH1/2 expression and mutation were analysed in 200 patients with AML. EZH2 expression was significantly decreased in AML patients compared with normal controls but not for EZH1 expression. EZH2 mutation was identified three of the 200 AML patients (1.5%, 3/200), whereas none of the patients harboured EZH1 mutation (0%, 0/200). EZH2 expression and mutation were significantly associated with -7/del(7) karyotypes. Moreover, lower EZH2 expression was associated with older age, higher white blood cells, NPM1 mutation, CEBPA wild-type and WT1 wild-type. Patients with EZH2 mutation showed shorter overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) than patients without EHZ2 mutation after receiving autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, EZH2 expression has no effect on OS and LFS of AML patients. Notably, in EZH2 low group, patients undergone HSCT had significantly better OS and LFS compared with patients only received chemotherapy, whereas no significant difference was found in OS and LFS between chemotherapy and HSCT patients in EZH2 high group. Collectively, EZH2 dysregulation caused by mutation and under-expression identifies specific subtypes of AML EZH2 dysregulation may be acted as potential biomarkers predicting prognosis and guiding the treatment choice between transplantation and chemotherapy.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

More recently, Bt crystal proteins known as parasporins have been discovered, that have no known insecticidal activity but target some human cancer cells exhibiting strong cytocidal activities with different toxicity spectra and varied activity levels. Parasporin-3, also called Cry41Aa, has only been shown to exhibit cytocidal activity towards HL-60 (Human promyelocytic leukemia cells) and HepG2 (Human liver cancer cells) cell lines after being proteolytically cleaved. In order to understand this activation mechanism various mutations were made in the N-terminal region of the protein and the toxicity against both HepG2 and HL-60 cell lines was evaluated. Our results indicate that only N-terminal cleavage is required for activation and that N-terminally deleted mutants show some toxicity without the need for proteolytic activation. Furthermore, we have shown that the level of toxicity towards the two cell lines depends on the protease used to activate the toxin. Proteinase K-activated toxin was significantly more toxic towards HepG2 and HL-60 than trypsin-activated toxin. N-terminal sequencing of activated toxins showed that this difference in toxicity is associated with a difference of just two amino acids (serine and alanine at positions 59 and 60, respectively) which we hypothesize occlude a binding motif.","['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

Recently, it has been focused on its anticancer activities, and no information showing its immune effects on leukemia mice was reported. In this study, we investigated the immune effects of cardamonin on WEHI-3 cell-generated leukemia mice. Forty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: Group I mice were normal animals and groups II-IV were leukemia. Group II mice, as a positive control, were administered with normal diet, and group III and IV mice were treated with 1 and 5 mg/kg of cardamonin, respectively, by intraperitoneal injection every 2 days for 14 days. The population of white blood cells, macrophage phagocytosis, and the proliferations of T and B cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Another forty mice were also separated randomly into four groups for the determination of survival rate. Results showed that cardamonin did not affect body weight. Cardamonin decreased CD3, CD11b, and Mac-3 cell populations but increased CD19 number. Cardamonin enhanced phagocytic abilities of macrophages from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of leukemia mice. Furthermore, cardamonin at 1 mg/kg treatment improved the survival rate of leukemia mice in vivo.

The study aimed to investigate whether the let-7f mediate the Adriamycin (ADR) resistance of leukemia, and to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and the soft agar clone formation assay. Flow cytometry was performed to detected cell cycle and apoptosis. The targeted regulationship was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to measure the expressions of let-7f, ABCC5, ABCC10, cell cycle-related proteins, and apoptosis-related proteins. The xenograft mouse model was used to conduct the tumor formation assay in vivo. The results demonstrated that the expression of let-7f was lower in multidrug-resistant K562/A02 cell lines compared to that in K562, while ABCC5 and ABCC10 were upregulated. Overexpression of let-7f in K562/A02 cell lines downregulated the ABCC5 and ABCC10 expression, enhanced cell sensitivity to ADR, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation. let-7f was proved to negatively regulate ABCC5 and ABCC10. Tumor formation assay further determined that let-7f overexpression increased sensitivity to ADR. Taken together, the let-7f downregulation induced the ADR resistance of leukemia by upregulating ABCC5 and ABCC10 expression. Our study provided a novel perspective to study the mechanism of MDR and a new target for the reversal of MDR.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Cao, Yi-Xiong', 'Wen, Feng', 'Luo, Ze-Yu', 'Long, Xing-Xing', 'Luo, Cong', 'Liao, Pei', 'Li, Jun-Jun']","['Cao YX', 'Wen F', 'Luo ZY', 'Long XX', 'Luo C', 'Liao P', 'Li JJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2448-1059'],"['Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department Of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191202,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adriamycin', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*let-7f', '*multidrug resistance']",2019/12/04 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2019/12/04 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29541 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Oct;121(10):4022-4033. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29541.

It is challenging to determine the optimal dose in children of different age groups. In addition, anticancer drugs display severe side effects reducing the quality of life. Late effects like secondary tumours and cardiotoxicity can be apparent years after treatment and must be taken into account when planning treatment schedules. Classical cytoreducing agents are still of great importance in treating children with leukaemia and solid tumours. In addition, drugs developed by rational drug design (targeted drugs) are a very important part of many treatment protocols, and newer drugs are emerging in several types of cancer. Unfortunately, there is only limited experience with newer drugs in children, because new drugs are mostly developed for adults.

However, the on-target and dose-limiting thrombocytopenia limits the use of BCL-XL inhibitors, such as ABT263, as safe and effective anticancer agents. To reduce the toxicity of ABT263, we converted it into DT2216, a BCL-XL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), that targets BCL-XL to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase for degradation. We found that DT2216 was more potent against various BCL-XL-dependent leukemia and cancer cells but considerably less toxic to platelets than ABT263 in vitro because VHL is poorly expressed in platelets. In vivo, DT2216 effectively inhibits the growth of several xenograft tumors as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, without causing appreciable thrombocytopenia. These findings demonstrate the potential to use PROTAC technology to reduce on-target drug toxicities and rescue the therapeutic potential of previously undruggable targets.

We present a single-cell framework that integrates highly multiplexed protein quantification, transcriptome profiling and analysis of chromatin accessibility. Using this approach, we establish a normal epigenetic baseline for healthy blood development, which we then use to deconvolve aberrant molecular features within blood from patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia(4,5). Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity within the patient cohort, we observe common malignant signatures across patients as well as patient-specific regulatory features that are shared across phenotypic compartments of individual patients. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin-accessibility maps identified 91,601 putative peak-to-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate leukemia-specific genes, such as RUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal to the marker gene CD69. These results demonstrate how integrative, multiomic analysis of single cells within the framework of normal development can reveal both distinct and shared molecular mechanisms of disease from patient samples.",,"['Granja, Jeffrey M', 'Klemm, Sandy', 'McGinnis, Lisa M', 'Kathiria, Arwa S', 'Mezger, Anja', 'Corces, M Ryan', 'Parks, Benjamin', 'Gars, Eric', 'Liedtke, Michaela', 'Zheng, Grace X Y', 'Chang, Howard Y', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Greenleaf, William J']","['Granja JM', 'Klemm S', 'McGinnis LM', 'Kathiria AS', 'Mezger A', 'Corces MR', 'Parks B', 'Gars E', 'Liedtke M', 'Zheng GXY', 'Chang HY', 'Majeti R', 'Greenleaf WJ']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7556-6795', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0261-7472', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5006-3785', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9459-4393', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1409-3095']","['Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Biophysics Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. klemm@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. lisa.mcginnis@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. lisa.mcginnis@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Stanford University School of Engineering, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', '10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA.', 'Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, CA, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. wjg@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. wjg@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. wjg@stanford.edu.', 'Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. wjg@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['RM1 HG007735/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 AG059918/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HG007735/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 HG009436/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA209919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 HG009442/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191202,United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Epigenomics/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",PMC7258684,['NIHMS1590877'],,,2019/12/04 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2019/12/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41587-019-0332-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41587-019-0332-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2019 Dec;37(12):1458-1465. doi: 10.1038/s41587-019-0332-7.

The dosage and intensity of therapy are based on surrogate markers such as peripheral blood leukocyte and neutrophil counts. Dosage based leukocyte count predictions could provide support for dosage decisions clinicians face trying to find and maintain an appropriate dosage for the individual patient. We present two Bayesian nonlinear state space models for predicting patient leukocyte counts during the maintenance therapy. The models simplify some aspects of previously proposed models but allow for some extra flexibility. Our second model is an extension which accounts for extra variation in the leukocyte count due to a treatment adversity, infections, using C-reactive protein as a surrogate.

In ALL, PACSIN2 rs2413739 T allele was associated with a significant reduction of TPMT activity in erythrocytes (p = 0.0094, linear mixed-effect model, multivariate analysis considering TPMT genotype) and increased severe gastrointestinal toxicity during consolidation therapy (p = 0.049). A similar trend was present also for severe hematological toxicity during maintenance. In IBD, no significant effect of rs2413739 could be found on TPMT activity, however azathioprine effectiveness was reduced in patients carrying the T allele (linear mixed effect, p = 0.0058). In PBMC from healthy donors, a positive correlation between PACSIN2 and TPMT protein concentration could be detected (linear mixed effect, p = 0.045). These results support the role of PACSIN2 polymorphism on TPMT activity and mercaptopurine adverse effects in patients with ALL.

Advances in genomic analyses have identified novel lesions including mutations in genes that encode chromatin modifiers and those that influence cytokine and kinase signalling, rendering many of these alterations potentially targetable by tyrosine kinase and epigenetic inhibitors currently in clinical use. Although specific genomic lesions, gene expression patterns, and immunophenotypic profiles have been associated with specific clinical outcomes in some cancers, the application of precision medicine approaches based on these data has been slow. This approach is complicated by the reality that patients often harbour multiple mutations, and in many cases, the precise functional significance and interaction of these mutations in driving leukaemia and drug responsiveness/resistance remains unknown. Given that signalling pathways driving leukaemic pathogenesis could plausibly result from the co-existence of specific lesions and the resultant perturbation of protein interactions, the use of combined therapeutics that target multiple aberrant pathways, according to an individual's mutational profile, might improve outcomes and lower a patient's risk of relapse.

It achieves its function by interacting with DNA. Therefore, the binding interactions of such drugs with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an important subject for pharmaceutical and biochemical studies aiming at designing better DNA binding drugs. Although DNA binding mode of some of the anti-neoplastic drugs has been studied, DNA interaction of Fludarabine has not been explored yet. For this reason, this work has been dedicated to deciphering the experimental and theoretical investigation of Fludarabine binding mechanism via multispectroscopic techniques including UV absorption spectroscopy, thermal denaturation, fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy, electrochemical and viscosity measurement methods as well as with molecular docking studies under physiological conditions. We observed in the lowest energy docking poses that Fludarabine binds to DNA via major groove binding mode. The nonplanar and extended structure and hydrogen bonding interactions of Fludarabine with the Adenine-Thymine base-pair played a very decisive role in the binding mode as supported by the experimental results.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

RESULTS: The extent of identified changes in CLL cells versus memory B cells from healthy donors was termed ""epigenetic burden"" (EB) whereas the number of changes between the pre-treatment versus the relapse sample was termed ""relapse changes"" (RC). Significant (p < 0.05) associations were identified between (i) high EB and short time-to-first-treatment (TTFT); and, (ii) few RCs and short time-to-relapse. Both the EB and the RC clustered in specific genomic regions and chromatin states, including regulatory regions containing binding sites of transcription factors implicated in B cell and CLL biology.

All three families of epigenetic proteins-readers, writers, and erasers-are druggable targets that can be addressed through small-molecule inhibitors. At present, a few drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes as well as analogues of epigenetic modifications have been introduced into the clinic use (e.g. to treat haematological malignancies), and a wide range of epigenetic-based drugs are undergoing clinical trials. Here, we describe the timeline of epigenetic drug discovery and development beginning with the early design based solely on phenotypic observations to the state-of-the-art rational epigenetic drug discovery using validated targets. Finally, we will highlight some of the major aspects that need further research and discuss the challenges that need to be overcome to implement epigenetic drug discovery into clinical management of human disorders.

The current analysis assessed the prognostic value of MRD negativity at the end of inotuzumab treatment. All patients who received inotuzumab (n = 164) were included. Among patients with complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematologic response (CR/CRi; n = 121), MRD-negative status (by multiparametric flow cytometry) was defined as <1 x 10(-4) blasts/nucleated cells. MRD negativity was achieved in 76 patients at the end of treatment.

However, one of the major side effects of the continuous use of DOX is dose-dependent, long-term, and potentially lethal cardiovascular toxicity (congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy) in cancer survivors many years after cessation of chemotherapy. In addition, predisposition to cardiotoxicity varied considerably among individuals. The long-held notion that DOX cardiotoxicity is caused by reactive oxygen species formed from the redox-cycling of DOX semiquinone lacks rigorous proof in a chronic animal model, and administration of reactive oxygen species detoxifying agents failed to reverse DOX-induced cardiac problems. In this review, I discuss the pros and cons of the reactive oxygen species pathway as a primary or secondary mechanism of DOX cardiotoxicity, the role of topoisomerases, and the potential use of mitochondrial-biogenesis-enhancing compounds in reversing DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. New approaches for well-designed clinical trials that repurpose FDA-approved drugs and naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds prophylactically to prevent or mitigate cardiovascular complications in both pediatric and adult cancer survivors are needed.

Using data from the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation registry, we analyzed the outcomes of 129 children with JMML who underwent HSCT between 2000 and 2011. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and cumulative incidence of relapse were 64% and 34%, respectively. A regimen of busulfan/fludarabine/melphalan was the most commonly used (59 patients) and provided the best outcomes; the 5-year OS rate reached 73%, and the cumulative incidences of relapse and transplantation-related mortality were 26% and 9%, respectively. In contrast, the use of the irradiation-based myeloablative regimen was the most significant risk factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.92; P = .004) in the multivariate model. In addition, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was strongly associated with lower relapse (HR, 0.37; P = .029) and favorable survival (HR, 0.22; P = .006). The current study has shown that a significant proportion of children with JMML can be cured with HSCT, especially those receiving the busulfan/fludarabine/melphalan regimen. Based on the lower relapse and better survival observed in patients with chronic GVHD, additional treatment strategies that focus on enhancing graft-versus-leukemia effects may further improve survival.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the past few years, the C. elegans nervous system has emerged as an integral part of host defense against pathogens, acting through diverse mechanisms to repress or induce protective transcriptional responses to infection in distal tissues. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the mechanisms through which the C. elegans nervous system controls the expression of host defense genes in the intestinal epithelium.

The histone methyltransferase DOT1L, which mono-, di- and trimethylates H3K79 using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a co-factor, is involved in cell development, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage repair. However, changes in normal expression levels of this enzyme are found in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer. High levels of H3K79me are also detected in acute myeloid leukaemia patients bearing MLL rearrangements (MLL-r). MLL translocations are found in approximately 80% of paediatric patients, leading to poor prognosis. DOT1L is recruited on DNA and induces hyperexpression of HOXA9 and MEIS1. Based on these findings, selective drugs have been developed to induce apoptosis in MLL-r leukaemia cells by specifically inhibiting DOT1L.

However, there are no clear guidelines concerning prophylactic dose. AIMS: To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in a pediatric ALL population. The effect of patient characteristics and antileukemic treatment on ciprofloxacin exposure, the area under the concentration time curve over minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC24/MIC) ratios, and emergence of resistance were studied. METHODS: A total of 615 samples from 129 children (0-18 years) with ALL were collected in a multicenter prospective study. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Microbiological cultures were collected prior to and during prophylaxis. An AUC24/MIC of >/=125 was defined as target ratio. RESULTS: A 1-compartment model with zero-order absorption and allometric scaling best described the data. No significant (P < .01) covariates remained after backward elimination and no effect of asparaginase or azoles were found. Ciprofloxacin AUC24 was 16.9 mg*h/L in the prednisone prophase versus 29.3 mg*h/L with concomitant chemotherapy. Overall, 100%, 81%, and 18% of patients at, respectively, MIC of 0.063, 0.125, and 0.25 mg/L achieved AUC24/MIC >/= 125. In 13% of the patients, resistant bacteria were found during prophylactic treatment. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin exposure shows an almost 2-fold change throughout the treatment of pediatric ALL. Depending on the appropriateness of 125 as target ratio, therapeutic drug monitoring or dose adjustments might be indicated for less susceptible bacteria starting from >/= 0.125 mg/L to prevent the emergence of resistance and reach required targets for efficacy.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Here we show that high-level expression of these Src kinases predicts poor survival in a large cohort of AML patients. To test the therapeutic benefit of Flt3 and Src-family kinase inhibition, we used the pyrrolopyrimidine kinase inhibitor A-419259. This compound potently inhibits Hck, Fgr, and Lyn as well as Flt3 bearing an activating internal tandem duplication (ITD). Flt3-ITD expression sensitized human TF-1 myeloid cells to growth arrest by A-419259, supporting direct action on the Flt3-ITD kinase domain. Cells transformed with the Flt3-ITD mutants D835Y and F691L were resistant to A-419259, while co-expression of Hck or Fgr restored inhibitor sensitivity to Flt3-ITD D835Y. Conversely, Hck and Fgr mutants with engineered A-419259 resistance mutations decreased sensitivity of TF-1/Flt3-ITD cells. To investigate de novo resistance mechanisms, A-419259-resistant Flt3-ITD+ AML cell populations were derived via long-term dose escalation. Whole exome sequencing identified a distinct Flt3-ITD kinase domain mutation (N676S/T) among all A-419259 target kinases in each of six independent resistant cell populations.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colon cancer-associated transcript 1 (CCAT1) has been well known to play vital roles in multiple malignancies including AML. Unfortunately, the detailed mechanism of CCAT1 in AML progression remains obscure. In this study, we demonstrated that CCAT1 was up-regulated in AML samples while its target, miR-490-3p, was relatively down-regulated. CCAT1 markedly increased viability and metastasis of AML cells, while miR-490-3p had opposite effects. CCAT1 could specifically bind to miR-490-3p and reduce its expression and activity, and MAPK1 was a target gene of miR-490-3p. Overexpressed CCAT1 could induce MAPK1 expression and c-Myc reciprocally increased CCAT1 expression. Our data implied that miR-490-3p could be a novel therapeutic target for AML, and highlights the crucial role of CCAT1/miR-490-3p/MAPK1/c-Myc positive feedback loop in AML progression.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Homoharringtonine (HHT) is an approved treatment for adult patients with chronic or acceleratedphase CML who are resistant to TKIs and other therapies; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, HHT treatment demonstrated induction of apoptosis in imatinibresistant K562G cells by using MTS assay and western blotting, and BCRABL protein was reduced. CHX chase assay revealed that HHT induced degradation of the BCRABL protein, which could be reversed by autophagy lysosome inhibitors BafA1 and CQ. Next, HHT treatment confirmed the induction of autophagy in K562G cells, and silencing the key autophagic proteins ATG5 and Beclin1 inhibited the degradation of the BCRABL protein and cytotoxicity. In addition, autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1(p62) participated during the autophagic degradation of BCRABL induced by HHT, and this was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, in which HHT enhanced the ubiquitination of the BCRABL protein and promoted its binding to p62.

Several meridianin C derivatives (compounds 7aj) were recently synthesized, and their inhibitory effects on proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases, as well as their antiproliferative effects on human leukemia cells, were reported. However, the antileukemic effects and mechanisms of action of meridianin C and its derivatives remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of meridianin C and its derivatives on MV411 human acute myeloid leukemia cell growth. The parent compound meridianin C did not markedly affect the viability and survival of MV411 cells. By contrast, MV411 cell viability and survival were reduced by meridianin C derivatives, with compound 7a achieving the most prominent reduction. Compound 7a notably inhibited the expression and activity of PIM kinases, as evidenced by reduced Bcell lymphoma2 (Bcl2)associated death promoter phosphorylation at Ser112. However, meridianin C also suppressed PIM kinase expression and activity, and the panPIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 only slightly suppressed the survival of MV411 cells. Thus, the antisurvival effect of compound 7a on MV411 cells was unrelated to PIM kinase inhibition. Moreover, compound 7a induced apoptosis, caspase9 and 3 activation and poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, but did not affect death receptor (DR)4 or DR5 expression in MV411 cells. Compound 7a also induced the generation of cleaved Bcl2, and the downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl)1 and Xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in MV411 cells. Furthermore, compound 7a increased eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2alpha phosphorylation and decreased S6 phosphorylation, whereas GRP78 expression was unaffected. Importantly, treatment with a pancaspase inhibitor (zVADfmk) significantly attenuated compound 7ainduced apoptosis, caspase9 and 3 activation, PARP cleavage, generation of cleaved Bcl2 and downregulation of Mcl1 and XIAP in MV411 cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrated the strong antisurvival and proapoptotic effects of compound 7a on MV411 cells through regulation of caspase9 and 3, Bcl2, Mcl1, XIAP, eIF2alpha and S6 molecules.",,"['Cho, Hyorim', 'Yadav, Anil Kumar', 'Do, Youngrok', 'Heo, Mihwa', 'Bishop-Bailey, David', 'Lee, Jinho', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl']","['Cho H', 'Yadav AK', 'Do Y', 'Heo M', 'Bishop-Bailey D', 'Lee J', 'Jang BC']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, London NW 10TU, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Life Science, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191127,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (meridianin C)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,2019/12/04 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/12/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2019.4925 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2020 Jan;56(1):368-378. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2019.4925.

MS occurs in 3 to 8% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The overwhelming majority of MS occurs in the skin, bones, and gastrointestinal tract; intraoral MS (IMS) is extremely rare. METHODS: We describe a case of MS of the mandibular gingiva in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia that was in remission. We also present a review of the English and Japanese literature with a special focus on the management and prognosis of intraoral MS. RESULTS: The patient was discharged while in remission 8 months after the initial examination. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of IMS is extremely poor in general, and a diagnostic delay can prevent adequate therapy by hematologists and oncologists.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the CD22DeltaE12-specific signature transcriptome in human BPL cells and evaluate the clinical potential of a nanoscale formulation of CD22DeltaE12-siRNA as an RNAi therapeutic against drug-resistant BPL. CD22DeltaE12-siRNA nanoparticles significantly improved the event-free survival (EFS) outcome of NOD/SCID (NS) mice challenged with human BPL xenograft cells. Methods: Gene expression and translational bioinformatics methods were applied to examine the expression of the CD22DeltaE12-specific signature transcriptome in human BPL cells in subsets of BPL patients. Survival analysis for mice challenged with BPL cells and treated with CD22DeltaE12 siRNA was performed using standard methods. Results: Leukemia cells from CD22DeltaE12-Tg mice exhibit gene and protein expression profiles consistent with constitutive activation of multiple signaling networks, mimicking the profiles of relapsed BPL patients as well as newly diagnosed high-risk patients with BCR-ABL(+)/Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)(+) BPL as well as Ph-like BPL. A nanoscale formulation of CD22DeltaE12-siRNA abrogated the in vivo clonogenicity of the leukemia-initiating leukemic cell fraction in xenograft specimens derived from patients with relapsed BPL and significantly improved the EFS outcome of NS mice challenged with drug-resistant human BPL xenograft cells. Conclusion: The CD22-RNAi technology is applicable to all BPL patients both high risk and standard risk. That is because CD22DeltaE12 is a characteristic feature of drug-resistant leukemic clones that escape chemotherapy and cause relapse in both high risk and low risk subgroups of patients. The technology therefore has the potential (1) for prevention of relapses by selectively killing the clones that are most likely to escape chemotherapy and cause relapse as well (2) for treatment of relapses in BPL. This research project may also lead to innovative salvage regimens against other forms of CD22DeltaE12-positive relapsed B-lineage leukemias and lymphomas.",,"['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Qazi, Sanjive']","['Uckun FM', 'Qazi S']",,"['AresMIT Biomedical Computational Strategies (ABCS), Minneapolis, MN 55402, USA.', 'Ares Pharmaceuticals, LLC, St. Paul, MN 55110, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.', 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.', 'AresMIT Biomedical Computational Strategies (ABCS), Minneapolis, MN 55402, USA.', 'Ares Pharmaceuticals, LLC, St. Paul, MN 55110, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.', 'Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Program, Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN 56082, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA164098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20180319,United States,Cancer Drug Resist,"Cancer drug resistance (Alhambra, Calif.)",101738710,,,,PMC6883925,['NIHMS1059614'],['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'RNA interference', 'driver lesion', 'leukemia', 'nanomedicine', 'personalized medicine']",2018/01/01 00:00,2018/01/01 00:01,['2019/12/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.20517/cdr.2017.03 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Drug Resist. 2018;1:30-47. doi: 10.20517/cdr.2017.03.

PLC is involved in cancer migration, invasion and drug resistance. However, the expression status and prognostic role of PLCB4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unclear. In the present study, the complete clinical and mRNA expression data of 285 pediatric patients with de novo AML were obtained from the Therapeutically Available Research to Generate Effective Treatments database. The association between PLCB4 expression and clinical and molecular features was explored. The expression of PLCB4 was significantly higher in patients with AML who relapsed compared with those with long-term complete remission. Patients with PLCB4 upregulation had significantly lower overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) rate compared with those with low PLCB4 expression. Multivariate Cox's regression analyses demonstrated that high PLCB4 expression was an independent risk factor of adverse OS (P<0.01; HR, 2.081) and EFS (P<0.01; HR, 2.130). Following stratification analysis according to transplant status in cases of first complete remission, the patients with high expression of PLCB4 had significantly lower OS and EFS rate in the chemotherapy group, but not the stem cell transplant group. Furthermore, PLCB4-associated genes were identified using Spearman's rank correlation analysis. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that PLCB4 and its associated genes were mainly involved in three potential pathways, including the Rap1 signaling pathway. Overall, the findings of the present study suggest that increased PLCB4 expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in pediatric patients with AML, and thus may represent a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for AML.",['Copyright: (c) Wu et al.'],"['Wu, Shiwen', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Shen, Dongqin', 'Lu, Jianle', 'Zhao, Li']","['Wu S', 'Zhang W', 'Shen D', 'Lu J', 'Zhao L']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

Previous studies have revealed that ARC was upregulated in several different types of solid tumor, where it suppressed tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the increased expression levels of ARC in cancer cells contributed to the development of therapeutic resistance and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with leukemia.

Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that Parkin can promote cell death in the context of severe mitochondrial damage by degrading the pro-survival Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1. Therefore, Parkin may act as a 'switch' that can shift the balance between protective or pro-death pathways depending on the degree of mitochondrial damage. Here, we report that the Parkin interacting protein, Bcl-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5), impairs mitophagy by suppressing Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria and reducing the movement of damaged mitochondria into the lysosomes.

Conflicting evidence exists on the risk of infection in patients receiving ibrutinib. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate relative risk of infection with ibrutinib in B-cell malignancies. METHODS: A systematic search of Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, European Union Clinical Trials Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed through January 15, 2019, to identify randomized controlled trials comparing ibrutinib with other agents or placebo in B-cell malignancies. We pooled point estimates using the Der Simonian and Laird random-effects model. Statistical analyses were performed by Stata/SE 15.1. RESULTS: Seven studies randomizing 2167 patients were included in the final analysis. Treatment duration in studies ranged from 9.4 to 38.7 months. Ibrutinib was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection (any grade and grade 3-5) in patients with B-cell malignancies [pooled risk ratio (RR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.69, P = .015; and RR = 1.35, 95% CI, 1.05-1.74, P = .018, respectively]. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a significantly increased risk of grade 3-5 infection was noted in the ibrutinib group [pooled RR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.02-1.50, P = .028]. Incidences of pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis found that ibrutinib was associated with significantly higher risk of infections in patients with B-cell malignancies. Occurrence of major individual subtypes was not different between groups, possibly as a result of inconsistent reporting across studies.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Environment is the main source of Aspergillus spores aerosolization especially during building construction. International guidelines recommend mechanical protection during hospital building works; otherwise the use of antifungal prophylaxis is not clearly indicated. Our objective was to determine the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis by posaconazole on IA incidence in acute myeloid leukemia population and to analyse the benefit of this prophylaxis and HEPA-filters during hospital buildings works. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia at Brest teaching hospital from January 2009 to December 2015. We compared incidence of IA in the group treated by posaconazole from 2012 to 2015 to the incidence of IA in the first group who did not receive antifungal prophylaxis (from 2009 to 2011). The one-year overall survival was also analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 245 patients were enrolled including 151 treated with posaconazole. 23 IA were diagnosed between 2009 and 2011 (without antifungal prophylaxis), then 31 between 2012 and 2015 (with posaconazole) without statistical difference between the incidence densities (0.34 per 100 hospitalization-days vs. 0.30 per 100 hospitalization-days, p = 0.71). Incidence density of IA increased during building works (2.40 per 100 hospitalization-days vs. 0.28 per 100 hospitalization-days, p < 0.0001). The incidence density of IA significantly decreased during construction periods when posaconazole prophylaxis was used (1.59 per 100 hospitalization-days vs. 4.87 per 100 hospitalization-days p < 0.0001).

However, little is known about immunity in adult patients after treatment for hematological malignancies. In this study, we assessed serology levels against polio, diphtheria and tetanus in adult patients after conventional treatment for leukemia and lymphoma. PATIENTS: One hundred and four patients, age 61 (19-86) years, were included at a median of 18 (4-77) months after chemotherapy for acute leukemia (n = 24) or lymphoma (n = 80). Pre-treatment sera were available in 73 cases for a pre-versus post treatment comparison. Healthy, age- and sex matched controls were available for 47 pts. METHODS: Tetanus antibodies were quantified using ELISA, and antibody levels >/=0.01 IU/mL were considered protective. Diphtheria antibodies were analyzed using neutralization test (n = 60) or by ELISA (n = 44). In both tests values >/=0.01 IU/mL were considered protective. Antibodies against poliovirus serotype 1 and 3 were assessed by a neutralizing test. A microneutralization titer of >/=2 was considered protective. RESULTS: Tetanus: There were significantly more non-immune patients after treatment (24%), compared to before (12%), p = 0.02. Post-treatment antibody levels were significantly lower than pre-treatment levels (p = 0.02). Diphtheria: There was a trend, p = 0.06, towards more non-immune patients after treatment (21%) compared to before (27%). Antibody levels post treatment were lower than pre treatment levels (p = 0.03) and lower than controls (p = 0.01). Polio: There was no significant difference in the number of non-immune patients before vs after chemotherapy for either PV1 or PV3. Protective immunity against serotype 1 and 3 was preserved in 90 and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After standard chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma a significant proportion of patients had impaired humoral immunity to diphtheria and tetanus. However, polio immunity was well preserved.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Levels of 49 cytokines and chemokines, including osteopontin (OPN), were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with AE (n = 17) or febrile convulsion (FC; n = 8; control group). The AE group included acute necrotizing encephalopathy (n = 1), acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD; n = 3), clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS; n = 4), and unclassified acute encephalopathy (UCAE; n = 9) that does not meet the criteria of syndrome classification. Five individuals with AE had neurological sequelae or death (poor prognosis), whereas 12 were alive without neurological sequelae (good prognosis). RESULTS: The CSF:serum ratios of OPN, CC chemokine ligand (CCL)4, and interleukin (IL)-10 were significantly higher in AE than in FC. The CSF levels of macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were significantly higher in the poor-prognosis group than in the good-prognosis group. The CSF:serum ratios of OPN were significantly higher in AESD and in MERS than in FC. The CSF:serum ratios of MIF and OPN were higher in MERS than in UCAE or FC. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that microglia-related cytokines and chemokines such as OPN, MIF, and LIF could be novel biomarkers of AE, in addition to the previously reported IL-10 and CCL4, and that MIF and LIF may be markers of poor prognosis.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

The sR9-mediated heme oxygenase-1 siRNA (siHO-1) delivery efficiently enhanced apoptotic response to daunorubicin of AML cells and AML-targeted HO-1 silencing improved chemotherapy and prolonged survival in orthotopic myeloid leukemia model. CD64 expression was verified and HO-1-silencing-mediated chemo-sensitization was also validated in leukemic blast cells originated from AML M4/M5 patient's bone marrow.

However, once cancer arises, AMPK becomes a tumor promoter instead, driving cancer development. For such AMPK-driven cancers, AMPK blockade may be a valuable therapeutic strategy. Here we show that AMPK is upregulated in a variety of hematological cancers and plays key roles in maintaining viability of tumor cells. Blockade of AMPK signaling by dorsomorphin markedly induces apoptosis in Jurkat, K562 cell lines as well as primary cancerous B cells. Mechanistically, dorsomorphin significantly upregulates the expression of BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 gene family involved in initiating apoptosis. Reduction of BAD expression by RNA interference prevents apoptosis in response to AMPK inhibition. Thus, our data found BAD integrates the pro-apoptotic effects of dorsomorphin and provided novel insights into the mechanisms by which AMPK facilitates survival signaling in hematologic tumor cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: One-hundred twenty-seven children with ALL that received maintenance therapy were involved in this study. All patients were treated according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) based protocols. Myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity were evaluated using surrogate markers (median 6-MP dose, number of leukopenic episodes and levels of bilirubin and transaminases on each visit). RESULTS: Higher number of leukopenic episodes, as a surrogate marker of 6-MP myelotoxicity, was found in carriers of TYMS 3R3R and 3R4R genotypes (p=0.067) as well as in TYMS 3R6bp+ (28bp VNTR, 6bp indel) haplotype carriers (p=0.015). Carriers of DHFR CATAG (-680, -675, -556, -464, -317) haplotype were also found to have higher number of leukopenic episodes (p=0.070). SLC19A1 c.80A allele (p=0.079) and TYMS 2R6bp+ (5'UTR VNTR, 6bp indel) haplotype carriers (p=0.078) had fewer leukopenic episodes. No difference in genotype frequencies between the control group of volunteered blood donors and childhood ALL patients was found.

METHODS: Antiproliferative effects were evaluated with CCK8 cell viability assay and colony formation assay. Cell apoptotic effects were studied by (acridine orange) AO/ethidium bromide (EB) staining assay. To further estimate the extent of apoptosis, flow cytometry using annexin V assay was used. Effects on MMP were estimated by flow cytometry, while transwell migration assay was used to study the effects on cell migration and invasion. Protein expression was estimated by western blot method. RESULTS: The results showed that helenalin inhibits the growth of the HL60 cells significantly and exhibited an IC50 of 23.5 microM. In addition, it was observed that the anticancer effects of helenalin are due to induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis which was also associated with enhancement of the expression of Bax and decrease in the expression of Bcl-2. Helenalin also caused loss of MMP in the doxorubicin-resistant HL-60 cells and also inhibited their migratory and invasive properties via modulation of the PI3K/AKT/M-TOR signalling pathway.

Patient characteristics differed regarding conditioning intensity (myeloablative; 19.6% in HID-HSCT vs. 61.1% in non-HID-HSCT, P < 0.001) and having undergone multiple HSCT (26.1% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.045). However, we found no significant differences in the 1-year overall survival (OS, 31.7% vs. 29.1%; P = 0.25), disease-free survival (DFS, 20.5% vs. 23.7%; P = 0.23), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 40.0% vs. 42.8%; P = 0.92), non-relapse mortality (NRM, 39.5% vs. 33.5%; P = 0.22), or 100-day grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (32.6% vs. 34.7%; P = 0.64) following HID-HSCT vs. non-HID-HSCT, respectively. Subgroup analysis stratified by disease and intensity of conditioning regimen demonstrated the same results between HID-HSCT and non-HID-HSCT. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that HID-HSCT was not an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-1.58]), DFS (HR = 1.05 [95%CI, 0.67-1.68]), CIR (HR = 0.84 [95%CI, 0.48-1.47]), or NRM (HR = 1.28 [95%CI, 0.66-2.46]). In summary, transplant outcomes for RRAL were comparable in the HID-HSCT and non-HID-HSCT groups. HID-HSCT using very low-dose ATG and mPSL for RRAL may be a viable alternative to non-HID-HSCT.",,"['Konishi, Tatsuya', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Nagata, Akihito', 'Yamada, Yuta', 'Takezaki, Toshiaki', 'Kaito, Satoshi', 'Kurosawa, Shuhei', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Harada, Kaito', 'Yasuda, Shunichiro', 'Yoshioka, Kosuke', 'Inamoto, Kyoko', 'Toya, Takashi', 'Igarashi, Aiko', 'Najima, Yuho', 'Kobayashi, Takeshi', 'Kakihana, Kazuhiko', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru']","['Konishi T', 'Doki N', 'Nagata A', 'Yamada Y', 'Takezaki T', 'Kaito S', 'Kurosawa S', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Harada K', 'Yasuda S', 'Yoshioka K', 'Inamoto K', 'Toya T', 'Igarashi A', 'Najima Y', 'Kobayashi T', 'Kakihana K', 'Sakamaki H', 'Ohashi K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8661-3179'],"['Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan. n-doki@cick.jp.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8677, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20191130,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Recurrence']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Relapsed/refractory acute leukemia', 'Very low-dose antithymocyte globulin']",2019/12/02 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/12/02 06:00'],"['2019/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03865-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03865-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Jan;99(1):147-155. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03865-x.

The patterns on the cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging and positron emission tomography and the find of antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody on cerebral spinal fluid were in favor of a paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. In cerebral spinal fluid, there were no micro-organisms nor leukemic cells. We found no sign of cancer on full body computerized tomography-scan, on full-body PET and on rectosigmoidoscopy. The patient was treated by corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulins with success, but she died before receiving chemotherapy. It's known that anti- glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody is involved in paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is frequently associated with carcinoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma, but it was only reported associated with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in one case report.

We aimed to investigate the longitudinal genomic evolution of MPAL from diagnosis to relapse. METHODS: We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on bone marrow (BM) samples obtained at the four stages of this disease in a male patient with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) MPAL, including primary, complete cytogenetic remission (CCR), complete molecular remission (CMR), and relapse stage during the 3 year follow-up period. RESULTS: 156 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels were detected, which exhibited distinctive evolutionary behaviors. Seventeen mutations disappeared quickly upon DCTER treatment and never came back. Seven mutations, although disappeared initially, reoccurred with the withdrawal of TKI treatment. Notably, ten mutations emerged in spite of the active DCTER chemotherapy. Moreover, copy number loss played critical roles in monitoring MPAL progression, displaying 7, 0, 0, and 383 losses at the stages of primary, CCR, CMR, and relapse respectively. CONCLUSION: This longitudinal genomic investigation of the Ph+ MPAL patient established one MPAL evolution model in which the primary tumor acquired additional variations leading to tumor relapse. Moreover, the event of copy number loss remained a valuable hallmark in the progression of MPAL.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation parameters in 100 patients with R/R hematologic malignancies after receiving CAR-T cell therapy to illuminate the profiles of coagulation disorders and to facilitate the management of coagulation disorders. A high incidence of coagulation disorders was observed, including elevated D-dimer (50/100, 50%), increased fibrinogen degradation product (45/100, 45%), decreased fibrinogen (23/100, 23%), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (16/100, 16%), and prolonged prothrombin time (10/100, 10%). Coagulation disorders occurred mainly during day 6 to day 20 after CAR-T cell infusion. The changes in coagulation parameters were associated with high tumor burden in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more lines of prior therapies, lower baseline platelet count, and especially cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was found in 7 patients with grade >/=3 CRS and indicated a poor prognosis. Our study suggests that coagulation disorders are manageable in most patients after CAR-T cell therapy. Coexistence of DIC and severe CRS is closely related to nonrelapsed deaths during the acute toxicity phase, and effective and timely treatment is the key to reduce nonrelapse mortality for patients with DIC and severe CRS.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

How HOX gene-associated lncRNAs regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and contribute to leukemogenesis remains elusive. We found that HOTTIP is aberrantly activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to alter HOXA-driven topologically associated domain (TAD) and gene expression. HOTTIP loss attenuates leukemogenesis of transplanted mice, while reactivation of HOTTIP restores leukemic TADs, transcription, and leukemogenesis in the CTCF-boundary-attenuated AML cells. Hottip aberration in mice abnormally promotes HSC self-renewal leading to AML-like disease by altering the homeotic/hematopoietic gene-associated chromatin signature and transcription program.

Here, we synthesized ten chalcones and their corresponding flavanones and evaluated their antiproliferative activity against the human tumour cell line U-937. This series of chalcone derivatives was characterized by the presence of a naphthalene ring which was kept unaltered- and attached to the beta carbon of the 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-one framework. The structure-activity relationship of these chalcone derivatives and their corresponding cyclic compounds was investigated by the introduction of different substituents (methyl, methoxy, benzyloxy, chlorine) or by varying the position of the methoxy or benzyloxy groups on the A ring. The results revealed that both the chalcone containing the methoxy group at 5' position of the A ring as well as its corresponding flavanone [6-methoxy-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)chroman-4-one] were the most cytotoxic compounds, with IC50 values of 2.8 +/- 0.2 and 1.3 +/- 0.2 muM, respectively, against U-937 cells. This synthetic flavanone was as cytotoxic as the antitumor etoposide in U-937 cells and displayed strong cytotoxicity against additional human leukaemia cell lines, including HL-60, MOLT-3 and NALM-6. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were more resistant than leukaemia cells to the cytotoxic effects of the flavanone. Treatment of U-937 cells with this compound induced G2-M cell cycle arrest, an increase in sub-G1 ratio and annexin-V positive cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase processing. Apoptosis induction triggered by this flavonoid was blocked by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This flavanone induces phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular-signal regulated kinases and c-jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) following different kinetics. Moreover, cell death was attenuated by the inhibition of mitogen-activated extracellular kinases and JNK/SAPK and was independent of reactive oxygen species generation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Notch1 activation causes release of intracellular Notch1 (ICN1, the activated form of Notch1) from cell membrane to cytoplasm. As a transcription factor, ICN1 must be transferred into nucleus and bind to the promoters of its downstream target genes. E3 ubiquitin ligase induces ICN1 degradation in cytoplasm, which blocks ICN1 transfer into the nucleus. Flavone is a natural plant polyphenol, demonstrated to have anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo in breast and colon cancers. However, the effects of flavone on leukemia have not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that flavone inhibited cell proliferation by down-regulating Notch1 signal pathway in CCRF-CEM and Molt-4 T-ALL cells. Flavone-mediated upregulation of c-Cbl level results in the increase in its interaction with ICN1, further caused ICN1 ubiquitinylation and degradation. Knockdown of c-Cbl reversed flavone-induced down-regulation of ICN1 and inhibition of cell proliferation in T-ALL cells. In short, this study indicated that flavone exerted resistance to T-ALL by promoting c-Cbl-induced ubiquitinylation and degradation of ICN1.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The development of novel technologies and targeted therapies have yielded new modalities to overcome drug resistance, but multidrug resistance (MDR) remains one of the major challenges in the treatment of cancer. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has a central role in regulating the levels and activities of a multitude of proteins as well as regulation of cell cycle, gene expression, response to oxidative stress, cell survival, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore, inhibition of the UPS could represent a novel strategy for the treatment and overcoming of drug resistance in chemoresistant malignancies. In 2003, bortezomib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). However, due to its limitations, second generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs) like carfilzomib, ixazomib, oprozomib, delanzomib and marizomib were introduced which displayed clinical activity in bortezomib-resistant tumors. Past studies have demonstrated that proteasome inhibition potentiates the anti-cancer efficacy of other chemotherapeutic drugs by: i) decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as TNF-alpha and NF-kB, ii) increasing the levels of Noxa, a pro-apoptotic protein, iii) activating caspases and inducing apoptosis, iv) degrading the pro-survival protein, induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1), and v) inhibiting drug efflux transporters. In addition, the mechanism of action of the immunoproteasome inhibitors, ONX-0914 and LU-102, suggested their therapeutic role in the combination treatment with PIs. In the current review, we discuss various PIs and their underlying mechanisms in surmounting anti-tumor drug resistance when used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two patients experienced a second CNSL relapse due to ponatinib reduction, but they achieved CNSR again after an increase to the standard dosage. Six patients developed graft versus host disease. By April 1, 2019, eight patients were alive, and one died of pneumonia. The median time of survival after the first CNSL relapse posttransplantation was 18 (range: 11.2-48.5) months.

However, cancer registry (CR) data are usually made available with substantial delay to ensure best possible completeness of case ascertainment. Here, we investigate empirically with routinely available data whether such a delay is mandatory for survival analyses or whether data can be used earlier to provide more up-to-date survival estimates. We compared distributions of prognostic factors and period relative survival estimates for three population-based CRs in Germany (Schleswig-Holstein (SH), Rhineland-Palatinate (RP), Saarland (SA)) computed on datasets extracted one (DY+1) to 5 years after the year of diagnosis (DY+5; reference). Analyses were conducted for seven cancer sites and various survival analyses scenarios. The proportion of patients registered in the datasets at a given time varied strongly across registries with 57% (SH), 2% (RP) and 26% (SA) registered in DY+1 and >93% in all registries in DY+3. Five-year survival estimates for the most recent three-year period were comparable to estimates from the reference dataset already in DY+1 (mean absolute deviations = 0.2-0.6% units). Deviations >1% units were only observed for pancreatic and lung cancer in RP and leukemia in SA (all </=1.5% units). For estimates of 1-year survival based on the most recent 1-year period only, slightly longer delays were required, but reasonable estimates were still obtained after 1-2 years, depending on the CR and cancer site. Thus, progress in cancer survival could be disclosed in a more timely manner than commonly practiced despite delays in completeness of registration.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Compounds ABQ3, ABQ11, and ABQ12 demonstrated a pronounced antiproliferative effect against chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cell line with IC50 values of 0.82 +/- 0.07, 0.28 +/- 0.03, and 0.98 +/- 0.22 muM, respectively. Among them, ABQ11 showed approximately three times higher selectivity than imatinib on CML. ABQ11-treated CML cells induced significant apoptosis at low concentration. Inhibitory effect of ABQ11 against eight different tyrosine kinases, including ABL1, was investigated. ABQ11 inhibited ABL1 with IC50 value of 13.12 +/- 1.71 muM, indicating that the moderate inhibition of ABL1 kinase is just an in-part mechanism of its outstanding cellular activity. Molecular docking of ABQ11 into ABL1 kinase ATP-binding pocket revealed the formation of some key interactions. Furthermore, DNA cleavage assay showed that ABQ11 strongly disintegrated DNA at 1 muM concentration in the presence of iron (II) complex system, assuming that the major mechanism for the anticancer effects of ABQ11 is DNA cleavage. In silico ADMET prediction revealed that ABQ11 is a drug-like small molecule with a favorable safety profile.

Hyponatremia has been associated with a worse outcome in several pathologies, including cancer, in which the leading cause of this electrolyte alteration is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. The aim of this study was to analyze in vitro the effects of low extracellular [Na(+)] in cancer progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a previously validated experimental model of chronic hyponatremia to characterize the effects of low extracellular [Na(+)] in different human cancer cell lines: pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PANC-1), neuroblastoma (SK-N-AS, SH-SY5Y), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HCT-8), chronic myeloid leukemia (K562). RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a direct relationship between low [Na(+)], reduced cell adhesion and increased invasion and proliferation in all cell lines tested. Accordingly, the number of tumor colonies grown in soft agar and the expression of collagenases type IV (metalloproteinases 2 and 9) were markedly higher in cancer cells exposed to reduced extracellular [Na(+)]. Gene analysis showed an upregulation of molecular pathways involved in oxidative stress (heme oxygenase 1) and in proliferation and invasion (RhoA, ROCK-1, ROCK-2). The activation of RhoA/ROCK pathway was paralleled by a deregulation of the cytoskeleton-associated proteins, resulting in the promotion of actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate for the first time that low [Na(+)] promotes cancer progression in vitro, thus suggesting that hyponatremia is not a simple bystander of disease severity in cancer.",,"['Marroncini, Giada', 'Fibbi, Benedetta', 'Errico, Alice', 'Grappone, Cecilia', 'Maggi, Mario', 'Peri, Alessandro']","['Marroncini G', 'Fibbi B', 'Errico A', 'Grappone C', 'Maggi M', 'Peri A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6417-434X'],"['Pituitary Diseases and Sodium Alterations Unit, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Endocrinology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Pituitary Diseases and Sodium Alterations Unit, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Endocrinology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Pituitary Diseases and Sodium Alterations Unit, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Endocrinology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Gastroenterology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Endocrinology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy.', 'Pituitary Diseases and Sodium Alterations Unit, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy. alessandro.peri@unifi.it.', 'Endocrinology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, AOU Careggi, 50139, Florence, Italy. alessandro.peri@unifi.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191129,United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,['9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)'],IM,"['*Adenocarcinoma', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', '*Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Sodium']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Carcinogenesis', '*Gene expression', '*Human cancer cells', '*Low sodium [Na+]', '*Tumor invasion']",2019/12/01 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2019/12/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/12/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12020-019-02135-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12020-019-02135-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrine. 2020 Feb;67(2):473-484. doi: 10.1007/s12020-019-02135-0.

The CQDs display blue fluorescence with excitation/emission maxima at 370/440 nm. It is shown that the array can be applied to the determination of all natural amino acids (NAAs). Metal ions can quench the fluorescence of the CQDs, while NAAs can take metal ions away or co-bind to the CQD@metal-ion complex, which enhances or depresses the fluorescence of the CQDs. Based on the differential fluorescence variation, the CQD@metal-ion@NAA array exhibits a unique pattern for NAAs. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were carried out to generate visualized datagrams for NAA discrimination. The design and construction of the sensor array is convenient and economical. The sensor array can distinguish NAAs at a concentration of as low as 30 muM, and can distinguish NAAs into acidic, neutral and basic NAAs. Semi-quantitative assay of alanine and threonine was also realized.

Here, we assessed the value of genomic capture high-throughput sequencing (gc-HTS) in BCP ALL (n = 183) for the identification and implementation of targets for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing. For TRdelta, a total of 300 clonal rearrangements were detected in 158 of 183 samples (86%). Beside clonal Vdelta2-Ddelta3, Ddelta2-Ddelta3, and Vdelta2-Jalpha we identified a novel group of recurrent Ddelta-Jalpha rearrangements, comprising Ddelta2 or Ddelta3 segments fused predominantly to Jalpha29. For IGH-JH, 329 clonal rearrangements were identified in 172 of 183 samples (94%) including novel types of V(D)J joining. Oligoclonality was found in ~1/3 (n = 57/183) of ALL samples.

A distinct MRD high-risk subgroup of IGH-V(D)J-germline ALL revealed frequent deletions of IKZF1 (n = 7/11) and the presence of genomic fusions (n = 10/11). Quantitative measurement using genomic fusion breakpoints achieved equivalent results compared to conventional V(D)J-based MRD testing and could be advantageous upon persistence of a leukemic clone.

METHODS: English-speaking children, 4.0-17.99 years old and undergoing ALL maintenance treatment with an English-speaking guardian, were eligible to participate in this observational, serial, cross-sectional feasibility study. Data were collected from participants over one to three 7-day periods during months 2-3, 5-6 and 11-12 of ALL maintenance treatment. A future trial was considered feasible if the mean time to enrol 10 patients in each of three data collection periods was </=1 year with >/=80% of patients returning evaluable data. CINV control was described as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 31 consenting patients (median age: 6.5 years, IQR: 5.1-9.2) completed the study: 10 in months 2-3, 10 in months 5-6 and 9 in months 11-12. The total time to recruit 29 patients was 1.2 years. In each of the three data collections periods, 72% of the patients provided evaluable data. Complete CINV control was reported in 6/21 (29%) evaluable study periods. CONCLUSIONS: A future trial to evaluate interventions to improve CINV control in patients with ALL undergoing oral maintenance chemotherapy as designed in this study is not feasible. An electronic data capture method and deferring patient recruitment until the mid-maintenance to late-maintenance phase should be considered in the design of a future trial.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9/NRAS(G12V) murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes ""LSC-specific"" genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69(High) LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36(High) LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings define and functionally validate a self-renewal gene profile of leukemia stem cells at the single-cell level and demonstrate that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in AML.

Vertical transmission of BLV occurs via in utero infection and ingestion of infected milk and colostrum. The aim of this study was to clarify whether milk is a risk factor in BLV transmission by quantifying proviral loads in milk and visualizing the infectivity of milk. We collected blood and milk from 48 dams (46 BLV seropositive dams and 2 seronegative dams) from seven farms in Japan and detected the BLV provirus in 43 blood samples (89.6%) but only 22 milk samples (45.8%) using BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2. Although the proviral loads in the milk tended to be lower, a positive correlation was firstly found between the proviral loads with blood and milk. Furthermore, the infectivity of milk cells with BLV was visualized ex vivo using a luminescence syncytium induction assay (LuSIA) based on CC81-GREMG cells, which form syncytia expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in response to BLV Tax and Env expressions when co-cultured with BLV-infected cells. Interestingly, in addition to one BLV-infected dam with lymphoma, syncytia with EGFP fluorescence were observed in milk cells from six BLV-infected, but healthy, dams by an improved LuSIA, which was optimized for milk cells. This is the first report demonstrating the infectious capacity of cells in milk from BLV-infected dams by visualization of BLV infection ex vivo.

In patients with cancer, it is important to evaluate the risk of chemical coping when using opioids. There are some pediatric opioid use-related tolerances and addictions; however, no mention of chemical coping has been found. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of an 11-year-old Japanese boy with acute lymphocytic leukemia. After transplantation, he complained of abdominal and articular pain, which are considered as symptoms of graft-versus-host disease; thus, opioid therapy was initiated, and the dose was gradually increased for pain management, resulting in a high dose of 2700 mug/day of fentanyl (4200-4700 mug/day including the rescue dose). After switching from fentanyl to oxycodone injections, he continued to experience pain, and there was no change in the frequency of oxycodone rescue doses. Physically, his pain was considered to have alleviated; thus, there was the possibility of mental anxiety resulting in the lowering of pain threshold and the possibility of chemical coping. Mental anxiety and stress with progress through schooling was believed to have resulted in chemical coping; thus, efforts were made to reduce the boy's anxiety, and opioid education was provided. However, dose reduction was challenging. Ultimately, with guidance from medical care providers, the opioid dose was reduced, and the patient was successfully weaned off opioids.

Indeed innate and adaptive immunity are strongly intertwined each other during evolution. The complexity is further increased by intrinsic mechanisms of immunity that rely on the action of intracellular molecules defined as restriction factors (RFs) that, particularly in virus infections, counteract the action of pathogen gene products acting at different steps of virus life cycle. MAIN BODY AND CONCLUSION: Here we provide an overview on the nature and the mode of action of restriction factors involved in retrovirus infection, particularly Human T Leukemia/Lymphoma Virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection. As it has been extensively studied by our group, special emphasis is given to the involvement of the MHC class II transactivator CIITA discovered in our laboratory as regulator of adaptive immunity and subsequently as restriction factor against HIV-1 and HTLV-1, a unique example of dual function linking adaptive and intrinsic immunity during evolution. We describe the multiple molecular mechanisms through which CIITA exerts its restriction on retroviruses. Of relevance, we review the unprecedented findings pointing to a concerted action of several restriction factors such as CIITA, TRIM22 and TRIM19/PML in synergizing against retroviral replication. Finally, as CIITA profoundly affects HTLV-1 replication by interacting and inhibiting the function of HTLV-1 Tax-1 molecule, the major viral product associated to the virus oncogenicity, we also put forward the hypothesis of CIITA as counteractor of HTLV-1-mediated cancer initiation.",,"['Forlani, Greta', 'Shallak, Mariam', 'Ramia, Elise', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Accolla, Roberto S']","['Forlani G', 'Shallak M', 'Ramia E', 'Tedeschi A', 'Accolla RS']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2493-7378'],"['Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Via Ottorino Rossi 9, 21100, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Via Ottorino Rossi 9, 21100, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Via Ottorino Rossi 9, 21100, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Via Ottorino Rossi 9, 21100, Varese, Italy.', 'Laboratories of General Pathology and Immunology ""Giovanna Tosi"", Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Via Ottorino Rossi 9, 21100, Varese, Italy. roberto.accolla@uninsubria.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191129,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/virology', 'Lymphoma/virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*immunology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/immunology/virology', 'Trans-Activators/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",PMC6884849,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CIITA', '*HIV', '*HTLV-1', '*Intrinsic immunity', '*Restriction factors', '*Tax']",2019/12/01 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/12/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0498-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0498-6 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Nov 29;16(1):34. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0498-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemokines play fundamental roles in the onset, progression cellular, migration, survival and improvement of AML therapy outcomes. The CCR5 receptors together with their ligands have indirect effects on the progression of cancer. In the present study, we have decided to investigate the impact of chemotherapy on the expression of CCR5 and its related ligands (CCL5, CCL4 and CCL3). MAIN METHODS: In this study, peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens were collected prior and post the first stage of (7 + 3) chemotherapy from 25 AML-M4/M5 patients. The expression of CCR by Lymphocytes in peripheral blood was examined by flow cytometry and QRT-PCR. The serum levels of chemokines were measured by ELISA. KEY FINDINGS: There was not observed leukemic blast cells in peripheral blood smear at post first stage of chemotherapy. We found that the expression of CCR5 was attenuated in patients post the first stage of chemotherapy and the healthy control subjects. We have also observed that the serum levels of chemokines were elevated in AML patients prior to chemotherapy. Although in post-chemotherapy stage, only CCL3 was found to reach to the baseline level, CCL5 and CCL4 have not returned to the basal level and were significantly higher than healthy control subjects. SIGNIFICANCE: The current chemotherapy protocol was not able to completely inhibit CCL5 and CCL4. In conclusion, our findings in harmony with previous studies suggest that inhibition of chemokines along with chemotherapy in AML patients may aid therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, drugs targeting specific biochemical pathways critical for B-NHL cell survival, proliferation, and fitness within the malignant microenvironment are now available to the clinician: the B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors of BTK, PI3Kdelta, zeta, gamma, and SYK or the pro-apoptotic BH3-mimetics are clear examples of it. Moreover, it is emerging that malignant B-cell growth is sustained not only by mutations in oncogenes/tumor suppressors but also by the ""addiction"" to nononcogene (ie, nonstructurally altered) molecules. In this regard, a consistent body of data has established that the Ser/Thr kinases CK1, CK2, and GSK3 are involved in malignant lymphocyte biology and act as pro-survival and signaling-boosting molecules, both in precursor and mature B-cell tumors. Currently, an experimental and clinical groundwork is available, upon which to design CK1-, CK2-, and GSK3-directed antilymphoma/leukemia therapies. In this review, we have examined the main features of CK1, CK2, and GSK3 kinases, summarized the data in B-NHL supporting them as suitable therapeutic targets, and proposed a perspective on potential future research development.","['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Piazza, Francesco', 'Manni, Sabrina', 'Arjomand, Arash', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro']","['Piazza F', 'Manni S', 'Arjomand A', 'Visentin A', 'Trentin L', 'Semenzato G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2831-623X'],"['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematological Malignancies - Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Foundation for Advanced Biomedical Research - Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (FABR-VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematological Malignancies - Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Foundation for Advanced Biomedical Research - Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (FABR-VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematological Malignancies - Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Foundation for Advanced Biomedical Research - Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (FABR-VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematological Malignancies - Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Foundation for Advanced Biomedical Research - Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (FABR-VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematological Malignancies - Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Foundation for Advanced Biomedical Research - Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (FABR-VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematological Malignancies - Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Foundation for Advanced Biomedical Research - Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (FABR-VIMM), Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['IG18387 to Francesco Piazza/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', '(AIRC)']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191201,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytes', 'CK1', 'CK2', 'GSK3', 'lymphoma', 'protein kinase']",2019/11/30 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2694 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;38(1):3-11. doi: 10.1002/hon.2694.

Almost always it is observed after chemotherapy or radiotherapy initiation, but rarely occurs spontaneously. CASE REPORT A 89-year-old female with stable chronic lymphocytic leukemia was admitted to the hospital because of worsening dyspnea and dry cough. Her vital signs were normal, except for sinus tachycardia. On physical examination, she appeared distressed, dyspneic, sweaty but afebrile, anxious, but alert and well oriented. Lung examination revealed reduced air entry with bibasilar crackles. No peripheral edema was seen, pulses were normal, and no signs of deep vein thrombosis were observed. Laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis; but normal hematological and biochemical parameters. Intravenous (IV) furosemide and antibiotics (IV ceftriaxone and orally azithromycin) were started along with steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 62.5 mg, IV). The treatment with steroids lasted for 1 day only, and in the following day, the patient was switched to prednisone (20 mg/day orally) for only 1 additional day. White blood cell count increased on day 1, 2 and 3 after admission, along development of hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure and elevated troponin levels. Hemodiafiltration/hemodialysis was initiated, and the patient was discharged after serum concentrations of these electrolytes and kidney function were restored. One month after discharge, the patient denied any malaise and was at stable condition.

While current concepts of cancer immunology and immunotherapy have relevance, there are also unique aspects of immune dysregulation in AML to be considered when designing rational immunotherapy for this leukaemia. This is timely because rapid advances in cancer immunobiology, together with technological developments have opened up the field of immunotherapy for malignant disease.

SUMMARY ANSWER: AMH concentrations and FD do not correlate in young women, and AMH but not FD is reduced in some diseases, limiting the value of AMH as a predictive parameter of ovarian tissue transplantation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: AMH is widely used as a parameter to estimate the ovarian reserve. However, the reliability of AMH to predict total number of follicles and the FD is questionable. Women with lymphoma and leukaemia have been shown to have reduced AMH concentrations, but it is unknown if the FD is also reduced. In fertility preservation it is essential to estimate the correct total number of follicles and the FD, as ovarian tissue should only be cryopreserved if ovarian reserve is high. Furthermore, the amount of tissue to be transplanted should be based on the estimation of the real FD. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective observational study included 830 women (mean +/- SD age, 28.2 +/- 6.81 years; range, 4-43 years) with malignant (n = 806) and benign (n = 24) diseases who cryopreserved tissue in a single centre as part of a national fertility preservation programme. Females with ovarian surgery or known predispositions for a reduced ovarian reserve were excluded. AMH concentrations and FD were evaluated from March 2011 to September 2016. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: AMH concentrations were analysed before gonadotoxic therapies. Standardized biopsies, obtained from different areas of ovarian cortex, were collected. FD was analysed after tissue digestion and calcein staining and was expressed as average number of primordial and primary follicles count per 3 mm biopsy and per cubic millimeter tissue. AMH concentrations and FD were analysed in relation to age and diagnosis group. Both parameters were age adjusted, and associations between the different diagnosis groups and AMH versus FD were assessed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Mean +/- SD AMH concentration was 3.1 +/- 2.81 g/ml, mean FD per 3 mm biopsy was 137 +/- 173.9 and 19.4 +/- 24.60 per mm3. Maximum AMH concentrations were found in children and teenagers at the age of 6-10 years (5.71 ng/ml) and in adults at the age of 21-25 years (3.33 ng/ml). FD was highest in young children up to an age of 15 years and decreased with increasing age. AMH and FD were not correlated in women </=20 years and weakly to moderately correlated in women 21-40 years (r = 0.24-0.39). Age-adjusted correlations between AMH and FD were demonstrated in several diagnosis groups such as breast cancer, leukaemia, sarcoma, gastrointestinal cancer and gynaecological cancer but not in the groups exhibiting Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cerebral cancer, other types of malignancies and other types of benign diseases. Further statistical analysis supported the finding that, in some diagnosis groups such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and in gynaecological cancer, AMH concentrations but not FDs are reduced, questioning the prognostic accuracy of AMH for the FD in these diseases. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Even though biopsies were taken from different sites, heterogenous distribution of follicles might have had some effect on the accuracy of the analysis. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: AMH should be used with care to estimate the total ovarian reserve and FD of cancer patients in young women in some diseases. Therefore, calculating the amount of ovarian tissue to be transplanted based solely on AMH might be inaccurate whereas FD might be a better parameter. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study did not receive any exterior funding.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Endothelial protective strategies, such as defibrotide (DF), may be useful in this scenario. We evaluated changes induced by CKD on endothelial cell proteome and explored the effect of DF and the mechanisms involved. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were exposed to sera from healthy donors (n = 20) and patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (n = 20). Differential protein expression was investigated by using a proteomic approach, Western blot and immunofluorescence. HDAC1 and HDAC2 overexpression was detected. Increased HDAC1 expression occurred at both cytoplasm and nucleus. These effects were dose-dependently inhibited by DF. Both the HDACs inhibitor trichostatin A and DF prevented the up-regulation of the endothelial dysfunction markers induced by the uraemic milieu: intercellular adhesion molecule-1, surface Toll-like receptor-4, von Willebrand Factor and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, DF down-regulated HDACs expression through the PI3/AKT signalling pathway. HDACs appear as key modulators of the CKD-induced endothelial dysfunction as specific blockade by trichostatin A or by DF prevents endothelial dysfunction responses to the CKD insult. Moreover, DF exerts its endothelial protective effect by inhibiting HDAC up-regulation likely through PI3K/AKT.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 13-year prospective cohort study of patients with spontaneous HCV clearance was conducted in a tertiary care centre. Baseline characteristics, incident cardiovascular and neurologic events and cancers were analysed. RESULTS: Of 104 consecutive patients (mean age: 54.08 years old; females: 71 [68%]), 37 (34.6%) had MC and 6 (5.8%) had cirrhosis. MC (+) patients were more female (86% vs 58%, P = .002), had higher rate of cirrhosis (14% vs 1.5%, P = .012), higher levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG; P = .001), IgM (P = .002) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) (P = .004), but lower levels of complement C4 (P = .034) than the MC (-) patients. Female gender (95% confidence interval [CI] of odds ratio: 1.402-26.715), levels of IgG (1.000-1.004), IgM (1.009-1.037) and FIB-4 (1.217-3.966) were independently associated with MC. Baseline rheumatoid factor (RF) levels were independently associated with incident cancer (95% CI hazard ratio [HR]: 1.001-1.030 [HR: 1.015], P = .039). With a cut-off value of 11.3 IU/mL, RF levels significantly predicted incident cancer (area under curve: 0.865, P = .002).

CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1/3 of patients with spontaneous HCV clearance yielded MC, which harboured similar characteristics of MC in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

The aim of this study was to evaluate information about oral care for leukemia patients and quality of information related to videos available on YouTube. METHOD AND MATERIALS: In this cross-sectional study, YouTube videos were analyzed according to the information content. The search was performed in English and using the search term: leukemia/oral care. The following information was registered: date of upload, source of upload, duration, total views, number of likes, number of dislikes, number of comments, overall quality. The overall quality of videos was assessed using the following quality criteria presented in the Global Quality Scale (GQS): poor, generally poor, moderate, good, and excellent. In addition, videos were classified as useful, misleading, and patient personal experience. Videos were assessed in terms of definition, etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, treatment, and oral care for leukemia. RESULTS: Sixty-three videos (78.8%) were classified as useful, 6 (7.5%) as misleading and 11 (13.8%) as a patient's personal experience. Thirteen videos (16.3%) discussed the definition of leukemia, 8 (10.0%) discussed etiology, 6 (7.5%) discussed pathogenesis, 7 (8.8%) discussed symptoms of leukemia, 50 (62.5%) discussed treatment choices, and 15 videos (18.8%) discussed oral care of leukemia. Thirteen videos (16.3%) were assessed as poor, 17 (21.3%) as generally poor, 39 (48.8%) as moderate, 10 (12.5%) as good quality, and 1 (1.3%) as excellent. There was a significant difference between the content of videos and the number of views, number of likes, number of dislikes, and number of comments (P < .05). There was a significant difference between the content of videos and number of views, number of likes, number of dislikes, and number of comments (P = .007, P = .006, P = .049, and P = .011 respectively).

Methods: Fifty-four AML patients were participated in this study and randomly allocated to either the test group or a control group. The patients of the test group received NS oil mouth rinse during 28-day CT, while the participants of the control group received a ""magic mouthwash"" formula. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence and severity of CT-induced OM in terms of erythema and ulcer. The secondary outcomes were the pain severity score, swallowing function, and the salivary concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Results: NS oil mouth rinse attenuated the progression of CT-induced OM compared with the control formula (AUC = 5.9 vs. 38.4, P < 0.05) and significantly decreased the erythema and ulceration scores (AUC of total OMAS = 11.4 vs. 85.9, P < 0.001) compared with the magic mouthwash formula. It also reduced the pain score and enabled all the participants of this group to consume normal food during treatment. It significantly decreased salivary IL-6 (AUC = 7376 vs. 16599, P < 0.001), while the changes of TNF-alpha levels were not significant (AUC = 676.9 vs. 885.2, P > 0.05).

Despite significant improvements in understanding the genomic landscape and the introduction of novel drugs, long-term outcome remains unsatisfactory. Recently, immunotherapeutic approaches have heralded a new era in cancer treatment. The success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in AML highlights the disease's immunoresponsiveness. Several immunotherapeutic applications are currently under clinical evaluation and include immune checkpoint blockades, T cell-engaging antibodies, and genetically engineered T cells. However, immunoevasive mechanisms employed by AML blasts severely hamper our endeavors. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains a prerequisite for improving treatment efficacy. One of the hallmarks of the cancer cells is metabolic reprogramming, introduced by Otto Warburg's seminal studies during the beginnings of the last century. Nowadays, it is well established that metabolic adaptation is not just an epiphenomenon during oncogenesis but rather a necessity for tumor development and progression. Furthermore, accumulating data suggest an important role of aberrant tumor cell metabolism for immune escape. AML blasts display a number of metabolic alterations that could be linked to immunoregulation, and these include competition over substrates, abundant release of bioactive metabolites, and an overall microenvironmental metabolic re-modeling that favors the induction or survival of immunoregulatory cell subsets such as regulatory T cells. In this review, we outline the immunoevasive character of the AML blasts' bioenergetics, set it into context with oncogenic mutations, and discuss potentially suitable countermeasures and their limitations.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Mougiakakos.'],"['Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']",['Mougiakakos D'],,"['Department of Medicine 5, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191106,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6851227,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunoescape mechanisms', 'immunotherapy', 'microenvironment', 'tumor metabolism']",2019/11/30 06:00,2019/11/30 06:01,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01166 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Nov 6;9:1166. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01166. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The successful deployment of unselected adoptive cell therapy established AML as a disease responsive to immunomodulation. Classification systems for AML have been refined and expanded over the years in an effort to capture the variability of this heterogeneous disease and risk-stratify patients. Current systems increasingly incorporate information about cytogenetic alterations and genetic mutations. The advent of next generation sequencing technology has enabled the comprehensive identification of recurrent genetic mutations, many with predictive power. Recurrent genetic mutations found in AML have been intensely studied from a cell intrinsic perspective leading to the genesis of multiple, recently approved targeted therapies including IDH1/2-mutant inhibitors and FLT3-ITD/-TKD inhibitors. However, there is a paucity of data on the effects of these targeted agents on the leukemia microenvironment, including the immune system. Recently, the phenomenal success of checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells has re-ignited interest in understanding the mechanisms leading to immune dysregulation and suppression in leukemia, with the objective of harnessing the power of the immune system via novel immunotherapeutics. A paradigm has emerged that places crosstalk with the immune system at the crux of any effective therapy. Ongoing research will reveal how AML genetics inform the composition of the immune microenvironment paving the way for personalized immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Mendez, Posey and Pandolfi.']","['Mendez, Lourdes M', 'Posey, Ryan R', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Mendez LM', 'Posey RR', 'Pandolfi PP']",,"['Department of Medicine and Pathology, Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine and Pathology, Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine and Pathology, Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Ludwig Center at Harvard, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191107,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6856667,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'genetics', 'immune landscape', 'immunotherapy', 'metabolism', 'targeted (selective) treatment']",2019/11/30 06:00,2019/11/30 06:01,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01162 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Nov 7;9:1162. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01162. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel class of long non-coding RNA with a stable circular conformation that regulates various biological processes. The aberrant expression of circRNA and its impact on AML progression has been reported by a number of studies. Despite recent advances in circRNA research, our understanding of the leukemogenic mechanism of circRNA remains very limited, and translating the current circRNA-related research into clinical practice is challenging. This review provides an update on the functional roles of and research progress on circRNAs in AML with an emphasis on mechanistic insights. The challenges and opportunities associated with circRNA-based diagonostic and therapeutic development in AML are also outlined.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Jamal, Song, Chen, Faisal, Hong, Xie, Wu, Pan, Yin, Shao and', 'Zhang.']","['Jamal, Muhammad', 'Song, Tianbao', 'Chen, Bei', 'Faisal, Muhammad', 'Hong, Zixi', 'Xie, Tian', 'Wu, Yingjie', 'Pan, Shan', 'Yin, Qian', 'Shao, Liang', 'Zhang, Qiuping']","['Jamal M', 'Song T', 'Chen B', 'Faisal M', 'Hong Z', 'Xie T', 'Wu Y', 'Pan S', 'Yin Q', 'Shao L', 'Zhang Q']",,"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Developmentally Originated Disease, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191106,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6851197,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'apoptosis', 'biomarker', 'cell proliferation', 'circular RNA (circRNA)', 'drug resistance', 'targeted therapy']",2019/11/30 06:00,2019/11/30 06:01,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01108 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Nov 6;9:1108. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01108. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection can lead to two main symptomatologies: adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Each manifestation is associated with distinct characteristics, as ATLL presents as a leukemia-like disease, while HAM/TSP presents as severe inflammation in the central nervous system, leading to paraparesis. Previous studies have identified molecules associated with disease development, e.g., the downregulation of Foxp3 in Treg cells was associated with increased risk of HAM/TSP. In addition, elevated levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, and Neopterin in cerebrospinal fluid also present increased risk. However, these molecules were only associated with specific patient groups or viral strains. Furthermore, the majority of studies did not jointly compare all clinical manifestations, and robust analysis entails the inclusion of both ATLL and HAM/TSP. The low numbers of samples also pose difficulties in conducting gene expression analysis to identify specific molecular relationships. To address these limitations and increase the power of manifestation-specific gene associations, meta-analysis was performed using publicly available gene expression data. The application of supervised learning techniques identified alterations in two genes observed to act in tandem as potential biomarkers: GBP2 was associated with HAM/TSP, and CD40LG with ATLL. Together, both molecules demonstrated high sample-classification accuracy (AUC values: 0.88 and 1.0, respectively). Next, other genes with expression correlated to these genes were identified, and we attempted to relate the enriched pathways identified with the characteristic of each clinical manifestation. The present findings contribute to knowledge surrounding viral progression and suggest a potentially powerful new tool for the molecular classification of HTLV-associated diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Fukutani, Ramos, Kasprzykowski, Azevedo, Rodrigues, Lima,', 'Araujo Junior, Fukutani and Queiroz.']","['Fukutani, Eduardo Rocha', 'Ramos, Pablo Ivan Pereira', 'Kasprzykowski, Jose Irahe', 'Azevedo, Lucas Gentil', 'Rodrigues, Moreno Magalhaes de Souza', 'Lima, Joao Victor de Oliveira Pimenta', 'de Araujo Junior, Helton Fabio Santos', 'Fukutani, Kiyoshi Ferreira', 'de Queiroz, Artur Trancoso Lopo']","['Fukutani ER', 'Ramos PIP', 'Kasprzykowski JI', 'Azevedo LG', 'Rodrigues MMS', 'Lima JVOP', 'de Araujo Junior HFS', 'Fukutani KF', 'de Queiroz ATL']",,"['Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Analise e Visualizacao de Dados, FIOCRUZ-RO, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Jose Silveira, Multinational Organization Network Sponsoring Translational and Epidemiological Research, FJS, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Faculdade de Tecnologia e Ciencias, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, FIOCRUZ, Salvador, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191108,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC6857459,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis', 'adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia', 'bioinformatics', 'biomarkers', 'human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'meta-analysis']",2019/11/30 06:00,2019/11/30 06:01,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2019.01056 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2019 Nov 8;10:1056. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2019.01056. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapeutic approaches are changing the current landscape in MM with B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) as one of the most promising target antigens. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting BCMA produced unprecedented results in heavily pretreated relapsed and/or refractory MM. Data on more than 300 MM patients treated with anti-BCMA directed CAR T cells are available and these numbers are rapidly increasing. The response rate and the depth of responses induced by anti-BCMA CAR T cells are impressive; however, the majority of patients eventually relapse. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of response and resistance in treated MM patients will be critical to the rational development of this therapy. Moreover, the ideal place of this therapy in the treatment paradigm for MM is an important question that needs biological and clinical correlative data to help elucidate. T-cell-related, tumor-related and microenvironmental factors may play a role in the efficacy of anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy.

In AML, the use of drugs in combination often delivers superior clinical activity. To identify genes and cellular pathways that collaborate with LSD1 to maintain the leukaemic phenotype, and which could be targeted by combination therapies, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screen. We identified multiple components of the amino acid sensing arm of mTORC1 signalling-RRAGA, MLST8, WDR24 and LAMTOR2-as cellular sensitizers to LSD1 inhibition. Knockdown of mTORC1 components, or mTORC1 pharmacologic inhibition, in combination with LSD1 inhibition enhanced differentiation in both cell line and primary cell settings, in vitro and in vivo, and substantially reduced the frequency of clonogenic primary human AML cells in a modelled minimal residual disease setting. Synergistic upregulation of a set of transcription factor genes associated with terminal monocytic lineage differentiation was observed. Thus, dual mTORC1 and LSD1 inhibition represents a candidate combination approach for enhanced differentiation in MLL-translocated AML which could be evaluated in early phase clinical trials.",,"['Deb, Gauri', 'Wingelhofer, Bettina', 'Amaral, Fabio M R', 'Maiques-Diaz, Alba', 'Chadwick, John A', 'Spencer, Gary J', 'Williams, Emma L', 'Leong, Hui-Sun', 'Maes, Tamara', 'Somervaille, Tim C P']","['Deb G', 'Wingelhofer B', 'Amaral FMR', 'Maiques-Diaz A', 'Chadwick JA', 'Spencer GJ', 'Williams EL', 'Leong HS', 'Maes T', 'Somervaille TCP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9188-4379'],"['Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Computational Biology Support, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Oryzon Genomics S.A., Carrer Sant Ferran 74, Cornella de Llobregat, 08940, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Oglesby Cancer Research Centre Building, 555 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK. tim.somervaille@cruk.manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['A18083/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C147/A25254/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C5759/A20971/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191128,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antidepressive Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '3E3V44J4Z9 (Tranylcypromine)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Everolimus/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tranylcypromine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7192845,['EMS84958'],,,2019/11/30 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0659-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0659-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 May;34(5):1266-1277. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0659-6.

A surrogate endpoint that can more rapidly predict survival could accelerate drug development. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) status as a valid progression-free survival (PFS) surrogate in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched abstracts in PubMed, The American Society of Hematology, and the European Hematology Association for ""myeloma,"" ""minimal residual disease,"" and ""clinical trial."" Because of the need to evaluate the treatment effect on MRD response, only randomized studies for subjects with NDMM were included. Details on the MRD-tested populations were required. The meta-analysis was performed by principles outlined at the 2013 United States Food and Drug Administration workshop on MRD in acute myeloid leukemia.(42) For samples that were not measured for MRD and within the subset specified for MRD assessment, their MRD status was imputed from the samples that had known MRD status. Patients that were excluded from planned MRD assessment were considered MRD-positive. RESULTS: Six randomized studies, representing 3283 patients and 2208 MRD samples, met analysis inclusion criteria. MRD negativity rates ranged from 0.06 to 0.70. The treatment effect on the odds ratio for MRD-negative response strongly correlated with the hazard ratio for PFS with a coefficient of determination for the weighted regression line of 0.97. Our meta-analysis suggested that MRD status met both the Prentice criteria for PFS surrogacy. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the claim that MRD status can be used as a surrogate for PFS in NDMM.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

The combination of 7-day cytarabine and an anthracycline on days 1-3 (the so called ""7+3"" regimen) can be considered standard of care of younger patients with AML. However, the treatment of the elderly ineligible for intensive chemotherapy remains a challenge. Low-dose of subcutaneous cytarabine or hypomethylating agents (HMA) have been studied this group. There are no studies investigating physician practice variation in treating AML in Brazil. METHODS: We developed a survey with ten questions in order to explore the approach to AML in Brazil. RESULTS: The sample size comprised 100 hematologists. Most reported regular (63%) or occasional (29%) treatment of AML patients. Karyotype analysis and polymerase chain reaction were available in 88% and 71% of institutions, respectively. Next generation sequencing analysis was used in 7% of instituitions. Younger patients receive the ""7+3"" protocol with continuous infusion of cytarabine and anthracycline in 98% of cases. The preferred anthracycline is daunorubicin (64%), followed by idarubicin (34%). The most prescribed daunorubicin dose was 60mg/m(2) (56%). Consolidation after CR with high cytarabine doses (HIDAC) was indicated by 84% of hematologists and 70% use 3g/m(2) twice a day for 3 days. Elderly and unfit patients received HMA (47%) as the preferred treatment. CONCLUSION: We showed that the most prevalent AML treatments were according to current guidelines. There is room to improve on the availability of diagnostic tools and the capacity to perform bone marrow transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

However, without effective post-remission therapy, most patients will relapse. The extent to which post-remission therapies is individualized in the current paradigm is quite varied. Core binding factor (CBF) AML is typically treated with post-remission high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas those with intermediate or adverse-risk cytogenetics are treated with post-remission cytarabine followed by allogeneic HSCT in CR1 when feasible. A lack of clarity regarding the proper dosing of post-remission cytarabine has made consensus building on dosing and schedule a challenge. CBF AML benefits most from high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC), and dasatinib appears promising as an adjunct for those for KIT-mutated CBF AML. Other than series using CPX-351 or lomustine in older adults, multiagent chemotherapy approaches have resulted in excess toxicity without a survival benefit. Neither hypomethylating agents nor gemtuzumab ozogamicin have shown a material OS benefit. Targeted agents such as FLT3 inhibitors and IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors show potential for the patients who harbor these druggable targets, but few data are available.

The majority of patients respond to treatment, but those with resistant phenotypes suffer relapse or death. The antifolate methotrexate (MTX) is the most commonly used drug against ALL due to its efficacy. Once inside leukemic cells, MTX is metabolized into methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX-PG) by action of the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), leading to a longer action compared to that of MTX alone. Materials and Methods: In this work, we demonstrated that the combination treatment of methotrexate and 5 and 10 mM glutamic acid could enhance methotrexate cytotoxicity in CCRF-SB (B-ALL) cells. In addition, MTX plus 20 mM glutamic acid was able to improve the synthesis of MTX-PG5. Results: All treatments induced an increase in FPGS expression compared to that of the control group. Furthermore, we detected different cellular expression patterns of FPGS in the different treatments. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we demonstrated that levels of methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) could be a key determinant of methotrexate-induced cytotoxicity in CCRF-SB acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.",,"['Mendoza-Santiago, Alma', 'Becerra, Edgardo', 'Garay, Edith', 'Bah, Moustapha', 'Berumen-Segura, Laura', 'Escobar-Cabrera, Jesica', 'Hernandez-Perez, Abigail', 'Garcia-Alcocer, Guadalupe']","['Mendoza-Santiago A', 'Becerra E', 'Garay E', 'Bah M', 'Berumen-Segura L', 'Escobar-Cabrera J', 'Hernandez-Perez A', 'Garcia-Alcocer G']",,"['Unidad de Investigacion Genetica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, Centro Universitario, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Genetica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, Centro Universitario, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Neurobiologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, 04510 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion en Productos Naturales, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Genetica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, Centro Universitario, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Genetica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, Centro Universitario, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion en Productos Naturales, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Genetica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, Centro Universitario, 76010 Queretaro, Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191126,Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects', 'Glutamic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",PMC6956105,,['NOTNLM'],"['cytotoxicity', 'methotrexate', 'polyglutamates', 'polyglutamation']",2019/11/30 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['medicina55120758 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina55120758 [doi]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2019 Nov 26;55(12). pii: medicina55120758. doi: 10.3390/medicina55120758.,"['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

A plentitude of durable complete responses using CD19-specific CAR-T cells in patients suffering from various lymphoid malignancies resulted in the approval by the food and drug administration (FDA) of CD19-directed CAR-T cells for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A substantial portion of this success in hematological malignancies can be traced back to the beneficial properties of the target antigen CD19, which combines a universal presence on target cells with no detectable expression on indispensable host cells. Hence, to replicate response rates achieved in ALL and DLBCL in the realm of solid tumors, where ideal target antigens are scant and CAR-T cells are still lagging behind expectations, the quest for appropriate target antigens represents a crucial task to expedite the next steps in the evolution of CAR-T-cell therapy. In this review, we want to highlight the potential of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) as a CAR-target antigen for a variety of different cancer entities. In particular, we discuss merits and challenges associated with CSPG4-CAR-T cells for the ATT of melanoma, leukemia, glioblastoma, and triple-negative breast cancer.",,"['Harrer, Dennis C', 'Dorrie, Jan', 'Schaft, Niels']","['Harrer DC', 'Dorrie J', 'Schaft N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3478-0741', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8236-9298']","['Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],['trilateral grant SCHA 1247/3-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191126,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (CSPG4 protein, human)', '0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6928974,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T cell', 'CSPG4', 'glioblastoma', 'leukemia', 'melanoma', 'target antigen', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",2019/11/30 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/11/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20235942 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20235942 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Nov 26;20(23). pii: ijms20235942. doi: 10.3390/ijms20235942.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory tests that use a cell counter or a flow cytometer can perform a complete blood count (CBC) rapidly. Nonetheless, a manual blood smear inspection is still needed, both to have a human check on the counter results and to monitor patients under therapy. Moreover, it allows for describing the cells' appearance as well as any abnormalities. However, manual analysis is lengthy and repetitive, and its result can be subjective and error-prone. In contrast, by using image processing techniques, the proposed system is entirely automated. The main effort is devoted to both achieving high accuracy and finding a way to overcome the typical differences in the condition of blood smear images that computer-aided methods encounter. It is based on the Edge Boxes method, which is considered a state-of-art region proposal approach. By incorporating knowledge-based constraints into the detection process using Edge Boxes, we can find cell proposals rapidly and efficiently. We tested the proposed approach on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Image Database (ALL-IDB), a well-known public dataset proposed for leukaemia detection, and the Malaria Parasite Image Database (MP-IDB), a recently proposed dataset for malaria detection. Experimental results were excellent in both cases, outperforming the state-of-the-art on ALL-IDB and creating a strong baseline on MP-IDB, demonstrating that the proposed method can work well on different datasets and different types of images.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study addressed the possibility of FLT3 modulating nucleoside salvage processes and, eventually, cytarabine action. Bone marrow samples from 108 pediatric leukemia patients (B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BCP-ALL: 83; T-ALL: 9; acute myeloid leukemia, AML: 16) were used to determine the mRNA expression levels of FLT3, the cytarabine activating kinase dCK, and the nucleotidases cN-II and SAMHD1. FLT3 mRNA levels positively correlated with dCK, cN-II and SAMHD1 in the studied cohort. FLT3 inhibition using AC220 promoted the expression of cN-II in MV4-11 cells. Indeed, inhibition of cN-II with anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AdiS) further potentiated the synergistic action of AC220 and cytarabine, at low concentrations of this nucleoside analog. FLT3 inhibition also down-regulated phosphorylated forms of SAMHD1 in MV4-11 and SEM cells. Thus, inhibition of FLT3 may also target the biochemical machinery associated with nucleoside salvage, which may modulate the ability of nucleoside-derived drugs. In summary, this contribution highlights the need to expand current knowledge on the mechanistic events linking tyrosine-kinase receptors, likely to be druggable in cancer treatment, and nucleotide metabolism, particularly considering tumor cells undergo profound metabolic reprogramming.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is no report on any correlation of eIF3b gene expression with cell proliferation and apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the role of eIF3b in cell proliferation and apoptosis in CML. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from patients with CML and CML cell lines were used. Quantitative RT-PCR, siRNA transfection, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis were performed. RESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression of eIF3b mRNA in CML patients was higher than that in the non-malignant controls. The proliferation of CML cells decreased after transfection of the cells with siRNA. The proportion of cells in the G1 and S phases in the experimental group decreased after transfection, while the number of cells in the G2/M phase increased, as compared with the control group. The total cell apoptosis percentage in the sheIF3b group (transduction with lentivirus-anti-eIF3b in K562 cells) was higher than the shCtrl group (transduction with empty-vector lentivirus in K562 cells) after transfection. Caspase 3/7 activity was higher and the expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 was lower in the sheIF3b group than in the shCtrl group after transfection.

These chlorinated nucleobases are formed in vivo, particularly in chronic inflammatory pathologies, which are characterized by the overproduction of HOCl by myeloperoxidase. As such, chlorinated nucleosides are used as biomarkers of inflammation. However, these compounds have also attracted attention as potential chemotherapeutic agents with 8-chloro-adenosine (8ClA), for example, currently in clinical trials for the treatment of hematological cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 8ClA has mainly RNA-directed effects in malignant cells, with exposure resulting in ATP depletion and apoptotic cell death. Whether 8ClA has significant reactivity with nonmalignant cells has not been widely studied. Here we show that prolonged incubation of J774A.1 macrophage-like cells with 8ClA results in the perturbation of cellular metabolism and apoptotic cell death. These effects are associated with an accumulation of 8-chloroadenosine triphosphate (8Cl-ATP), an effect not seen in experiments utilizing other chlorinated nucleosides. Exposure of the macrophages to 8ClA did not significantly change basal mitochondrial respiration or glycolysis but resulted in an increase in maximal mitochondrial respiration as well as spare respiratory capacity within these cells. Additionally, 8ClA exposure also altered the mRNA expression of a range of antioxidant and DNA damage repair genes in the macrophages in a manner consistent with a reduction in the capacity of the cells to cope with oxidative stress and repair DNA damage. Taken together, these results provide new insight into pathways by which the production of HOCl during chronic inflammation could perturb immune cell function and may also have implications for the use of 8ClA as a chemotherapeutic drug.",,"['Macer-Wright, Jessica L', 'Sileikaite, Inga', 'Rayner, Benjamin S', 'Hawkins, Clare L']","['Macer-Wright JL', 'Sileikaite I', 'Rayner BS', 'Hawkins CL']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2738-5089'],"['The Heart Research Institute , 7 Eliza Street , Newtown , New South Wales 2042 , Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales 2006 , Australia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences , University of Copenhagen , Panum, Blegdamsvej 3B , Copenhagen N, DK-2200 , Denmark.', 'The Heart Research Institute , 7 Eliza Street , Newtown , New South Wales 2042 , Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales 2006 , Australia.', 'The Heart Research Institute , 7 Eliza Street , Newtown , New South Wales 2042 , Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales 2006 , Australia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences , University of Copenhagen , Panum, Blegdamsvej 3B , Copenhagen N, DK-2200 , Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191216,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice']",,,,,2019/11/30 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2019/11/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00334 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2020 Feb 17;33(2):402-413. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00334.

Several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as key regulators of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation. However, the function and regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs during the initiation of ESC differentiation remains unclear. Here, we found that linc1557 was highly expressed in mouse ESCs and required for the initiation of ESC differentiation. Knockdown of linc1557 increased the expression and phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a key factor in the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that linc1557 directly bound to Stat3 mRNA and affected its stability. The differentially expressed transcriptome after linc1557 knockdown in ESCs was involved primarily in multicellular organism development and cell differentiation as similar to that after Stat3 knockdown. Moreover, either knockdown of Stat3 or addition of a LIF/STAT3 signaling inhibitor rescued the suppressive effects of linc1557 knockdown on the initiation of mouse ESC differentiation. These findings not only elucidated the critical function of linc1557 in the initiation of mouse ESC differentiation but also clarified that its specific mechanism as directly affecting Stat3 mRNA stability, which enhanced the understanding of the lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for mRNA stability and key signaling pathways in ESC pluripotency and differentiation.",['(c)AlphaMed Press 2019.'],"['Lan, Yuanyuan', 'Lu, Chenqi', 'Yang, Yiwei', 'Liu, Xiaoqin', 'Guo, Xudong', 'Xi, Jiajie', 'Kang, Jiuhong', 'Wang, Guiying']","['Lan Y', 'Lu C', 'Yang Y', 'Liu X', 'Guo X', 'Xi J', 'Kang J', 'Wang G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7538-1889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0361-8127']","[""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Signaling and Disease Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191217,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['* Linc1557', '*STAT3', '*differentiation initiation', '*embryonic stem cells', '*mRNA stability']",2019/11/30 06:00,2021/04/21 06:00,['2019/11/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3130 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2020 Mar;38(3):340-351. doi: 10.1002/stem.3130.

We tested whether in the *14 and *15 alleles of SLCO1B1 influenced the response to low-dose MTX in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. Methods: The study included 310 JIA patients genotyped for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLCO1B1 (rs4149056, rs2306283, and rs11045819). A patient's SLCO1B1 diplotype was determined by combining the SNPs into the *1a, *1b, *4, *5, *14, and *15 alleles. Number of active joints at follow-up (visit closest to 6 months of treatment and prior to starting a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) was used as the dependent variable in a negative binomial regression model that included active joint count at baseline as a covariate. Results: The SLCO1B1*14 allele was associated with less response to MTX (P = 0.024) and the *15 allele was not associated with response to MTX (P = 0.392). Conclusion: SLCO1B1 alleles may be associated with poor response to MTX in JIA patients. The *14 allele has been associated with fast clearance (low exposure) after high-dose MTX in patients with leukemia. Thus, the SLCO1B1 gene may be informative for precision dosing of MTX in JIA patients. Patients carrying the *14 allele may require a higher dose than noncarriers to achieve a similar response to MTX.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

NPM1-mutated AML patients are correlated with higher extramedullary involvement. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the key steps which cause distant metastasis in tumor. However, whether EMT-related programs contribute to cell invasion in NPM1-mutated AML remains unclear. In this study, we identified the EMT-related gene versican (VCAN) in NPM1-mutated AML across three patient datasets. Further experiments validated the elevated VCAN expression in NPM1-mutated AML primary blasts and OCI-AML3 cells with NPM1 mutation. Mechanistic studies revealed that increased VCAN expression was at least partially regulated by NPM1 mutant via TGF-beta/cPML/Smad signalling. Functional evaluations showed that silencing VCAN by shRNA significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion capacity, whereas increased VCAN by overexpressing NPM1-mA enhanced migration and invasion ability of leukemia cells. Finally, we found that high expression of VCAN was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. These findings provide insights into the involvement of EMT-related gene VCAN in the pathogenesis of NPM1-mutated leukemia, which suggests that VCAN is an attractive target for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in NPM1-mutated AML.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Yang, Liyuan', 'Wang, Lu', 'Yang, Zailin', 'Jin, Hongjun', 'Zou, Qin', 'Zhan, Qian', 'Tang, Yuting', 'Tao, Yao', 'Lei, Li', 'Jing, Yipei', 'Jiang, Xueke', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Yang L', 'Wang L', 'Yang Z', 'Jin H', 'Zou Q', 'Zhan Q', 'Tang Y', 'Tao Y', 'Lei L', 'Jing Y', 'Jiang X', 'Zhang L']",,"['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191021,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC6856892,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell invasion', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'gene mutation', 'nucleophosmin', 'versican']",2019/11/30 06:00,2019/11/30 06:01,['2019/11/29 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.30223 [doi]', 'jcav10p6570 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2019 Oct 21;10(26):6570-6583. doi: 10.7150/jca.30223. eCollection 2019.,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the immunological factors associated with severe influenza infection, the immune responses in mice infected with nonlethal (LD0) doses of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus were compared with those of mice infected with a lethal dose (LD100) of the virus. The virus titer and activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptor signaling pathways were similar in the mice infected with LD0 and LD100 at 2 days post-infection; however, mice infected with LD100 exhibited a greater abundance of cytokines and a more diverse cytokine profile. Infection with LD100 induced the expression of the following factors: Interleukins (ILs), IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12p40, IL-13 and IL-15; inflammatory chemokines, C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)2, CCL3/4, CCL12, CCL17, CCL19; and lung injury-associated cytokines, leptin, leukaemia inhibitory factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, pentraxin (PTX)2 and PTX3, WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-3, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain. Switching in macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 was evidenced by the increase in M2 markers, including arginase-1 (Arg1) and early growth response protein 2 (Egr2), in the lungs of mice infected with LD100. Since IL-12 and interferon-gamma are the major T helper (Th)1 cytokines, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor 4, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 promoted the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into Th2 cells.

Many treatments have comparable efficacy making their impact on quality of life (QoL) an important differentiating factor. In this review, we discuss QoL in older adults with AML, focusing on therapeutic and observational trials that have incorporated QoL assessments. RECENT FINDINGS: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a multi-dimensional concept incorporating physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning domains. HRQoL components overlap with components of geriatric assessment, a multidisciplinary diagnostic process that identifies underlying vulnerabilities of older adults and guides subsequent management strategies. HRQoL questionnaires may be general, cancer-specific, leukemia-specific, or symptom-focused. Therapeutic and observational cohort studies suggest HRQoL improves, or at least remains stable, during intensive and lower-intensity therapies.

Gain-of-function mutations of MyD88 constitutively activate downstream NF-kappaB signaling pathways, resulting in increased cellular proliferation and survival. However, whether MyD88 activity can be aberrantly regulated in MyD88-wild-type lymphoid malignancies remains poorly understood. SPOP is an adaptor protein of CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and frequently mutated genes in prostate and endometrial cancers. In this study, we reveal that SPOP binds to and induces the nondegradative ubiquitination of MyD88 by recognizing an atypical SPOP-binding motif in MyD88. This modification blocks Myddosome assembly and downstream NF-kappaB activation. SPOP is mutated in a subset of lymphoid malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Lymphoid malignancies-associated SPOP mutants exhibited impaired binding to MyD88 and suppression of NF-kappaB activation. The DLBCL-associated, SPOP-binding defective mutants of MyD88 escaped from SPOP-mediated ubiquitination, and their effect on NF-kappaB activation is stronger than that of wild-type MyD88. Moreover, SPOP suppresses DLBCL cell growth in vitro and tumor xenograft in vivo by inhibiting the MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling. Therefore, SPOP acts as a tumor suppressor in DLBCL. Mutations in the SPOP-MyD88 binding interface may disrupt the SPOP-MyD88 regulatory axis and promote aberrant MyD88/NF-kappaB activation and cell growth in DLCBL.",,"['Jin, Xiaofeng', 'Shi, Qing',

Age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH/CHIP) is a frequent finding in the elderly and combinations with MPN driver mutations (JAK2, MPL, and CALR) have been described. To determine the impact of ARCH/CHIP-related mutations for development of fibrosis in primary myelofibrosis (PMF), the mutational status of cases with fibrotic progression from grade 0 to grade 2/3 (n = 77) as evidenced by follow-up bone marrow biopsies (median 6.2 years) was compared with prefibrotic PMF samples without development of fibrosis (n = 27; median follow-up 7.3 years). Frequent ARCH/CHIP-associated mutations (TET2, ASXL1, and DNMT3A) demonstrable at presentation were not connected with fibrotic progression. However, mutations which are rarely found in ARCH/CHIP (SRSF2, U2AF1, SF3B1, IDH1/2, and EZH2) were present in 24.7% of cases with later development of fibrosis and not detectable in cases staying free from fibrosis (P = 0.0028). Determination of the tumor mutational burden (TMB) in a subgroup of cases (n = 32) did not show significant differences (7.68 mutations/MB vs. 6.85 mutations/MB).

The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone consistently induces BoHV-1 reactivation from latency. Expression of four Kruppel-like transcription factors (KLF), i.e., KLF4, KLF6, PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger), and KLF15, are induced in TG neurons early during dexamethasone-induced reactivation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and KLF15 form a feed-forward transcription loop that cooperatively transactivates the BoHV-1 immediate early transcription unit 1 (IEtu1) promoter that drives bovine infected cell protein 0 (bICP0) and bICP4 expression. Since the bICP0 gene also contains a separate early (E) promoter, we tested the hypothesis that GR and KLF family members transactivate the bICP0 E promoter. GR and KLF4, both pioneer transcription factors, cooperated to stimulate bICP0 E promoter activity in a ligand-independent manner in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A). Furthermore, GR and KLF4 stimulated productive infection. Mutating both half GR binding sites did not significantly reduce GR- and KLF4-mediated transactivation of the bICP0 E promoter, suggesting that a novel mechanism exists for transactivation. GR and KLF15 cooperatively stimulated bICP0 activity less efficiently than GR and KL4: however, KLF6, PLZF, and GR had little effect on the bICP0 E promoter. GR, KLF4, and KLF15 occupied bICP0 E promoter sequences in transfected Neuro-2A cells. GR and KLF15, but not KLF4, occupied the bICP0 E promoter at late times during productive infection of bovine cells. Collectively, these studies suggest that cooperative transactivation of the bICP0 E promoter by two pioneer transcription factors (GR and KLF4) correlates with stimulating lytic cycle viral gene expression following stressful stimuli.IMPORTANCE Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), an important bovine pathogen, establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons. Reactivation from latency is consistently induced by the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone. We predict that increased corticosteroid levels activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Consequently, viral gene expression is stimulated by the activated GR. The immediate early transcription unit 1 promoter (IEtu1) drives expression of two viral transcriptional regulatory proteins, bovine infected cell protein 0 (bICP0) and bICP4. Interestingly, a separate early promoter also drives bICP0 expression. Two pioneer transcription factors, GR and Kruppel-like transcription factor 4 (KLF4), cooperatively transactivate the bICP0 early (E) promoter. GR and KLF15 cooperate to stimulate bICP0 E promoter activity but significantly less than GR and KLF4. The bICP0 E promoter contains enhancer-like domains necessary for GR- and KLF4-mediated transactivation that are distinct from those for GR and KLF15. Stress-induced pioneer transcription factors are proposed to activate key viral promoters, including the bICP0 E promoter, during early stages of reactivation from latency.",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['El-Mayet, Fouad S', 'Sawant, Laximan', 'Thunuguntla, Prasanth', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Jones, Clinton']","['El-Mayet FS', 'Sawant L', 'Thunuguntla P', 'Zhao J', 'Jones C']",,"['Oklahoma State University, Center for Veterinary Health Sciences, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University, Center for Veterinary Health Sciences, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University, Center for Veterinary Health Sciences, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University, Center for Veterinary Health Sciences, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Oklahoma State University, Center for Veterinary Health Sciences, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA clint.jones10@okstate.edu.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103648/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS102290/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200131,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Klf15 protein, mouse)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (bICP0 protein, Bovine herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/genetics', 'Herpesviridae Infections/metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 4/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/virology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Activation/genetics']",PMC6997752,,['NOTNLM'],"['*bovine herpesvirus 1', '*gene expression', '*pioneer transcription factor', '*stress response']",2019/11/30 06:00,2020/08/22 06:00,['2019/11/29 06:00'],"['2019/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01670-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01670-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2020 Jan 31;94(4). pii: JVI.01670-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01670-19.

Here we present extensive molecular analysis of this unusual transformation, including immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement studies, cytogenetic analysis, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the patient's FL, B-ALL/LBL, and normal cells. Although FL showed marked somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the Ig genes, SHM appeared to be even more extensive in B-ALL/LBL. Cytogenetically, at least three translocations were identified in the B-ALL/LBL involving the BCL2, BCL6, and MYC genes; two of these, the BCL6 and BCL2 gene rearrangements, were already seen at the FL stage. WES identified 751 single-nucleotide variants with high allelic burden in the patient's cells, with the vast majority (575) present exclusively at the B-ALL/LBL stage. Of note, a TAF3 gene mutation was shared by normal, FL, and B-ALL/LBL tissue. A KMT2D nonsense mutation was identified in both FL and B-ALL/LBL and therefore may have contributed directly to lymphomagenesis. Mutations in KDM6A, SMARCA4, CBX1, and JMY were specific to the B-ALL/LBL stage, possibly contributing to the B-ALL/LBL transformation. Functionally, these identified mutations may lead to dysregulation of DNA repair, transcription, and cell differentiation. Thus, these genetic changes, together with the identified chromosomal translocations, may have contributed to lymphoma development and progression.

Previously, only small studies investigated clinical and imaging features of MS. The purpose of this study was to elucidate clinical and imaging features of MS based upon a multicenter patient sample. METHODS: Patient records of radiological databases of 4 German university hospitals were retrospectively screened for MS in the time period 01/2001 and 06/2019. Overall, 151 cases/76 females (50.3%) with a mean age of 55.5 +/- 15.1 years and 183 histopathological confirmation or clinically suspicious lesions of MS were included into this study. The underlying hematological disease, localizations, and clinical symptoms as well as imaging features on CT and MRI were investigated. RESULTS: In 15 patients (9.9% of all 151 cases) the manifestation of MS preceded the systemic hematological disease. In 43 cases (28.4%), first presentation of MS occurred simultaneously with the initial diagnosis of leukemia, and 92 (60.9%) patients presented MS after the initial diagnosis. In 37 patients (24.5%), the diagnosis was made incidentally by imaging. Clinically, cutaneous lesions were detected in 35 of 151 cases (23.2%). Other leading symptoms were pain (n = 28/151, 18.5%), neurological deficit (n = 27/151, 17.9%), swelling (n = 14/151, 9.3%) and dysfunction of the affected organ (n = 10/151, 6.0%). Most commonly, skin was affected (n = 30/151, 16.6%), followed by bone (n = 29/151, 16.0%) and lymphatic tissue (n = 21/151, 11.4%). Other localizations were rare. On CT, most lesions were homogenous. On T2-weighted imaging, most of the lesions were hyperintense. On T1-weighted images, MS was hypointense in n = 22/54 (40.7%) and isointense in n = 30/54 (55.6%). A diffusion restriction was identified in most cases with a mean ADC value of 0.76 +/- 0.19 x 10(- 3) mm(2)/s. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows clinical and imaging features of MS based upon a large patient sample in a multicenter design. MS occurs in most cases meta-chronous to the hematological disease and most commonly affects the cutis. One fourth of cases were identified incidentally on imaging, which needs awareness of the radiologists for possible diagnosis of MS.",,"['Meyer, Hans-Jonas', 'Ponisch, Wolfram', 'Schmidt, Stefan Andreas', 'Wienbeck, Susanne', 'Braulke, Friederike', 'Schramm, Dominik', 'Surov, Alexey']","['Meyer HJ', 'Ponisch W', 'Schmidt SA', 'Wienbeck S', 'Braulke F', 'Schramm D', 'Surov A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8489-706X'],"['Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University of Leipzig, University Hospital Leipzig, Liebigstrasse 20, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.

We performed a longitudinal follow-up study using a nationwide cohort to assess the risk of lymphoid neoplasms arising after herpes zoster infection in the adult Korean population. METHODS: Data from participants >/=20 years of age who were registered in the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database between 2002 and 2013 were collected. We extracted the data of participants with herpes zoster (n = 59,495) as well as those of matched references at a ratio of 1:4 (n = 237,980) and investigated the subsequent occurrence of lymphoid neoplasms. A stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) as well as those adjusted for the Charlson comorbidity index score. RESULTS: The rate of lymphoid neoplasms was higher in the herpes zoster group (0.15% [90/59,495]) than in the reference group (0.08% [212/237,980], P < 0.001). The unadjusted and adjusted HRs of herpes zoster in patients with lymphoid neoplasms were 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31-2.15) and 1.58 (95% CI = 1.23-2.02), respectively (P < 0.001 for both). On subgroup analyses according to age and sex, herpes zoster was associated with an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms in all subgroups; the adjusted HRs were 1.53 (95% CI = 1.05-2.24) for patients < 60 years old, 1.58 (95% CI = 1.14-2.20) for patients >/=60 years old, 1.64 (95% CI = 1.16-2.31) for men, and 1.51 (95% CI = 1.06-2.16) for women (P < 0.05 for all). On subgroup analysis of lymphoid neoplasm subtypes, herpes zoster was associated with the risk of Hodgkin's disease (adjusted HR: 3.23 [95% CI = 1.17-8.93]) and multiple myeloma/malignant plasma cell neoplasms (adjusted HR: 2.17 [95% CI = 1.33-3.54]) (P < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster is associated with lymphoid neoplasm development in the Korean population irrespective of age and sex. The risks of Hodgkin's disease and plasma cell neoplasms are significantly elevated in patients with herpes zoster.",,"['Choi, Hyo Geun', 'Zehnder, James L', 'Lee, Young Kyung', 'Lim, Hyun', 'Kim, Miyoung']","['Choi HG', 'Zehnder JL', 'Lee YK', 'Lim H', 'Kim M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8903-5044'],"['Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Republic of Korea. rabbit790622@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, 22, Gwanpyeong-ro 170 beon-gil, Dongan-gu, Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, 14068, South Korea. rabbit790622@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191127,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herpes Zoster/*complications/virology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6882027,,['NOTNLM'],"['Herpes zoster', 'Korea', 'Lymphoma', 'Risk']",2019/11/30 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2019/11/29 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6349-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6349-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Nov 27;19(1):1148. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6349-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, PCM patients join survivors of other malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer with a relatively new clinical problem - second primary malignancies (SPMs) - many of which are a result of the treatment of the initial cancer. PCM patients have a statistically significant increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Kaposi sarcoma. IMiD treatment has also been associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), AML, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. However, within these overlapping groups, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is much less common. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we describe an elderly man with PCM and a 14-year cumulative history of IMiD therapy who developed persistent pancytopenia and was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). He joins a group of 17 other patients documented in the literature who have followed a similar sequence of events starting with worsening cytopenias while on IMiD maintenance for PCM. These PCM patients were diagnosed with B-ALL after a median time of 36 months after starting IMiD therapy and at a median age of 61.5 years old. CONCLUSIONS: PCM patients with subsequent B-ALL have a poorer prognosis than their de novo B-ALL counterparts, however, the very low prevalence rate of subsequent B-ALL and high efficacy of IMiD maintenance therapy in PCM should not alter physicians' current practice. Instead, there should be a low threshold for bone marrow biopsy for unexplained cytopenias.",,"['Sinit, Ryan B', 'Hwang, Dick G', 'Vishnu, Prakash', 'Peterson, Jess F', 'Aboulafia, David M']","['Sinit RB', 'Hwang DG', 'Vishnu P', 'Peterson JF', 'Aboulafia DM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6752-3530'],"['Floyd and Delores Jones Cancer Institute, Virginia Mason Medical Center, 1100 Ninth Avenue (C2-HEM), Seattle, WA, 98101, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Floyd and Delores Jones Cancer Institute, Virginia Mason Medical Center, 1100 Ninth Avenue (C2-HEM), Seattle, WA, 98101, USA.

FASN plays a critical role in supporting tumor cell growth, thus representing a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. Moreover, this enzyme has been recently associated with increased PD-L1 expression, suggesting a role for fatty acids in the impairment of the immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Orlistat, a tetrahydrolipstatin used for the treatment of obesity, has been reported to reduce FASN activity, while inducing a sensible reduction of the growth potential in different cancer models. We have analyzed the effect of orlistat on different features involved in the tumor cell biology of the T-ALL Jurkat cell line. In particular, we have observed that orlistat inhibits Jurkat cell growth and induces a perturbation of cell cycle along with a decline of FASN activity and protein levels. Moreover, the drug produces a remarkable impairment of PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that orlistat interferes with different mechanisms involved in the control of tumor cell growth and can potentially contribute to decrease the tumor-associated immune-pathogenesis.",,"['Cioccoloni, Giorgia', 'Aquino, Angelo', 'Notarnicola, Maria', 'Caruso, Maria Gabriella', 'Bonmassar, Enzo', 'Zonfrillo, Manuela', 'Caporali, Simona', 'Faraoni, Isabella', 'Villiva, Cristina', 'Fuggetta, Maria Pia', 'Franzese, Ornella']","['Cioccoloni G', 'Aquino A', 'Notarnicola M', 'Caruso MG', 'Bonmassar E', 'Zonfrillo M', 'Caporali S', 'Faraoni I', 'Villiva C', 'Fuggetta MP', 'Franzese O']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6457-2380'],"['Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Nutritional Biochemistry, National Institute for Digestive Diseases S. de Bellis, Bari, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Nutritional Biochemistry, National Institute for Digestive Diseases S. de Bellis, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, IDI-IRCCS Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191128,England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '95M8R751W8 (Orlistat)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (FASN protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.85 (Fatty Acid Synthase, Type I)']",IM,"['B7-H1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acid Synthase, Type I/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Orlistat/*pharmacology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['FASN', 'PD-L1', 'leukemia']",2019/11/30 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/11/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1120009X.2019.1694761 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 2020 Feb;32(1):30-40. doi: 10.1080/1120009X.2019.1694761.

Methods: From June 2016 to November 2018, we collected 373 newly diagnosed APL cases. The patients were retrospected by the results of PML-RARalpha detections both by RT-PCR and i-FISH, those who harbored positive PML-RARalpha detection by RT-PCR and negative by i-FISH were chosen. Metaphase FISH and Sanger sequencing were further performed to verify these results. Results: A total of 7 cryptic APL cases were discovered. These cases had tiny fragment of RARalpha inserted into PML in chromosome 15, formed ins (15;17) . The 7 cryptic APL cases had no PML-RARalpha gene subtype specificity, involving 5 cases in L subtype, 1 case in S subtype and 1 case in V subtype respectively. After the treatment of retinoic acid and arsenic or anthracyclines, 6 cases achieved complete remission, 1 case died of intracranial hemorrhage on the 6th day of therapy. Conclusion: The size and covering position of PML-RARalpha probe should be taken into account when PML-RARalpha was performed by FISH on APL patients. Furthermore, combination with Metaphase FISH could improve the recognition of cryptic APL.

IL-1beta is a key cytokine in the course of both acute and chronic inflammatory responses, making it indispensable for protection of the host, but also linking it to several diseases. Thus, IL-1beta signaling must be tightly regulated. As suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins effectively control immune responses, we investigated the role of SOCS2 in IL-1beta-induced DC activation. Human monocyte-derived DCs were stimulated with IL-1beta, and SOCS2 mRNA and protein levels were measured. DC activation was assessed by cytokine secretion and surface marker expression. For functional analysis, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based SOCS2 silencing was performed. SOCS2 expression was also analyzed in a curated NCBI GEO dataset of myeloid leukemia patients. We found IL-1beta to be a potent inducer of SOCS2 expression. By silencing SOCS2, we showed that SOCS2 specifically limits IL-1beta-induced IL-8 secretion. Moreover, our analysis revealed that SOCS2 levels are significantly increased in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, two hematological malignancies where disease progression is closely linked to IL-1beta.

TDP2 is a logical target for the development of therapeutics to complement existing treatments based on inhibition of TOP2. There is, however, no TDP2 inhibitor in clinical development at present. Of the reported TDP2 inhibitors, the deazaflavins are the most promising chemical class centered around the lead compound SV-5-153. Recently we reported new subtypes derived within the deazaflavin family with improved membrane permeability properties. In this work we characterize two representative analogues from two new deazaflavin subtypes based on their biochemical TDP2 inhibitory potency and drug-likeness. We demonstrate that the ZW-1288 derivative represents a promising direction for the development of deazaflavins as therapeutic agents. ZW-1288 exhibits potent inhibitory activity at low nanomolar concentrations against recombinant and cellular human TDP2 with profile similar to that of the parent analog SV-5-153 based on high resistance against murine TDP2 and human TDP2 mutated at residue L313H.

Causal function of histone-modifying enzymes in this process remains to be defined. Here we show that inhibiting histone methyltransferase MLL1 reprograms naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to expanded pluripotent stem cells (EPSCs), with differentiation potential toward both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in vitro and in vivo. MLL1 inhibition or deletion upregulates gene signatures of early blastomere development. The function of MLL1 in restricting induction of EPSCs is mediated partly by Gc, which regulates cellular response to vitamin D signaling. Combined treatment of MLL1 inhibitor and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) cooperatively enhanced functionality of EPSCs, triggering an extended 2C-like state in vitro and robust totipotent-like property in vivo.

The primary objective of the Hemato-Oncology Latin America (HOLA) study was to describe patient characteristics and treatment patterns of Latin American patients with MM, CLL, and NHL. METHODS: This study was a multicenter, retrospective, medical chart review of patients with MM, CLL, and NHL in Latin America identified between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015. Included were adults with at least 1 year of follow-up (except in cases of death within 1 year of diagnosis) treated at 30 oncology hospitals (Argentina, 5; Brazil, 9; Chile, 1; Colombia, 5; Mexico, 6; Panama/Guatemala, 4). RESULTS: Of 5,140 patients, 2,967 (57.7%) had NHL, 1,518 (29.5%) MM, and 655 (12.7%) CLL. Median follow-up was 2.2 years for MM, 3.0 years for CLL, and 2.2 years for NHL, and approximately 26% died during the study observation period. Most patients had at least one comorbidity at diagnosis. The most frequent induction regimen was thalidomide-based chemotherapy for MM and chlorambucil with or without prednisone for CLL. Most patients with NHL had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 49.1%) or follicular lymphoma (FL; 19.5%). The majority of patients with DLBCL or FL received rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. CONCLUSION: The HOLA study generated an unprecedented level of high-quality, real-world evidence on characteristics and treatment patterns of patients with hematologic malignancies. Regional disparities in patient characteristics may reflect differences in ethnoracial identity and level of access to care. These data provide needed real-world evidence to understand the disease landscape in Latin America and may be used to inform clinical and health policy decision making.",,"['Tietsche de Moraes Hungria, Vania', 'Chiattone, Carlos', 'Pavlovsky, Miguel', 'Abenoza, Lina M', 'Agreda, Gladys P', 'Armenta, Jorge', 'Arrais, Celso', 'Avendano Flores, Oscar', 'Barroso, Fernando', 'Basquiera, Ana L', 'Cao, Carmen', 'Cugliari, Maria S', 'Enrico, Alicia', 'Foggliatto, Laura M', 'Galvez, Kenny M', 'Gomez, David', 'Gomez, Alvaro', 'de Iracema, Daniel', 'Farias, Danielle', 'Lopez, Lineth', 'Mantilla, William Armando', 'Martinez, Deborah', 'Mela, Maria Jose', 'Miguel, Carlos E', 'Ovilla, Roberto', 'Palmer, Luis', 'Pavlovsky, Carolina', 'Ramos, Christian', 'Remaggi, Guillermina', 'Santucci, Rodrigo', 'Schusterschitz, Sergio', 'Sossa, Claudia Lucia', 'Tuna-Aguilar, Elena', 'Vela, Jorge', 'Santos, Telma', 'de la Mora, Odin', 'Machnicki, Gerardo', 'Fernandez, Mariana', 'Barreyro, Paula']","['Tietsche de Moraes Hungria V', 'Chiattone C', 'Pavlovsky M', 'Abenoza LM', 'Agreda GP', 'Armenta J', 'Arrais C', 'Avendano Flores O', 'Barroso F', 'Basquiera AL', 'Cao C', 'Cugliari MS', 'Enrico A', 'Foggliatto LM', 'Galvez KM', 'Gomez D', 'Gomez A', 'de Iracema D', 'Farias D', 'Lopez L', 'Mantilla WA', 'Martinez D', 'Mela MJ', 'Miguel CE', 'Ovilla R', 'Palmer L', 'Pavlovsky C', 'Ramos C', 'Remaggi G', 'Santucci R', 'Schusterschitz S', 'Sossa CL', 'Tuna-Aguilar E', 'Vela J', 'Santos T', 'de la Mora O', 'Machnicki G', 'Fernandez M', 'Barreyro P']",,"['Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas-Santa Casa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'FUNDALEU, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'ISSEMYM, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital Sirio-Libanes, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Medical Solution SA, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Hospital Universitario Walter Cantidio, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Hospital Privado Centro Medico de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina.', 'Instituto Nacional del Cancer, Santiago, Chile.', 'Instituto de Oncologia Angel H.

However, a female donor for a male recipient is a poor prognostic factor. The authors compared haploidentical (HAPLO) donors with female MSDs. METHODS: In total, 834 men underwent allogenic transplantation from a female MSD, and 232 men underwent allogenic transplantation from a HAPLO donor. Of these, 86% of HAPLO recipients and 3% of MSD recipients received graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis posttransplantation with high-dose cyclophosphamide. A significant qualitative interaction was observed between donor type and cytogenetics, Therefore, the analyses were stratified on cytogenetics. RESULTS: Of the men with intermediate-risk AML, 638 received transplantation from a female MSD, and 160 received transplantation from a HAPLO donor. In multivariate analysis, poor risk factors were a HAPLO donor versus an MSD for nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; P = .02) and patient age for nonrelapse mortality and overall survival (HR, 1.22 [P = .02] and 1.15 [P = .02], respectively). HAPLO transplantation resulted in less chronic GVHD (HR, 0.43; P < 10(-4) ) but lower leukemia-free survival (HR, 1.7; P = .04). The GVHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS) was not different. Of the men with high-risk AML, 196 received transplantation from a female MSD, and 72 received transplantation from a HAPLO donor. By multivariate analysis, HAPLO recipients had a lower incidence of relapse (HR, 0.40; P = .004), better leukemia-free survival (HR, 0.46; P = .003), better overall survival (HR, 0.43; P = .003), and better GRFS (HR, 0.54; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: In men who have intermediate-risk AML, allogenic transplantation from a sister MSD or a HAPLO donor produces similar GRFS. However, in men who have high-risk AML, a HAPLO donor combined with prophylactic high-dose cyclophosphamide posttransplantation may be a better choice.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'de Groot, Marco', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Gorin NC', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'de Groot M', 'Socie G', 'Bourhis JH', 'Ciceri F', 'Polge E', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0108-5769'],"['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM) Unit 938, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris APHP, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris Office, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM) Unit 938, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris APHP, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris Office, Paris, France.', 'Paoli Calmettes Institute, Aix Marseille University, Centre National de la Recherche scientifique, INSERM, CRCM, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM) Unit 938, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris APHP, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris Office, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM) Unit 938, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris APHP, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris Office, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20191127,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*statistics & numerical data', '*Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*haploidentical donors', '*matched sibling donors', '*stem cell transplantation']",2019/11/28 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32629 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Mar 1;126(5):1004-1015. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32629.

The syndrome consists of laboratory abnormalities either alone (laboratory TLS) or with clinical sequelae including renal failure, seizures, and arrhythmias (clinical TLS). Clinical TLS is a predictor for worse overall morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, but can be prevented. Thus, accurate prognostication is critical to appropriate management of patients at risk for TLS, and incorporates both disease factors (tumour type and burden) and patient factors (baseline renal insufficiency or hyperuricaemia). Strategies to prevent TLS include hydration and allopurinol in low- and intermediate-risk patients and rasburicase in high-risk patients.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Durani, Urshila', 'Hogan, William J']","['Durani U', 'Hogan WJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1860-2424', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5841-4105']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191127,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)'],IM,"['Allopurinol/*therapeutic use', '*Fluid Therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors', '*Tumor Lysis Syndrome/blood/mortality/therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*renal failure', '*tumor lysis syndrome']",2019/11/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16278 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Feb;188(4):494-500. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16278.

As a consequence, specific high-risk genetic features of the disease, e.g. TP53 disruption, have become the backbone of the treatment algorithm for CLL and serve as robust biomarkers for a precision medicine approach to this leukemia.Areas covered: This review covers the genetics of CLL and highlights the translational implications of molecular biomarkers that characterize patients with a high risk of disease progression. Knowledge of the genetic landscape of CLL has allowed the identification of the main molecular features associated with chemo-refractoriness, as well as resistance to BCR inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors. The molecular basis of Richter transformation has also been characterized.Expert opinion: The term 'high risk CLL' has been changing over time, and might be subject to further changes in the future. With the advent of new therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenetic pathways of the disease, the definition is shifting from the historical view of refractoriness to chemo-immunotherapy, to refractoriness to BCR inhibitors and/or to BCL2 inhibitors.

However, few well-characterized protein-turnover pathways have been identified because traditional methods to measure protein half-life are time and labor intensive. To overcome this barrier, we developed a protein stability probe and high-content screening pipeline for novel regulators of short half-life proteins using automated image analysis. Our pilot probe consists of the short half-life protein c-MYC (MYC) fused to Venus fluorescent protein (MYC-Venus). This probe enables protein half-life to be scored as a function of fluorescence intensity and distribution. Rapid turnover prevents maximal fluorescence of the probe due to the relatively longer maturation time of the fluorescent protein. Cells expressing the MYC-Venus probe were analyzed using a pipeline in which automated confocal microscopy and image analyses were used to score MYC-Venus stability by two strategies: assaying the percentage of cells with Venus fluorescence above background, and phenotypic comparative analysis. To evaluate this high-content screening pipeline and our probe, a kinase inhibitor library was screened by confocal microscopy to identify known and novel kinases that regulate MYC stability. Compounds identified were shown to increase the half-life of both MYC-Venus and endogenous MYC, validating the probe and pipeline. Fusion of another short half-life protein, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), with Venus also demonstrated an increase in percent Venus-positive cells after treatment with inhibitors known to stabilize MCL1. Together, the results validate the use of our automated microscopy and image analysis pipeline of stability probe-expressing cells to rapidly and quantitatively identify regulators of short half-life proteins.

The recommendations outlined in this paper are based on published evidence and expert opinion.

Moreover, the function of circ_0067934 was identified by performing proliferation assay, colony formation assay, cell cycle assay, and Ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay in vitro. Besides, the underlying mechanism was explored through Western blot assay and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: In this study, circ_0067934 expression was significantly higher in BC tissues when compared with that in adjacent non-tumor samples. Cell proliferation in BC was inhibited after knockdown of circ_0067934 in vitro. Moreover, cell cycle in BC was regulated after knockdown of circ_0067934 in vitro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles reporting the correlation between NAT2 polymorphisms and susceptibility of acute leukemia were searched from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. Citations in eligible articles were manually reviewed. Only cohort studies and case-control studies which provided odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the correlation between NAT2 polymorphisms and susceptibility of acute leukemia up to December 1st, 2018 were enrolled. The included data were weighted by an inverse variance and analyzed using the fixed-effects or random-effects model. The data acquisition and the heterogeneity test were conducted. STATA 12.0 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: This meta-analysis enrolled 10 independent case-control studies with 1,874 leukemia patients and 2,789 healthy volunteers. No significant difference was found between the fast-acetylator incidence of NAT2 haplotype and the onset risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.45-1.08) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML, OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.46-1.47). The subgroup analysis was conducted based on the sources of controls (SOCs). We did not find statistical difference in population-based (PB) group (OR=0.82, 95% CI=0.47-1.42) and hospital-based (HB) group (OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.27-1.08). In addition, the fast-acetylator incidence of NAT2 haplotype was only observed to be higher in ALL patients compared with HB group (OR=0.52, 95% CI=0.33-0.83), rather than the PB group (OR=0.82, 95% CI=0.47-1.44).

However, the expression of circRNAs in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely unknown so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve bone marrow samples from pediatric AML patients and healthy controls were analyzed using Agilent circRNA microarray (n = 6, respectively). The circRNAs profiles and regulatory networks were analyzed by integrated bioinformatics methods. Functional analysis (Gene Ontology and KEGG) was performed by KOBAS. The expression of circRNA in patient samples was validated via qRT-PCR assay (n > 30). Luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the binding of miRNAs. CCK8 and colony formation assay were conducted to measure cell proliferation. RESULTS: A total of 273 circRNAs were upregulated in AML and 296 were downregulated (Fold change > 2, p-value < 0.05), the majority of these circRNAs were distributed among chr1, chr6, and chr16, while few in chr13 and chr21. Top 20 differentially expressed circRNAs were chosen to build circRNAs-miRNAs regulatory relationships. Bioinformatics algorithms indicated that circ-0004136 acts as a sponge for several pediatric AML-related miRNAs. Target genes involved in the circ0004136-miRNA-mRNA network were enriched in leukemia-related functions and signaling pathways. Circ-0004136 was found to be significantly upregulated in pediatric AML and could sponge AML-related miRNAs, including miR-29a and miR-142. Furthermore, circ-0004136 was demonstrated to promote the proliferation of AML by sponging miR-142. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study revealed the circRNAs expression profile and regulatory networks of circRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs in pediatric AML for the first time.

We examined the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and pro-apoptotic activities of six ruthenium complexes containing amino acid with general formulation [Ru(AA)(bipy)(dppb)]PF6, where AA = amino acid (alanine, glycine, leucine, lysine, methionine, or tryptophan); bipy = 2,2 -bipyridine; and dppb = [1,4-bis(diphenylphosphine)butane], against A549 (lung carcinoma) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) cancer cells. The results show that the ruthenium complexes tested were able to induce cytotoxicity in A549 and K562 cancer cells. Complex 1 containing alanine inhibited the cell viability of A549 and K562 tumor cells by inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by an increased number of Annexin V-positive cells and the induction of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Complex 1 was able to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells through the mitochondrial dysfunction, the upregulation of apoptotic genes, and the downregulation of Bcl2 anti-apoptotic gene. Besides being cytotoxic to K562 and A549 cells, ruthenium complex containing alanine shows low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity against non-tumor cells.

However, because these agents are relatively ineffective, discovering other more effective drugs for AML treatment would be valuable. Methods: The in vitro antitumor effect of lenvatinib on AML cells was examined using the colorimetric MTT assay for assessing cell metabolic activity. AML cells mixed with Poloxamer 407 were injected into nude mice to form subcutaneous tumors. Tumor-bearing mice received lenvatinib by oral administration. The antitumor effect of lenvatinib was established by measuring tumor volumes and weights. Results: Lenvatinib inhibited the growth of AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. We used AML cells to establish subcutaneous tumor tissues by mixing the cell suspension with Poloxamer 407. Poloxamer 407 alone did not influence the subcutaneous growth of AML cells. Treatment of lenvatinib inhibited in vivo tumor growth of AML cells. Conclusion: The multiple-kinase inhibitor lenvatinib inhibits the in vitro proliferation of AML cells, and restricts the in vivo growth of AML tumors.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

In the advanced setting, MCC is often treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. X-ray radiation therapy (XRT) is commonly used for palliation. There is an unmet need for new treatment options in patients progressing on immunotherapy and XRT. We present 2 patients with progressive MCC who were successfully treated with high linear energy transfer neutron radiation therapy (NRT). Clinical Observations: Patient A, an 85-year-old white male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had progressive MCC with multiple tumors on the face despite prior XRT and ongoing treatment with pembrolizumab. The 5 most symptomatic lesions were treated with a short course of NRT (2 x 3 Gy) while continuing pembrolizumab. All irradiated facial lesions demonstrated a complete response 2 weeks after NRT. Remarkably, an additional 4 lesions located outside the NRT fields also completely resolved. Patient B, a 78-year-old white male with no immunosuppressive condition had recurrent MCC in the scalp and bilateral cervical nodes. The painful, ulcerative tumors on his scalp were progressing despite multiple courses of XRT and multiple immunotherapy regimens, including pembrolizumab. He was treated with NRT (16-18 Gy) to the scalp and had a complete response with successful palliation. While his disease subsequently progressed outside the NRT fields, the response to NRT bridged him to receive further investigational immunotherapies, and he remains disease free 3 years later. Conclusion: Short courses of high linear energy transfer particle therapy deserve consideration as a promising modality for local tumor control in XRT refractory tumors. The out-of-field response suggests that NRT has potential for synergizing with immunotherapy. While more data are required to identify optimal NRT parameters, the NRT dose that potentiates an antitumor immune response appears to be well below organ-at-risk tolerance.",['(c)Copyright 2018 International Journal of Particle Therapy.'],"['Schaub, Stephanie K', 'Stewart, Robert D', 'Sandison, George A', 'Arbuckle, Thomas', 'Liao, Jay J', 'Laramore, George E', 'Zeng, Jing', 'Rengan, Ramesh', 'Tseng, Yolanda D', 'Mayr, Nina A', 'Bhatia, Shailender', 'Nghiem, Paul T', 'Parvathaneni, Upendra']","['Schaub SK', 'Stewart RD', 'Sandison GA', 'Arbuckle T', 'Liao JJ', 'Laramore GE', 'Zeng J', 'Rengan R', 'Tseng YD', 'Mayr NA', 'Bhatia S', 'Nghiem PT', 'Parvathaneni U']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180921,United States,Int J Part Ther,International journal of particle therapy,101674108,,,,PMC6871593,,['NOTNLM'],"['MCC', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'abscopal effects', 'high LET radiation', 'immunotherapy', 'neutron radiotherapy']",2018/07/01 00:00,2018/07/01 00:01,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2018/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.14338/IJPT-18-00012.1 [doi]', 'Customer: THEIJPT-D-18-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Part Ther. 2018 Summer;5(1):183-195. doi: 10.14338/IJPT-18-00012.1.

Materials and Methods: Pediatric patients with a histologic diagnosis of JPA after a biopsy or subtotal resection and at least 4 post-PBT MRIs were retrospectively reviewed. After PBT, tumors were contoured on follow-up T1-contrasted MRIs, and 3-dimensional volumes were plotted against time, with thresholds for progressive disease and partial response. Patterns of response, pseudoprogression, and progression were uncovered. Post-PBT clinical course was described by the need for further intervention and survivorship. Results: Fifteen patients with a median of 10 follow-up MRIs made up this report: 60% were heavily pretreated with multiple lines of chemotherapy, and 67% had undergone subtotal resection. With a median follow-up of 55.3 months after a median of 5400 centigray equivalents PBT, estimates of 5-year overall survival and intervention-free survival were 93% and 72%, respectively. The crude response rate of 73% included pseudoprogressing patients, who comprised 20% of the entire cohort; the phenomenon peaked between 3 and 8 months and resolved by 18 months. One nonresponder expired from progression. Post-PBT intervention was required in 53% of patients, with 1 patient resuming chemotherapy. There were no further resections or radiotherapy. One patient developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and another developed biopsy-proven radionecrosis. Conclusion: The PBT for inoperable/progressive JPA provided 72% 5-year intervention-free survival in heavily pretreated patients. Although most patients responded, 20% demonstrated pseudoprogression. The need for post-PBT surveillance for progression and treatment-induced sequelae should not be underestimated in this extended survivorship cohort.",['(c) Copyright 2016 International Journal of Particle Therapy.'],"['Mannina, Edward M', 'Bartlett, Greg K', 'McMullen, Kevin P']","['Mannina EM', 'Bartlett GK', 'McMullen KP']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20161230,United States,Int J Part Ther,International journal of particle therapy,101674108,,,,PMC6871611,,['NOTNLM'],"['juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma', 'proton beam therapy', 'pseudoprogression']",2016/10/01 00:00,2016/10/01 00:01,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.14338/IJPT-16-00020.1 [doi]', 'THEIJPT-D-16-00020 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Part Ther. 2016 Fall;3(2):291-299. doi: 10.14338/IJPT-16-00020.1.

In the gastrointestinal tract, the esophagus is the second most susceptible to candida infection, only after the oropharynx. Immunocompromised patients are most at risk, including patients with HIV/AIDS, leukemia, diabetics, and those who are receiving corticosteroids, radiation, and chemotherapy. Another group includes those who used antibiotics frequently and those who have esophageal motility disorder (cardiac achalasia and scleroderma). Patients complained of pain on swallowing, difficulty swallowing, and pain behind the sternum. On physical examination, there is a plaque that often occurs together with oral thrush. Endoscopic examination is the best approach to diagnose this disease by directly observing the white mucosal plaque-like lesions and exudates adherent to the mucosa. These adherent lesions cannot be washed off with water from irrigation. This disease is confirmed histologically by taking the biopsy or brushings of yeast and pseudohyphae invading mucosal cells.

In addition, its prompt diagnosis is usually challenging. This is due to its heterogeneity in clinical presentations and cytomorphological and immunophenotypical features together with potential associations with other hematologic neoplasms which can complicate the condition and delay accurate diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of CD4-positive mast cell leukaemia. Case Presentation: A 39-year-old male presented with acute onset of fever, abdominal pain, and generalized body aches of two-week duration. Peripheral blood smear showed circulating blasts (13%) with coarsely basophilic granulation. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate showed extensive infiltration with immature mast cells of blast-like morphology with trilineage dysplasia and evident hemophagocytic activity exhibited by histiocytes and neoplastic mast cells. BM biopsy was diffusely infiltrated with many atypical mast cells positive for CD45, CD117, mast cell tryptase, CD25, and CD4 with partial positivity for CD7 and CD30. Cytogenetics showed an abnormal karyotype: 47, XY, +1947, XY, +19[13]/46, XY[9]. Molecular analysis revealed a KIT D816V mutation consistent with a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis, mast cell leukaemia. Conclusion: The expression of T-cell associated markers by abnormal mast cells is well documented; however, CD4 and CD7 expression have not previously been described in association with mast cell leukaemia. Coexpression of CD2, CD4, CD7, and CD30 by the mast cells particularly in skin lesions may provoke misinterpretation as a cutaneous T-cell neoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CD4-positive mast cell leukaemia. Moreover, hemophagocytic mast cell leukaemia is a very rare morphologic variant, and possible correlation between this finding and expression of CD4 by neoplastic mast cells is a topic for further investigation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Dina Sameh Soliman et al.'],"['Soliman, Dina Sameh', 'Al-Sabbagh, Ahmad', 'Ibrahim, Feryal', 'Gameil, Amna', 'Yassin, Mohamed', 'El-Omri, Halima']","['Soliman DS', 'Al-Sabbagh A', 'Ibrahim F', 'Gameil A', 'Yassin M', 'El-Omri H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0624-3973', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7071-1252', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5812-8117']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill-Cornell Medicine, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20191027,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC6854920,,,,2019/11/28 06:00,2019/11/28 06:01,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2019/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1805270 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Oct 27;2019:1805270. doi: 10.1155/2019/1805270. eCollection 2019.,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies had revealed the important roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a variety of human cancers, including CRC. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with CRC remain largely undetermined. In the current study, the GSE21510 dataset was analyzed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in CRC samples. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used to perform Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks were constructed to reveal interactions among differentially expressed proteins. Kaplan-Meier analysis was subsequently performed to determine the association between key lncRNA expression and the overall survival of patients with CRC. A total of 107 upregulated lncRNAs and 43 downregulated lncRNAs were identified in CRC. A lncRNA mediated co-expression network was also constructed in CRC. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that lncRNAs were associated with a series of biological processes, including 'xenobiotic glucuronidation', 'rRNA processing', 'sister chromatid cohesion', 'cell proliferation', 'mitotic nuclear division' and 'cell cycle regulation'. Furthermore, a higher expression of small nucleolar RNA host gene 17, tetratricopeptide repeat domain 2B-antisense RNA (AS) 1, erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 4A-AS2, deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2, and a lower expression of muscle blind like splicing regulator 1-AS1 and LOC389332 were associated with shorter overall survival time in CRC samples.

In other lymphoid malignancies, however, such as the aggressive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), cell survival might rely instead or also on BCL-2 relative MCL-1. We have explored MCL-1 as a target for killing MCL cells by both genetic and pharmacologic approaches. In several MCL cell lines, MCL-1 knockout with an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system triggered spontaneous apoptosis. Accordingly, most MCL cell lines proved sensitive to the specific MCL-1 inhibitor S63845, and MCL-1 inhibition also proved efficacious in an MCL xenograft model. Furthermore, its killing efficacy rose on combination with venetoclax, the BCL-XL-specific inhibitor A-1331852, or Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, which reduced pro-survival signals. We also tested the MCL-1 inhibitor in primary samples from 13 MCL patients, using CD40L-expressing feeder cells to model their microenvironmental support. Notably, all unstimulated primary MCL samples were very sensitive to S63845, but the CD40L stimulation attenuated their sensitivity. Mass cytometric analysis revealed that the stimulation likely conveyed protection by elevating BCL-XL and MCL-1. Accordingly, sensitivity of the CD40L-stimulated cells to S63845 was substantially restored by co-treatment with venetoclax, the BCL-XL-specific inhibitor or ibrutinib. Overall, our findings indicate that MCL-1 is very important for survival of MCL cells and that the MCL-1 inhibitor, both alone and together with ibrutinib, venetoclax or a BCL-XL inhibitor, offers promise for novel improved MCL therapies.",,"['Dengler, Michael A', 'Teh, Charis E', 'Thijssen, Rachel', 'Gangoda, Lahiru', 'Lan, Ping', 'Herold, Marco J', 'Gray, Daniel H', 'Kelly, Gemma L', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Adams, Jerry M']","['Dengler MA', 'Teh CE', 'Thijssen R', 'Gangoda L', 'Lan P', 'Herold MJ', 'Gray DH', 'Kelly GL', 'Roberts AW', 'Adams JM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-5720'],"['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Institute for Advanced and Applied Chemical Synthesis, Jinan University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, 519070, China.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia. adams@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia. adams@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191126,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,2019/11/28 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-1122-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-1122-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Feb;39(9):2009-2023. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-1122-x.

SKP2 expression is regulated by mitogenic stimuli and by Notch signaling, a key pathway in T-cell development and in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, it is not known whether SKP2 plays a role in the development of T-ALL. Here, we determined that SKP2 function is relevant for T-ALL leukemogenesis, whereas is dispensable for T-cell development. Targeted inhibition of SKP2 by genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade markedly inhibited proliferation of human T-ALL cells in vitro and antagonized disease in vivo in murine and xenograft leukemia models, with little effect on normal tissues. We also demonstrate a novel feed forward feedback loop by which Notch and IL-7 signaling cooperatively converge on SKP2 induction and cell cycle activation. These studies show that the Notch/SKP2/p27(Kip1) pathway plays a unique role in T-ALL development and provide a proof-of-concept for the use of SKP2 as a new therapeutic target in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).",,"['Rodriguez, Sonia', 'Abundis, Christina', 'Boccalatte, Francesco', 'Mehrotra, Purvi', 'Chiang, Mark Y', 'Yui, Mary A', 'Wang, Lin', 'Zhang, Huajia', 'Zollman, Amy',

CD19.CAR.NK92 therapy significantly increased cytolytic activity at E:T ratios (1:1-10:1) via LDH release and prominent induction of apoptosis in all cell lines, including in anti-CD20 resistant lymphoma cells. The kinetics of CD19.CAR.NK92 cell death measured via droplet-based single cell microfluidics analysis showed that most lymphoma cells were killed by single contact, with anti-CD20 resistant cell lines requiring significantly longer contact duration with NK cells. In addition, systems biology transcriptomic analyses of flow-sorted lymphoma cells co-cultured with CD19.CAR.NK92 revealed conserved activation of IFNgamma signaling, execution of apoptosis, ligand binding, and immunoregulatory and chemokine signaling pathways. Furthermore, a 92-plex cytokine panel analysis showed increased secretion of granzymes, increased secretion of FASL, CCL3, and IL10 in anti-CD20 resistant SUDHL4 cells with induction of genes relevant to mTOR and G2/M checkpoint activation, which were noted in all anti-CD20 resistant cells co-cultured with CD19.CAR.NK92 cells.

Immune reconstitution could be influenced by events such as conditioning, infections, and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Factors influencing the TCR diversity are of great interest to fine-tune the strategy for donor selection and to optimize standard of care. In this work, immunosequencing of the TCR CDR3beta region was carried out in a large cohort of 116 full chimeric recipients at 1 year post-HSCT and their respective donors prior to transplantation. The repertoire overlap before and after HSCT was minimal, supporting de novo reconstitution as a primary pathway at any age. Among the parameters investigated, increased patient and/or donor age as well as positive CMV serologic status reinforced by CMV infection/reactivation were the ones significantly associated with a reduced diversity at 1 year post-HSCT. CMV-specific T-cell clones were shown to influence the clonality of the repertoire alongside the expansion of limited numbers of non-CMV T-cell populations. Interestingly, at the exception of CMV infection/reactivation, TCR diversity was not predictive of GVHD, relapse, death, or infections post-HSCT.",,"['Buhler, Stephane', 'Bettens, Florence', 'Dantin, Carole', 'Ferrari-Lacraz, Sylvie', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Mamez, Anne-Claire', 'Masouridi-Levrat, Stavroula', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Villard, Jean']","['Buhler S', 'Bettens F', 'Dantin C', 'Ferrari-Lacraz S', 'Ansari M', 'Mamez AC', 'Masouridi-Levrat S', 'Chalandon Y', 'Villard J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9341-8104'],"['Transplantation Immunology Unit and National Reference Laboratory for Histocompatibility, Department of Diagnostic, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland. stephane.buhler@hcuge.ch.', 'Transplantation Immunology Unit and National Reference Laboratory for Histocompatibility, Department of Diagnostic, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Service of Haematology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Transplantation Immunology Unit and National Reference Laboratory for Histocompatibility, Department of Diagnostic, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Department, Onco-Hematology Unit, Geneva University Hospitals and Cansearch research laboratory, Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Service of Haematology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Service of Haematology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Service of Haematology, Department of Oncology, Geneva University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Transplantation Immunology Unit and National Reference Laboratory for Histocompatibility, Department of Diagnostic, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland. jean.villard@hcuge.ch.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191126,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/etiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/etiology/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2019/11/28 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2019/11/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0654-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0654-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 May;34(5):1422-1432. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0654-y.

However, suitable target antigens are scarce, restricting these strategies to very few tumor types. Here, we report on a T cell-engaging antibody derivative that comes in two complementary halves and addresses antigen combinations instead of single molecules. Each half, now coined hemibody, contains an antigen-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to either the variable light (VL) or variable heavy (VH) chain domain of an anti-CD3 antibody.

Although eradication of dinosaurs is a dramatic example of extinction dynamics, similar application of massive eco-evolutionary force in cancer treatment is typically limited by host toxicity. Here, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of Anthropocene species extinctions as an alternative model for curative cancer therapy. Human activities can produce extinctions of large, diverse, and geographically distributed populations. The extinction of a species typically follows a pattern in which initial demographic and ecological insults reduce the size and heterogeneity of the population. The surviving individuals, with decreased genetic diversity and often fragmented ecology, are then vulnerable to small stochastic perturbations that further reduce the population until extinction is inevitable. We hypothesize large, diverse, and disseminated cancer populations can be eradicated using similar evolutionary dynamics. Initial therapy is applied to reduce population size and diversity and followed by new treatments to exploit the eco-evolutionary vulnerability of small and/or declining populations. Mathematical models and computer simulations demonstrate initial reductive treatment followed immediately by demographic and ecological perturbations, similar to the empirically derived treatment of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia, can consistently achieve curative outcomes in nonpediatric cancers.

We demonstrate that BCL-3, a nuclear IkB protein that regulates NF-kB, also controls TLR-induced MAPK activity by regulating the stability of the TPL-2 kinase. TPL-2 is essential for MAPK activation by TLR ligands, and the rapid proteasomal degradation of active TPL-2 is a critical mechanism limiting TLR-induced MAPK activity. We reveal that TPL-2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and identify the nucleus as the primary site for TPL-2 degradation. BCL-3 interacts with TPL-2 and promotes its degradation by promoting its nuclear localization. As a consequence, Bcl3 (-/-) macrophages have increased TPL-2 stability following TLR stimulation, leading to increased MAPK activity and MAPK-dependent responses. Moreover, BCL-3-mediated regulation of TPL-2 stability sets the MAPK activation threshold and determines the amount of TLR ligand required to initiate the production of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the nucleus is a key site in the regulation of TLR-induced MAPK activity. BCL-3 links control of the MAPK and NF-kB pathways in the nucleus, and BCL-3-mediated TPL-2 regulation impacts on the cellular decision to initiate proinflammatory cytokine production in response to TLR activation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Attempts to exploit SYK therapeutically in AML have shown promising results in combination with chemotherapy, likely reflecting induced mechanisms of resistance to single-agent treatment in vivo. We conducted a genome-scale open reading frame (ORF) resistance screen and identified activation of the RAS-MAPK-ERK pathway as one major mechanism of resistance to SYK inhibitors. This finding was validated in AML cell lines with innate and acquired resistance to SYK inhibitors. Furthermore, patients with AML with select mutations activating these pathways displayed early resistance to SYK inhibition. To circumvent SYK inhibitor therapy resistance in AML, we demonstrate that a MEK and SYK inhibitor combination is synergistic in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide justification for use of ORF screening to identify resistance mechanisms to kinase inhibitor therapy in AML lacking distinct mutations and to direct novel combination-based strategies to abrogate these. SIGNIFICANCE: The integration of functional genomic screening with the study of mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance in model systems and human patients identified resistance to SYK inhibitors through MAPK signaling in AML. The dual targeting of SYK and the MAPK pathway offers a combinatorial strategy to overcome this resistance.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 161.",['(c)2019 American

In addition, other immunotherapies are being developed such as cell therapy with natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. The rapid and potent cytotoxic activity of NK cells respecting healthy cells and the possibility of expansion, manipulating them and combining them with other treatments, make these cells a powerful therapeutic tool to be developed, with a very high safety profile.

Currently, the interactions between malignant myeloid cells and the immune microenvironment, especially T cells and B cells, remain poorly characterized. METHODS: In this study, we systematically analyzed the T cell receptor and B cell receptor (TCR and BCR) repertoires from the RNA-seq data of 145 pediatric and 151 adult AML samples as well as 73 non-tumor peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: We inferred over 225,000 complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences in TCR alpha, beta, gamma, and delta chains and 1,210,000 CDR3 sequences in B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains. We found higher clonal expansion of both T cells and B cells in the AML microenvironment and observed many differences between pediatric and adult AML. Most notably, adult AML samples have significantly higher level of B cell activation and more secondary Ig class switch events than pediatric AML or non-tumor samples. Furthermore, adult AML with highly expanded IgA2 B cells, which might represent an immunosuppressive microenvironment, are associated with regulatory T cells and worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive characterization of the AML immune receptor repertoires improved our understanding of T cell and B cell immunity in AML, which may provide insights into immunotherapies in hematological malignancies.",,"['Zhang, Jian', 'Hu, Xihao', 'Wang, Jin', 'Sahu, Avinash Das', 'Cohen, David', 'Song, Li', 'Ouyang, Zhangyi', 'Fan, Jingyu', 'Wang, Binbin', 'Fu, Jingxin', 'Gu, Shengqing', 'Sade-Feldman, Moshe', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Li, Wuju', 'Ying, Xiaomin', 'Li, Bo', 'Liu, X Shirley']","['Zhang J', 'Hu X', 'Wang J', 'Sahu AD', 'Cohen D', 'Song L', 'Ouyang Z', 'Fan J', 'Wang B', 'Fu J', 'Gu S', 'Sade-Feldman M', 'Hacohen N', 'Li W', 'Ying X', 'Li B', 'Liu XS']",,"['Center for Computational Biology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard T.H.

Different multiprotein complexes are involved in the fine regulation of cell division, including the mitotic promoting factor and the anaphase promoting complex. Prolonged mitosis can result in cellular division, cell death, or mitotic slippage, the latter leading to a new interphase without cellular division. Mitotic slippage is one of the causes of genomic instability and has an important therapeutic and clinical impact. It has been widely studied in solid tumors but not in hematological malignancies, in particular, in acute leukemia. We review the literature data available on mitotic regulation, alterations in mitotic proteins occurring in acute leukemia, induction of prolonged mitosis and its consequences, focusing in particular on the balance between cell death and mitotic slippage and on its therapeutic potentials. We also present the most recent preclinical and clinical data on the efficacy of second-generation mitotic drugs (CDK1-Cyclin B1, APC/CCDC20, PLK, Aurora kinase inhibitors). Despite the poor clinical activity showed by these drugs as single agents, they offer a potential therapeutic window for synthetic lethal combinations aimed to selectively target leukemic cells at the right time, thus decreasing the risk of mitotic slippage events.",,"['Ghelli Luserna di Rora, Andrea', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Simonetti, Giorgia']","['Ghelli Luserna di Rora A', 'Martinelli G', 'Simonetti G']",,"['Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via P.

In this retrospective study, we evaluated the clinical impact of very early chimerism on the clinical outcome after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: The study group included 38 boys and 18 girls. Very early chimerism was evaluated on days + 7, + 14, + 21 and + 28 after the transplant. Short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction (STR PCR) was used to analyse chimerism. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 84 and 80%, respectively. The OS in the group of 24 patients with complete donor chimerism on day + 14 was 83%, and it did not differ statistically compared to the 32 patients with mixed chimerism on day + 14 (OS was 84%). In our cohort of patients, the matched unrelated donor, male gender of donor, number of transplanted cells above 4.47 x 10(6) kg and no serotherapy with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) were statistically related to a higher level of donor chimerism. The immunophenotypes of disease, age of patient at time HSCT, recipient sex, stem cell source (peripheral blood/bone marrow) and conditioning regimen had no impact on early chimerism. Acute graft versus host disease grades II-IV was diagnosed in 23 patients who presented with donor chimerism levels above 60% on day 7.

It was found that 6-MITC inhibited the viability of human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells along with extensive mitotic arrest, spindle multipolarity, and cytoplasmic vacuole accumulation. The evidence of autophagy included the validation of autophagosomes with double-layered membranes under transmission electron microscopy, LC3I/II conversion, and the induction of G2/M phase arrest observed with acridine orange staining of treated cells, as well as the elevation of phosphorylated-histone H3 expression at the M phase. With regard to the expression of proteins related to mitosis, the downregulation of p-CHK1, p-CHK2, p-cdc25c, and p-cdc2, as well as the upregulation of cyclin B1, p-cdc20, cdc23, BubR1, Mad2, and p-plk-1 was observed. The knockdown of cdc20 was unable to block the effect of 6-MITC. The differentiation of k562 cells into monocytes, granulocytes, and megakaryocytes was not affected by 6-MITC.

Although several mechanisms have been enumerated for VCR resistance, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report reflecting the suppressive effect of oncogenic pathways on VCR cytotoxicity in ALL. The results of the present study indicated that both pre-B ALL-derived REH and Nalm-6 cells were partly resistant to VCR, with this note that Nalm-6 cells displayed more resistant phenotype. More interestingly, we showed for the first time that among inhibitors of different signaling pathways including those targeting PI3K, ERK, and NF-kappaB, the enhancive effect of small molecule inhibitor of c-Myc 10058-F4 was more significant on VCR cytotoxicity. Inhibition of c-Myc in VCR-treated Nalm-6 cells promoted a caspase-3-dependent apoptosis not only through altering the balance between death promoters to death suppressors, but also via modulating the expression of autophagy-related genes. Noteworthy, favorable impact of 10058-F4 on VCR anti-leukemic effect was not restricted to the induction of cell death and this agent also reinforced VCR anti-proliferative effect through disturbing cell cycle progression and hampering the expression of Pin1 and hTERT.

Gene expression analyses demonstrated upregulation of genes involved in stemness and leukemogenesis, with parallel downregulation of target genes of Gata1 and Gata2 responsible for erythroid differentiation. Cdx4 induced a proteomic profile that overlapped with a cluster of proteins previously defined to represent the most primitive human erythroid progenitors. Whole-exome sequencing of diseased mice identified recurrent mutations significantly enriched for transcription factors involved in erythroid lineage specification, as well as TP53 target genes partly identical to the ones reported in patients with AEL.

Nevertheless, its use in older patients is considerably limited due to increased toxicity. BST-236 (INN aspacytarabine) is a novel cytarabine prodrug designed to deliver high-dose cytarabine to target cells with reduced systemic exposure to free cytarabine. This phase 1/2a dose-escalation study was designed to evaluate BST-236 safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in older or unfit-for-intensive-therapy patients with acute leukemia. Twenty-six patients, unfit for standard therapy, who were either relapsed/refractory or newly diagnosed, received BST-236 in 6 dose-escalating cohorts (range 0.3 to 6 g/m2 per day). BST-236 was administered intravenously once daily over 60 minutes for 6 consecutive days. The median age was 76.5 (26 to 90), with 84.6% of patients >/=70 years. BST-236 was safe and well tolerated. The maximal tolerated dose was 6 g/m2 per day. Overall response rate was 29.6%. A subgroup analysis of newly diagnosed patients with AML, de novo or secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome, unfit for standard induction (median age 78), demonstrated overall response of 45.5%. The median overall survival was 6.5 months and was not reached in patients achieving complete remission. The findings of this phase 1/2 study suggest that BST-236 safely delivers high and efficacious cytarabine doses to older patients who are unfit for standard induction and lays the foundation for further studies of BST-236 in AML.

METHODS: Anonymous Chinese-language questionnaires were distributed to adults with chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) receiving TKIs therapy >3 months regarding symptoms' incidence, severity, and HRQoL. The multivariate cumulative logistic regression model was built to identify variables associated with the symptoms. General Linear Model was used to model the relationship between symptoms and HRQoL using stepwise-forward algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 1142 respondents were included in this study. The top 10 common TKI-related symptoms were fatigue, periorbital and lower limb edema, chest distress and shortness of breath, memory deterioration, skin color change, alopecia, muscle cramp, weight gain and musculoskeletal pain, and itchy skin. One hundred forty-one (50%) females </=50 years reported menstrual disorders. Female, married, therapy duration 1 to 3 years, and foreign generic TKIs were associated with increased symptoms' frequency and severity. In contrast, receiving nilotinib or dasatinib, and achieving a complete cytogenetic response but not complete molecular response were associated with fewer and milder symptoms. Chest distress and shortness of breath and loss of appetite were associated with both lower physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores; fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness and abdominal pain, were associated with lower PCS score; anxiety-depression, was associated with lower MCS score in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and social variables, type of TKI-therapy, therapy duration, and depth of response were associated with patient-reported symptoms in persons with chronic phase CML.

In this study, we identified and functionally validated the network of enhancers that controls expression of ABCB1. We show that exposure of leukemia cells to daunorubicin activated an integrated stress response-like transcriptional program to induce ABCB1 through remodeling and activation of an ATF4-bound, stress-responsive enhancer. Protracted stress primed enhancers for rapid increases in activity following re-exposure of cells to daunorubicin, providing an epigenetic memory of prior drug treatment. In primary human AML, exposure of fresh blast cells to daunorubicin activated the stress-responsive enhancer and led to dose-dependent induction of ABCB1. Dynamic induction of ABCB1 by diverse stressors, including chemotherapy, facilitated escape of leukemia cells from targeted third-generation ABCB1 inhibition, providing an explanation for the failure of ABCB1 inhibitors in clinical trials. Stress-induced upregulation of ABCB1 was mitigated by combined use of the pharmacologic inhibitors U0126 and ISRIB, which inhibit stress signaling and have potential for use as adjuvants to enhance the activity of ABCB1 inhibitors.",,"['Williams, Mark S', 'Amaral, Fabio Mr', 'Simeoni, Fabrizio', 'Somervaille, Tim Cp']","['Williams MS', 'Amaral FM', 'Simeoni F', 'Somervaille TC']",,,['eng'],['C5759/A20971 /CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-N-(4-(2-(4-chlorophenoxy)acetamido)cyclohexyl)acetamide)', '0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (U 0126)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cyclohexylamines/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC7269587,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell stress', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",2019/11/27 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['130809 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI130809 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2020 Mar 2;130(3):1217-1232. doi: 10.1172/JCI130809.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moringa oleifera possesses strong antioxidant properties due to the presence of various phytochemicals. In this study, we investigated the effect of M. oleifera leaf extract on markers of oxidative stress in HL60 cells exposed to oxidative stress. HL60 cells were incubated with different concentrations of M. oleifera leaf extract, and cells were harvested for viability assays on days 1, 2, and 3. Antioxidant indexes (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) were measured on days 1, 2, and 3. Supplementation with the moringa leaf extract at all concentrations resulted in significant reductions in lipid peroxidation in cells that were or were not incubated in an environment with excess oxidative stress. The most significant reduction in this parameter occurred after 24 h of incubation. The results show that reductions seen in this parameter may be due to the modulation of the endogenous antioxidant defense system by extract supplementation. Cell viability was also improved in cells incubated in moringa leaf extract at concentrations of 800 and 1000 mug/mL. This finding, however, did not corroborate with lipid peroxidation results at 1000 mug/mL extract supplementation. Further investigations are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism responsible for increased cell viability at this concentration. We can, therefore, conclude that the moringa leaf extract offered added protection from oxidative stress within the first 24 h, as well as increasing cell viability at certain concentrations.",,"['Dilworth, Lowell L', 'Stennett, Dewayne', 'Omoruyi, Felix O']","['Dilworth LL', 'Stennett D', 'Omoruyi FO']",,"['Department of Pathology and The University of the West Indies Mona Campus, Mona, Jamaica.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies Mona Campus, Mona, Jamaica.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191126,United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Moringa oleifera/*chemistry', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['HL60', 'Moringa oleifera', 'antioxidant', 'antiproliferative', 'catalase', 'glutathione']",2019/11/27 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jmf.2019.0192 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2020 Jul;23(7):728-734. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2019.0192.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively registered AAP (n = 168) during treatment of 2,448 consecutive ALL patients aged 1.0-45.9 years diagnosed from July 2008 to October 2018 and treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol. RESULTS: Compared with patients aged 1.0-9.9 years, adjusted AAP hazard ratios (HRa) were associated with higher age with almost identical HRa (1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3; P = .02) for adolescents (10.0-17.9 years) and adults (18.0-45.9 years). The day 280 cumulative incidences of AAP were 7.0% for children (1.0-9.9 years: 95% CI, 5.4 to 8.6), 10.1% for adolescents (10.0 to 17.9 years: 95% CI, 7.0 to 13.3), and 11.0% for adults (18.0-45.9 years: 95% CI, 7.1 to 14.9; P = .03). Adolescents had increased odds of both acute (odds ratio [OR], 5.2; 95% CI, 2.1 to 13.2; P = .0005) and persisting complications (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 18.4; P = .0002) compared with children (1.0-9.9 years), whereas adults had increased odds of only persisting complications (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 11.8; P = .01). Fifteen of 34 asparaginase-rechallenged patients developed a second AAP. Asparaginase was truncated in 17/21 patients with AAP who subsequently developed leukemic relapse, but neither AAP nor the asparaginase truncation was associated with increased risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: Older children and adults had similar AAP risk, whereas morbidity was most pronounced among adolescents. Asparaginase re-exposure should be considered only for patients with an anticipated high risk of leukemic relapse, because multiple studies strongly indicate that reduction of asparaginase treatment intensity increases the risk of relapse.",,"['Rank, Cecilie U', 'Wolthers, Benjamin O', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Albertsen, Birgitte K', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Overgaard, Ulrik M', 'Toft, Nina', 'Nielsen, Ove J', 'Wehner, Peder S', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Heyman, Mats M', 'Malmros, Johan', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Tomaszewska-Toporska, Beata', 'Lund, Bendik', 'Jarvis, Kirsten B', 'Quist-Paulsen, Petter', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda E', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Wartiovaara-Kautto, Ulla', 'Lepik, Kristi', 'Punab, Mari', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Rank CU', 'Wolthers BO', 'Grell K', 'Albertsen BK', 'Frandsen TL', 'Overgaard UM', 'Toft N', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Wehner PS', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Heyman MM', 'Malmros J', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Tomaszewska-Toporska B', 'Lund B', 'Jarvis KB', 'Quist-Paulsen P', 'Vaitkeviciene GE', 'Griskevicius L', 'Taskinen M', 'Wartiovaara-Kautto U', 'Lepik K', 'Punab M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Schmiegelow K']",,"['Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Herlev University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Tallinn Children's Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia."", 'Tartu University Hospital, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Reykjavik University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191126,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Estonia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Lithuania/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6953441,,,,2019/11/27 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.02208 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Jan 10;38(2):145-154. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.02208.
