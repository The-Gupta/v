PROCEDURE: Twenty children (10 males and 10 females) 9-11 years of age (median age = 10.6 years) were assessed by the UQAC-UQAM test battery and then compared to recent provincial norms. This pilot study was also an opportunity to validate this test battery as a reliable tool for clinical or research purposes in the area of chronic or disabling diseases in children. Eleven motor skill variables grouped into five factors have been measured (speed, agility, balance, coordination, and reaction time). RESULTS: Scores from 10 of the 11 motor skill tests showed significant differences when compared to the control group (P </= 0.05). Nearly 50% of patients obtained an average score below the 15th percentile. Furthermore, stepwise discriminant analysis allowed classifying successfully 88.4% of children in the correct group (ALL or Control). The normal development of GMS among children affected by ALL appears to have been compromised. The UQAC-UQAM test battery seems to be sensitive enough to quantify with precision the extent of the motor impairment in these children. CONCLUSION: The UQAC-UQAM test battery appears to be a useful tool to evaluate the extent to which ALL survivors are affected. Early motor intervention should be considered for those patients even during the treatment periods.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Leone, Mario', 'Viret, Pierre', 'Bui, Hung Tien', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Kalinova, Emilia', 'Comtois, Alain-Steve']","['Leone M', 'Viret P', 'Bui HT', 'Laverdiere C', 'Kalinova E', 'Comtois AS']","['Kinesiology Department of Health Sciences, Kinesiology Division and Health Sciences Department, University of Quebec in Chicoutimi, Saguenay, Quebec, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire sur la Qualite et les Saines Habitudes de vie, University of Quebec in Chicoutimi, Saguenay, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130921,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Skills/*drug effects', 'Neurologic Examination/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'gross motor skills', 'survivors']",2013/10/12 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24731 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jan;61(1):46-52. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24731.

However, it is limited to date for solid tumors. In this study, the pH-sensitive nanoparticles based on poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are synthesized by coupling 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride with the first generation PAMAM. The modified dendrimers can self-assemble in aqueous solution to form nanoparticles with a diameter of 125-435 nm. The nanoparticles are relatively stable at physiological pH (pH 7.4) but dissociated in acidic environments (pH 5.0 or 6.0). The present studies show that the proliferation inhibition and albumin secretion of hepatoma carcinoma cells are enhanced with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) encapsulated in the nanoparticles. The enhancement of induced differentiation is due to the high internalization of ATRA in the cells by the nanoparticles. These experimental results demonstrate that pH-sensitive nanoparticles may be efficient for improving the differentiation therapy for solid tumor.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These T cells are usually CD4+CD8- and strongly express CD25, although some variability in this basic pattern may be found. Here we report a case with a very unusual CD1a positive phenotype. METHODS: Samples from peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, lymph node, and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a 45-year-old male patient with a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder were immunophenotyped by multiparametric flow cytometry. Analysis of HTLV-I genome integration in tumoral cells was performed by PCR. RESULTS: Neoplastic T cells were cCD3, CD2/CD5/CD30/CD25, and CD1a positive, but CD3/CD7/CD4/CD8/CD34/CD10/TdT negative. Serology and integration of HTLV-I were positive. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, CD1a expression has not been previously described in this entity.

Here, the role of C/EBPbeta expressed by bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) in B-cell lymphopoiesis was examined. The size of the precursor B-cell population in bone marrow was reduced in C/EBPbeta-knockout (KO) mice. When bone marrow cells from C/EBPbeta-KO mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated wild-type (WT) mice, which provide a normal bone marrow microenvironment, the size of the precursor B-cell population was restored to a level equivalent to that generated by WT bone marrow cells. In coculture experiments, BMMSCs from C/EBPbeta-KO mice did not support the differentiation of WT c-Kit(+) Sca-1(+) Lineage(-) hematopoietic stem cells (KSL cells) into precursor B cells, whereas BMMSCs from WT mice did. The impaired differentiation of KSL cells correlated with the reduced production of CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1 by the cocultured C/EBPbeta-deficient BMMSCs. The ability of C/EBPbeta-deficient BMMSCs to undergo osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was also defective. The survival of leukemic precursor B cells was poorer when they were cocultured with C/EBPbeta-deficient BMMSCs than when they were cocultured with WT BMMSCs.

In the mechanistic study, CQ was found to down-regulate HDAC1, -3, -4, and -5 in both myeloma and leukemia cells. Computer modeling analysis revealed that CQ was well docked into the active pocket of the enzyme, where the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in CQ formed stable coordinate bonds with the zinc ion, and the hydroxyl group from CQ formed an effective hydrogen bond with Asp-267. Moreover, co-treatment with CQ and zinc/copper chloride led to decreased Ac-H3. Furthermore, CQ inhibited the activity of Class I and IIa HDACs in the cell-free assays, demonstrating that CQ interfered with HDAC activity.

Pluripotent stem cells during differentiation are known to undergo changes in their morphofunctional properties, with particular reference to bioenergetic metabolic signatures involving endogenous fluorophores such as NAD(P)H, flavins, lipofuscin-like lipopigments. Since the development of regenerative therapies based on pluripotent cells requires a careful monitoring of the successful maturation into the desired phenotype, aim of our work is to evaluate the AF potential to assess the differentiation phases in a murine stem cell model. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintained with and without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), embryoid bodies (EBs), and EB-derived cells undergoing spontaneous differentiation toward the hematopoietic lineage have been used as a sample models. Cell AF properties have been characterized upon 366-nm excitation, under living conditions and in the absence of exogenous markers. Imaging, microspectrofluorometric techniques, and spectral fitting analysis based on the spectral parameters of each endogenous fluorophore have been applied to estimate their contribution to the whole cell AF emission spectra. Specific cytochemical labeling has been performed to validate AF data. RESULTS: Depending on the differentiation phases, cells undergo changes in morphology, AF distribution patterns, and AF emission spectral profiles. These latter reflect variations in the single endogenous fluorophore contribution to the overall emission. The coenzyme NAD(P)H accounts for up to 80% of the whole spectral area. The free form prevails on the bound one, and their changes have been investigated in terms of NAD(P)Hbound/free and redox ratios. These values vary in agreement with a slow metabolic activity and prevailing glycolytic metabolism in the undifferentiated HM1 cells, an increased metabolic activity still relying on glycolysis during the early differentiation phases, and an increased oxidative phosphorylation in EB and hematopoietic precursor cells. Lipofuscin-like lipopigments decrease following differentiation, and porphyrins contributing for less than 5%, prevail in the more actively differentiating cells. These results reflect the shift between anaerobic and aerobic respiration following differentiation, consistently with a decreased autophagy of cell organelles (i.e., mitochondria, as a strategy reported in the literature to keep the undifferentiated homeostasis state), higher mitochondrial activity with more numerous NADH binding sites and synthesis of heme as prosthetic group of proteins, that is, cytochromes. CONCLUSIONS: These data open promising perspectives for the monitoring of stem cells differentiation under living conditions without labeling with exogenous agents (inducing perturbations when used in vivo), or immunomarkers not always available for veterinary and zootechnics, by exploiting endogenous fluorophores as intrinsic biomarkers of cell morphofunctional changes.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Santin, Giada', 'Paulis, Marianna', 'Vezzoni, Paolo', 'Pacchiana, Giovanni', 'Bottiroli, Giovanni', 'Croce, Anna C']","['Santin G', 'Paulis M', 'Vezzoni P', 'Pacchiana G', 'Bottiroli G', 'Croce AC']","['IGM-CNR and Department of Biology & Biotechnology, University Pavia, Pavia, 27100, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,United States,Lasers Surg Med,Lasers in surgery and medicine,8007168,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '53-59-8 (NADP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/chemistry/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Respiration', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microspectrophotometry', 'NADP/chemistry/metabolism', '*Optical Imaging', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",['NOTNLM'],"['NAD(P)H', 'embryoid bodies', 'hematopoietic precursors', 'imaging', 'lipofuscin-like lipopigments', 'microspectrofluorometry']",2013/10/12 06:00,2014/06/07 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/lsm.22182 [doi]'],ppublish,Lasers Surg Med. 2013 Nov;45(9):597-607. doi: 10.1002/lsm.22182.

BSG contains hydroxycinnamic acids, and phenolic-rich extracts from BSG have previously demonstrated the ability to protect against oxidant-induced DNA damage. The present study investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of eight phenolic extracts from BSG: four pale (P1-P4) and four black (B1-B4) extracts. RESULTS: BSG extracts were more cytotoxic in Jurkat T than U937 cells, with lower IC(5)(0) values in Jurkat T cells, measured using the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Pale BSG extracts P2 and P3 showed the greatest anti-inflammatory potential, significantly (P < 0.05) reducing interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4, P2 only), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. In addition, extracts P1-P3 and B2-B4 showed significant (P < 0.05) antioxidant effects, determined by the cellular antioxidant activity assays superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione content (GSH). CONCLUSION: Phenolic extracts from BSG, particularly the pale BSG extracts, have the ability to reduce a stimulated cytokine production and may also protect against cellular oxidative stress. Results of the present study highlight the potential of BSG phenolic extracts to act as functional food ingredients, providing an alternative use and improving the value of this brewing industry co-product.",['(c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.'],"['McCarthy, Aoife L', ""O'Callaghan, Yvonne C"", 'Connolly, Alan', 'Piggott, Charles O', 'FitzGerald, Richard J', ""O'Brien, Nora M""]","['McCarthy AL', ""O'Callaghan YC"", 'Connolly A', 'Piggott CO', 'FitzGerald RJ', ""O'Brien NM""]","['School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131021,England,J Sci Food Agric,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,0376334,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Industrial Waste)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/analysis/economics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/analysis/economics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Antioxidants/analysis/economics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Beer/economics/microbiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coumaric Acids/analysis/economics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Edible Grain/*chemistry/economics', 'Food, Fortified/analysis/economics', 'Food-Processing Industry/economics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/analysis/economics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Industrial Waste/*analysis/economics', 'Ireland', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Phenols/analysis/economics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Pigmentation', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/economics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Recycling']",['NOTNLM'],"['anti-inflammatory', 'antioxidant', ""brewers' spent grain (BSG)"", 'phenolic extracts']",2013/10/12 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jsfa.6421 [doi]'],ppublish,J Sci Food Agric. 2014 May;94(7):1373-9. doi: 10.1002/jsfa.6421.

Besides surgical resection, treatments for prostate cancer include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Advancement of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent state limits the potential of conventional therapeutic approaches. Bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteosomal inhibitor for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, has been shown to have a positive effect on the inhibition of prostate cancer growth. Unfortunately, bortezomib has a very narrow therapeutic window, which can lead to severe side effects. Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) is a genetically engineered, thermally responsive macromolecular carrier that enables a targeted delivery of the bound molecule because of its soluble property under normal physiologic conditions. In addition, ELP aggregates in response to mild hyperthermia. Using ELP as a carrier, it is possible to improve the pharmacological properties of the therapeutic drug as well as reduce toxicity in normal tissues. In this work, we have investigated the combination treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells with bortezomib and the C-terminal part of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein bound to the ELP carrier. We have found that combination treatment with bortezomib and ELP-bound p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein leads to increased cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis with respect to single treatments. We believe that this approach represents a promising direction for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",,"['Mikecin, Ana-Matea', 'Walker, Leslie R', 'Kuna, Marija', 'Raucher, Drazen']","['Mikecin AM', 'Walker LR', 'Kuna M', 'Raucher D']","['aDepartment of Biochemistry, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, USA bDepartment of Molecular Medicine, Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Androgens/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*chemistry', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2013/10/12 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000036 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2014 Feb;25(2):189-99. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000036.,PMC3915535,,"['1R21CA137418-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA139589-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA139589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 CA135799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA137418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS541554'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

SF3B1mut, NOTCH1mut, TP53mut and XPO1mut were highly correlated to unmutated, whereas MYD88mut were associated with mutated IGHV status. Associations of diverse cytogenetic aberrations and mutations emerged: (1) SF3B1mut with del(11q), (2) NOTCH1mut and FBXW7mut with trisomy 12 and nearly exclusiveness of SF3B1mut, (3) MYD88mut with del(13q) sole and low frequencies of SF3B1mut, NOTCH1mut and FBXW7mut. In patients with normal karyotype only SF3B1mut were frequent, whereas NOTCH1mut rarely occurred. An adverse prognostic impact on time to treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) was observed for SF3B1mut, NOTCH1mut and TP53 disruption. In multivariate analyses SF3B1mut, IGHV mutational status and del(11q) were the only independent genetic markers for TTT, whereas for OS SF3B1mut, IGHV mutational status and TP53 disruption presented with significant impact.

These individuals must be treated with markedly lower (eg, 5-10% of the standard) doses of the prescribed medications. This paper describes a comparison of three different methods for the quantification of TPMT activity in red blood cells (RBC) and cultured human cell lines. We succeeded to perform the measurement of TPMT activity in a minimum amount of 1x10(6) cultured cells with an HPLC-UV system modified and optimized in our laboratory. The TPMT activity was linearly correlated with the cell concentration of the cultured cell line in a range of 1-10x10(6) cells. A significant correlation of determination of TPMT activity in RBC between radiometric detection by HPLC, classic radiochemical detection and UV detection by HPLC, was observed, correlation coefficient (r) were 0.72 and 0.73, respectively. The within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation of the HPLC-UV-based method were 8% and 16%, respectively. The evaluation of the methods was demonstrated by studying the TPMT activity in RBC isolated from 198 patients, as well as in MOLT4 leukemic cell line and its sub-cell lines with acquired resistance to 6-MP and 6-TG.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We have reported that the balance between the BCL2 family proteins BOK and MCL1 regulates human trophoblast cell fate and its alteration toward cell death typifies preeclampsia. Here we demonstrate that BOK is a potent inducer of autophagy as shown by increased LC3B-II production, autophagosomal formation and lysosomal activation in HEK 293. In contrast, using JEG3 cells we showed that prosurvival MCL1 acts as a repressor of autophagy via an interaction with BECN1, which is abrogated by BOK. We found that MCL1-cleaved products, specifically MCL1c157, trigger autophagy while the splicing variant MCL1S has no effect. Treatment of JEG3 cells with nitric oxide donor SNP resulted in BOK-MCL1 rheostat dysregulation, favoring BOK accumulation, thereby inducing autophagy. Overexpression of MCL1 rescued oxidative stress-induced autophagy. Of clinical relevance, we report aberrant autophagy levels in the preeclamptic placenta due to impaired recruitment of BECN1 to MCL1. Our data provided the first evidence for a key role of the BOK-MCL1 system in regulating autophagy in the human placenta, whereby an adverse environment as seen in preeclampsia tilts the BOK-MCL1 balance toward the build-up of isoforms that triggers placental autophagy.",,"['Kalkat, Manpreet', 'Garcia, Julia', 'Ebrahimi, Jessica', 'Melland-Smith, Megan', 'Todros, Tullia', 'Post, Martin', 'Caniggia, Isabella']","['Kalkat M', 'Garcia J', 'Ebrahimi J', 'Melland-Smith M', 'Todros T', 'Post M', 'Caniggia I']","['Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute; Mount Sinai Hospital; Toronto, ON CA; Department of Physiology; University of Toronto; Toronto, ON CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131008,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (BOK protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeostasis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Placenta/drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Pre-Eclampsia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['BOK', 'MCL1', 'autophagy', 'oxidative stress', 'placenta', 'preeclampsia']",2013/10/12 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['26452 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.26452 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2013 Dec;9(12):2140-53. doi: 10.4161/auto.26452.

Sunitinib has not shown significant activity in GBM clinical trials, despite positive results seen in preclinical xenograft studies. We performed in vivo studies in transgenic Friend leukemia virus strain B mice: wild-type, Mdr1a/b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) genotypes were examined. The brain-to-plasma area under the curve ratio after an oral dose (20 mg/kg) was similar to the steady-state tissue distribution coefficient, indicating linear distribution kinetics in mice over this concentration range. Furthermore, the distribution of sunitinib to the brain increased after administration of selective P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) pharmacological inhibitors and a dual inhibitor, elacridar, comparable to that of the corresponding transgenic genotype. The brain-to-plasma ratio after coadministration of elacridar in wild-type mice was approximately 12 compared with approximately 17.3 in Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice. Overall, these findings indicate that there is a cooperation at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in restricting the brain penetration of sunitinib, and brain delivery can be enhanced by administration of a dual inhibitor. These data indicate that the presence of cooperative efflux transporters, P-gp and Bcrp, in an intact BBB can protect invasive glioma cells from chemotherapy. Thus, one may consider the use of transporter inhibition as a powerful adjuvant in the design of future clinical trials for the targeted delivery of sunitinib in GBM.",,"['Oberoi, Rajneet K', 'Mittapalli, Rajendar K', 'Elmquist, William F']","['Oberoi RK', 'Mittapalli RK', 'Elmquist WF']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Brain Barriers Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131010,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abcg2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Half-Life', 'Indoles/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pyrroles/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sunitinib', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,2013/10/12 06:00,2014/01/24 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.113.208959 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.113.208959 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2013 Dec;347(3):755-64. doi: 10.1124/jpet.113.208959.

The objective of this study was to indirectly compare these therapies using evidence from randomized trials versus imatinib, the current standard of care. METHODS: Randomized trials that included either dasatinib or nilotinib as first-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia were identified in a systematic review. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics and endpoint definitions were compared across trials. The outcome of interest was major molecular response by or at 12 months. A network meta-analysis was conducted to compare rates of major molecular response among therapies while adjusting for measurement of response by or at 12 months. RESULTS: One trial of nilotinib versus imatinib (ENESTnd) and two trials of dasatinib versus imatinib (DASISION and the S0325 Intergroup Trial) were identified. Major molecular response was reported by and at 12 months in ENESTnd, by 12 months in DASISION, and at 12 months in the S0325 Intergroup Trial. In the network meta-analysis, nilotinib had a 97% chance of having the highest rate of major molecular response compared to dasatinib and imatinib, corresponding to absolute rates of major molecular response by month 12 of 55.2%, 44.8% and 26.7%, respectively.

RESULTS: Groups were not statistically different with regards to baseline characteristics; however, the G-DLI group contained more sibling donors as opposed to unrelated donors than the non-DLI group. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the median overall survival (OS) of the non-DLI and G-DLI groups was not statistically different (8 months vs. 9 months, respectively, P = 0.5). Survival at 3 years was <10% in both groups. Univariate analysis identified response to FLAG, and new onset chronic GVHD as the only factors associated with improved OS.

Although imatinib (IM) treatment induced high rates of complete response (CR), serious acute and late complications are frequent, whereas more vexatiously resistance to chemotherapy and clinical relapse develops. Therefore, the efficacy of treatment in Ph+ ALL is still to be determined. In this study, we focused our attention on the potential benefit of rapamycin (RAPA), an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, in combination with IM on a Ph+ ALL cell line SUP-B15 and a primary Ph+ ALL sample in vitro. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that RAPA (50 nm) plus IM exerted good synergistic effect on Ph+ ALL cells. Notably, we found that IM treatment induced the abnormal activation of the components of mTOR signaling pathway and p-BCR-ABL, whereas RAPA potently eliminated this deleterious side effect induced by IM and might overcome the resistance to IM.

Although ATLL and IDH are considered specific manifestations of HTLV-I infection, several dermatological manifestations have been described in HTLV-I seropositive patients. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the prevalences of skin lesions in patients infected with HTLV-I in an area of Brazil endemic for HTLV-I infection and to compare these prevalences with those in seronegative individuals in the same region. METHODS: A prevalence study was conducted between 2008 and 2010 with two groups of individuals comprising, respectively, 179 HTLV-I seropositive (positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and positive Western blot analysis) and 193 HTLV-I seronegative individuals (ELISA-negative). The subjects were selected on a random basis and evaluated using a questionnaire to obtain epidemiological and clinical data. A physical examination was performed to verify the presence of skin lesions. RESULTS: Superficial mycoses were found in 54 (30.2%) seropositive subjects and in 26 (13.5%) of the seronegative group (P < 0.001). Xerosis was found in 39.1% of HTLV-I infected subjects and in 9.3% of seronegative controls (P < 0.001). Ichthyosis was diagnosed in nine (5.0%) HTLV-I seropositive subjects but in none of the control group (P = 0.001). A diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis was made in 43 (24.0%) HTLV-I infected subjects and in 24 (12.4%) seronegative controls (P = 0.004). Furthermore, dermatological manifestations were more intense in the HTLV-I seropositive group. CONCLUSIONS: Several dermatological manifestations are more common and more severe in HTLV-I seropositive subjects. The presence of these manifestations in an area endemic for HTLV-I infection may provide some clues in the investigation of this infection.",['(c) 2013 The International Society of Dermatology.'],"['Dantas, Lorena', 'Netto, Eduardo', 'Glesby, Marshall J', 'Carvalho, Edgar M', 'Machado, Paulo']","['Dantas L', 'Netto E', 'Glesby MJ', 'Carvalho EM', 'Machado P']","['Immunology Service, Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Salvador, BA, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dermatitis, Seborrheic/*virology', 'Dermatomycoses/*etiology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Ichthyosis/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/10/12 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijd.12170 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2014 Sep;53(9):1098-102. doi: 10.1111/ijd.12170.

We conducted a population-based cohort study to determine the risk of osteoporotic fractures among three cohorts of patients with newly diagnosed ET, PV, and CML. Patients were identified in medical registers including all Danish hospitals during 1980-2010 and were followed until first osteoporotic fracture. Fracture risk was compared to cohorts from the general population matched on age, sex and calendar year. We followed 7595 CMPN patients and 338 974 comparison cohort members. We found that the risk of femoral fracture after 5 years was consistently higher than the general population, being 3.01% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.20-4.10), 4.74% (95%CI: 4.06-5.52) and 4.64% (95%CI: 3.29-6.53) among ET, PV, and CML patients respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of CD30 expression in SM as assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 163 consecutive BM samples corresponding to 142 SM patients and 21 non-mastocytosis cases were studied. CD30 was positive in most SM patients (80%), but in only one non-mastocytosis case (4.8%). When combined with CD25, CD30 contributed to an improved accuracy over that of CD25 alone (98% versus 93%) mainly because most (eight of nine) of the well-differentiated SM (WDSM), who lacked CD25, were CD30(+). Similar levels of expression of CD30 were observed among all different subgroups of SM except mast cell leukaemia; among indolent SM (ISM) patients, no significant association was observed between the levels of CD30 expression and other clinical and biological features of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of CD30 associated with absence of CD25 contributes to the diagnosis of WDSM and its distinction from other subtypes of SM. By contrast, CD30 expression did not contribute either to prognostic stratification of ISM or to the differential diagnosis between ISM and aggressive SM cases.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Morgado, Jose M', 'Perbellini, Omar', 'Johnson, Ryan C', 'Teodosio, Cristina', 'Matito, Almudena', 'Alvarez-Twose, Ivan', 'Bonadonna, Patrizia', 'Zamo, Alberto', 'Jara-Acevedo, Maria', 'Mayado, Andrea', 'Garcia-Montero, Andres', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'George, Tracy I', 'Zanotti, Roberta', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Escribano, Luis', 'Sanchez-Munoz, Laura']","['Morgado JM', 'Perbellini O', 'Johnson RC', 'Teodosio C', 'Matito A', 'Alvarez-Twose I', 'Bonadonna P', 'Zamo A', 'Jara-Acevedo M', 'Mayado A', 'Garcia-Montero A', 'Mollejo M', 'George TI', 'Zanotti R', 'Orfao A', 'Escribano L', 'Sanchez-Munoz L']","['Instituto de Estudios de Mastocitosis de Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; Red Espanola de Mastocitosis, Toledo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130920,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD30', 'WHO', 'bone marrow', 'flow cytometry', 'mastocytosis']",2013/10/12 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2013/10/12 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/his.12221 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2013 Dec;63(6):780-7. doi: 10.1111/his.12221.

It has been recognized that this may easily lead to a problematic mismatch between the developers' idea of the system and requirements from clinical practice. In this paper, we will present an approach to reduce the complexity of constructing a CDS system. The approach is based on an ontological annotation of data resources, which improves standardization and the semantic processing of data. This, in turn, allows to use data mining tools to automatically create hypotheses for CDS models, which reduces the manual workload in the creation of a new model.

The HTLV-1 genome encodes the Tax protein that plays essential regulatory roles in HTLV-1 replication and oncogenic transformation of T lymphocytes. Despite intensive study of Tax, how Tax interfaces with host signaling pathways to regulate virus replication and drive T-cell proliferation and immortalization remains poorly understood. To gain new insight into the mechanisms of Tax function and regulation, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify novel cellular Tax-interacting proteins. This screen identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a new binding partner of Tax. The interaction between HSP90 and Tax was validated by coimmunoprecipitation assays, and colocalization between the two proteins was observed by confocal microscopy. Treatment of HTLV-1-transformed cells with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG elicited proteasomal degradation of Tax in the nuclear matrix with concomitant inhibition of NF-kappaB and HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activation. Knockdown of HSP90 by lentiviral shRNAs similarly provoked a loss of Tax protein in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Finally, treatment of HTLV-1-transformed cell lines with 17-DMAG suppressed HTLV-1 replication and promoted apoptotic cell death. Taken together, our results reveal that Tax is a novel HSP90 client protein and HSP90 inhibitors may exert therapeutic benefits for ATL and HAM/TSP patients.",,"['Gao, Linlin', 'Harhaj, Edward William']","['Gao L', 'Harhaj EW']","['Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131009,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Virus Replication']",,,2013/10/11 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/10/11 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02006-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02006-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Dec;87(24):13640-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02006-13.

NK cells express HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors and preferentially kill HLA class I(low) tumors or virus-infected cells. Killing occurs upon engagement of activating NKRs with ligands that are up-regulated on tumors and infected cells. A similar activating receptor/ligand interaction strategy is used by gammadelta T cells, which in addition, use their TCRs for recognition of phosphorylated antigens and still largely undefined ligands on tumor cells. In the haploidentical allo-HSCT setting, alloreactive NK cells, derived from donor HSCs, can exert potent antileukemia activity and kill residual patient DCs and T cells, thus preventing GvHD and graft rejection. However, generation of KIR(+) alloreactive NK cells from HSCs requires many weeks, during which leukemia relapses, and life-threatening infections may occur. Importantly, mature NK cells and gammadelta T cells can control certain infectious agents efficiently, in particular, limit CMV reactivation, and infusion of such donor cells at the time of HSCT has been implemented. Development of novel, cell-based immunotherapies, allowing improved trafficking and better targeting, will endow NK cells and gammadelta T lymphocytes with enhanced anti-tumor activity, also making them key reagents for therapies against solid tumors.

Recently, we demonstrated preferential DNA methylation of HOX genes in MCL compared with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), despite these genes not being expressed in either entity. Since EZH2 has been shown to regulate HOX gene expression, to gain further insight into its possible role in differential silencing of HOX genes in MCL vs. CLL, we performed detailed epigenetic characterization using representative cell lines and primary samples. We observed significant overexpression of EZH2 in MCL vs. CLL. Chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that EZH2 catalyzed repressive H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which was sufficient to silence HOX genes in CLL, whereas in MCL H3K27me3 is accompanied by DNA methylation for a more stable repression. More importantly, hypermethylation of the HOX genes in MCL resulted from EZH2 overexpression and subsequent recruitment of the DNA methylation machinery onto HOX gene promoters. The importance of EZH2 upregulation in this process was further underscored by siRNA transfection and EZH2 inhibitor experiments.

METHODS: A large SLE cohort was linked to cancer registries. We examined the types of non-lymphoma hematological cancers. RESULTS: In 16,409 patients, 115 hematological cancers [including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)] occurred. Among these, 33 were non-lymphoma. Of the 33 non-lymphoma cases, 13 were of lymphoid lineage: multiple myeloma (n = 5), plasmacytoma (n = 3), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL; n = 3), precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1) and unspecified lymphoid leukemia (n = 1). The remaining 20 cases were of myeloid lineage: MDS (n = 7), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 7), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 2) and 4 unspecified leukemias. Most of these malignancies occurred in female Caucasians, except for plasma cell neoplasms (4/5 multiple myeloma and 1/3 plasmacytoma cases occurred in blacks). CONCLUSIONS: In this large SLE cohort, the most common non-lymphoma hematological malignancies were myeloid types (MDS and AML). This is in contrast to the general population, where lymphoid types are 1.7 times more common than myeloid non-lymphoma hematological malignancies. Most (80%) multiple myeloma cases occurred in blacks; this requires further investigation.","['(c) 2013 S.

While remarkable progress has been made in characterizing genetic aberrations that may control these hematological disorders, it has also become clear that abnormalities in the bone marrow microenvironment might hit precursor cells and contribute to disease. However, responses of leukemic precursor cells to inflammatory conditions or microbial components upon infection are yet unexplored. Our previous work and increasing evidence indicate that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the earliest stages of lymphoid development in mice and humans provide an important mechanism for producing cells of the innate immune system. Using highly controlled co-culture systems, we now show that lymphoid precursors from leukemic bone marrow express TLRs and respond to their ligation by changing cell differentiation patterns. While no apparent contribution of TLR signals to tumor progression was recorded for any of the investigated diseases, the replenishment of innate cells was consistently promoted upon in vitro TLR exposure, suggesting that early recognition of pathogen-associated molecules might be implicated in the regulation of hematopoietic cell fate decisions in childhood acute leukemia.",,"['Dorantes-Acosta, Elisa', 'Vadillo, Eduardo', 'Contreras-Quiroz, Adriana', 'Balandran, Juan Carlos', 'Arriaga-Pizano, Lourdes', 'Purizaca, Jessica', 'Huerta-Yepez, Sara', 'Jimenez, Elva', 'Aguilera, Wendy', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Mayani, Hector', 'Pelayo, Rosana']","['Dorantes-Acosta E', 'Vadillo E', 'Contreras-Quiroz A', 'Balandran JC', 'Arriaga-Pizano L', 'Purizaca J', 'Huerta-Yepez S', 'Jimenez E', 'Aguilera W', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Mayani H', 'Pelayo R']","[""Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Mexican Institute for Social Security, Avenue Cuauhtemoc 330, Colonia Doctores, 06720 Mexico City, Mexico ; Federico Gomez Children's Hospital, 06720 Mexico City, Mexico ; Medical Sciences Program, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 04510 Mexico City, Mexico.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130910,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,['0 (Toll-Like Receptors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*biosynthesis']",,,2013/10/10 06:00,2014/06/04 06:00,['2013/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/846724 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:846724. doi: 10.1155/2013/846724.

A 6-year-old boy was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of 15 months due to recurrent respiratory infections, diarrhea and therapeutic response to pancreatic enzymes. Three sweat tests were negative. At the age of 5 years, he began to experience pain in the lower limbs, laxity of joints, lameness and frequent falls. A radiological study revealed metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. A complete blood cell count showed leukopenia (leukocytes: 3.1-3.5 x 10(3)/microL), neutropenia (segmented neutrophils: 15-22%), but normal hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count. A molecular study revealed biallelic mutations in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome gene (183-184TA-CT K62X in exon 2 and a 258+2T-C transition) confirming the diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. A non-pathologic, silent nucleotide A to G transition at position 201 was also found in heterozygosis in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome gene. This is the first report to describe a Brazilian child with molecular diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, intermittent or persistent neutropenia and skeletal changes. Other characteristics include immune system, hepatic and cardiac changes and predisposition to leukemia. Recurrent bacterial, viral and fungal infections are common.

However, its antitumor effect in thyroid cancer remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to test the therapeutic potential of shikonin for thyroid cancer and explore the mechanisms underlying antitumor effects of shikonin. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the effects of shikonin on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and xenograft tumor growth in thyroid cancer cells and the effect of shikonin on proliferation of primary thyroid cancer cells. RESULTS: Shikonin inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced cell cycle arrest. Moreover, shikonin induced cell apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-mediated DNA damage and activation of the p53 signaling pathway. Our data also showed that shikonin dramatically inhibited thyroid cancer cell migration and invasion by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and downregulating expression of Slug and MMP-2, -9, and -14. Further elucidation of the mechanisms involved revealed that shikonin markedly repressed the phosphorylation of Erk and Akt and activated the p16/Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway in thyroid cancer cells. Growth of xenograft tumors derived from the thyroid cancer cell line FTC133 in nude mice was significantly inhibited by shikonin. Importantly, we did not find the effect of shikonin on liver function in mice. CONCLUSION: We for the first time demonstrated that shikonin is a potentially effective antitumor agent for thyroid cancers.",,"['Yang, Qi', 'Ji, Meiju', 'Guan, Haixia', 'Shi, Bingyin', 'Hou, Peng']","['Yang Q', 'Ji M', 'Guan H', 'Shi B', 'Hou P']","[""PhD, Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Xi'an 710061, People's Republic of China. phou@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131008,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*agonists/metabolism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Liver/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutant Proteins/agonists/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Proteins/agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*agonists/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2013/10/10 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2013/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jc.2013-2583 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2013-2583 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2013 Dec;98(12):E1909-17. doi: 10.1210/jc.2013-2583.

Galpha12/13 subunits are known to activate the regulator of G-protein signaling-like family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), which includes PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG) and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). However, their contributions to Ca(2+)-sensitized force are not well understood. Using permeabilized blood vessels from PRG(-/-) mice and a new method to silence LARG in organ-cultured blood vessels, we show that both RhoGEFs are activated by the physiologically and pathophysiologically important thromboxane A2 and endothelin-1 receptors. The co-activation is the result of direct and independent activation of both RhoGEFs as well as their co-recruitment due to heterodimerization. The isolated recombinant C-terminal domain of PRG, which is responsible for heterodimerization with LARG, strongly inhibited Ca(2+)-sensitized force. We used photolysis of caged phenylephrine, caged guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) in solution, and caged GTPgammaS or caged GTP loaded on the RhoA.RhoGDI complex to show that the recruitment and activation of RhoGEFs is the cause of a significant time lag between the initial Ca(2+) transient and phasic force components and the onset of Ca(2+)-sensitized force.",,"['Artamonov, Mykhaylo V', 'Momotani, Ko', 'Stevenson, Andra', 'Trentham, David R', 'Derewenda, Urszula', 'Derewenda, Zygmunt S', 'Read, Paul W', 'Gutkind, J Silvio', 'Somlyo, Avril V']","['Artamonov MV', 'Momotani K', 'Stevenson A', 'Trentham DR', 'Derewenda U', 'Derewenda ZS', 'Read PW', 'Gutkind JS', 'Somlyo AV']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Merck Research Laboratories, Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033.', ""The Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Biomedical Sciences, King's College London, London SE1 1UK, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908.', 'Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908.

CD16B is highly homologous to CD16A and a major FcgammaR on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). We show here that glycoengineered obinutuzumab or rituximab bound CD16B with approximately sevenfold higher affinity, compared with nonglycoengineered wild-type parental antibodies. Furthermore, glycoengineered obinutuzumab activated PMNs, either purified or in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia whole blood, more efficiently than wild-type rituximab. Activation resulted in a 50% increase in CD11b expression and 70% down-modulation of CD62L on neutrophils and in release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. Activation was not accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, but led to up to 47% phagocytosis of glycoengineered anti-CD20 opsonized chronic lymphoblastic leukemia targets by purified PMNs. Significant phagocytosis was observed in whole blood, but only in the presence of glycoengineered antibodies, and was followed by up to 50% PMN death. Finally we show, using anti-CD16B and anti-CD32A Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, that both of these receptors are involved in PMN activation, phagocytosis, and cell death induced by glycoengineered antibodies. We conclude that phagocytosis by PMNs is an additional mechanism of action of obinutuzumab mediated through its higher binding affinity for CD16B.",,"['Golay, Josee', 'Da Roit, Fabio', 'Bologna, Luca', 'Ferrara, Claudia', 'Leusen, Jeanette H', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Klein, Christian', 'Introna, Martino']","['Golay J', 'Da Roit F', 'Bologna L', 'Ferrara C', 'Leusen JH', 'Rambaldi A', 'Klein C', 'Introna M']","['Center of Cellular Therapy ""G.

Here, an approach using HA-coated chitosan (CS)-triphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles is investigated, using CS with different molecular weight (25 and 684 kDa), which influences HA presentation, and enzymatic and pH stability. In a study of nuclease stability, post-digestion of nanoparticles with chitosanase reveals that pDNA is at least partially degraded by DNAse; this may suggest that literature results overestimate the polyplex stability against nucleases. Using cells with a significantly different CD44 expression (RAW 264.7 macrophages-high levels; K562 leukemia cells-low levels; Kelly neuroblastoma cells-absent), the selectivity of CD44-mediated transfection is proven. Further, using luciferase pDNA and then later anti-luc siRNA, low MW CS-based nanoparticles show the best results despite a lower internalization efficiency; this effect is ascribed to a more efficient endosomal disruption and nucleic acid de-complexation.","['(c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

All 11 patients (100%) were cured of their invasive fungal sinonasal disease without relapse. Three patients eventually died from unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal sinonasal disease is a life-threatening problem in immunocompromised children, especially with relapsed leukemia. Successful treatment depends on timely and aggressive surgical, antifungal, and supportive therapies. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest series of pediatric patients with invasive fungal sinonasal disease managed via an aggressive surgical approach with the best outcomes to date.

Defined deprotection steps led, in good yields, to the final target compounds that carry, in position 3, either ester, acid, or amide functions. Thus, a series of novel quinolone nucleoside derivatives was obtained via a convergent synthesis route.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the appropriate dose of PegIFNa2a has not been established to date. METHODS: In the French SPIRIT trial, the authors compared 2 initial doses of PegIFNa2a, taking into account an amendment that recommended reducing that dose from 90 mug/week to 45 mug/week because of toxicities. Accordingly, 2 subgroups of patients were identified: the PegIFN90 group (171 patients who were treated with the 90-mug/week dose) and the PegIFN45 group (50 patients who were treated with the 45-mug/week dose). Both groups were compared for toxicity and efficacy. RESULTS: PegIFNa2a at a dose of 90 mug/week resulted in a rate of 54% of grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity compared with 27% with the dose of 45 mug/week (P < .001), leading to discontinuation rates of 40% and 10%, respectively, before 6 months. The dose reduction did not significantly affect the efficacy of the combination. By 12 months, the cumulative molecular response rates (ie, BCR-ABL/abl </= 0.01 [IS: molecular responses graded as molecular response 4 (MR4)]) were 14% and 25%, respectively, for the subgroup treated with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and the PegIFN90 subgroup. After the amendment, the MR4 rates were 10% and 28%, respectively, for the subgroup treated with imatinib at the 400-mg dose and PegIFN45 subgroup (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that in combination with imatinib, the efficient dose of PegIFNa2a appears to be 45 mug/week.

The common practice is to admit the patient to hospital and treat him or her empirically with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Oral therapy could be an alternative approach for selected patients. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic cancer patients. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 4, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 4) and LILACS (1982 to 2007). We searched several databases for ongoing trials. We checked the conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) (1995 to 2007), and all references of included studies and major reviews were scanned. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotic(s) to intravenous antibiotic(s) for the treatment of neutropenic cancer patients with fever. The comparison between the two could be started initially (initial oral) or following an initial course of intravenous antibiotic treatment (sequential). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. Data concerning mortality, treatment failures and adverse events were extracted from the included studies assuming an 'intention-to-treat' basis for the outcome measures whenever possible. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for dichotomous data. Risk of bias assessment was also made in line with methodology of The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two trials (3142 episodes in 2372 patients) were included in the analyses. The mortality rate was similar when comparing oral to intravenous antibiotic treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.68, 9 trials, 1392 patients, median mortality 0, range 0% to 8.8%). Treatment failure rates were also similar (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, all trials). No significant heterogeneity was shown for all comparisons but adverse events. The effect was stable in a wide range of patients. Quinolones alone or combined with another antibiotic were used with comparable results. Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, were more common with oral antibiotics. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present data, oral treatment is an acceptable alternative to intravenous antibiotic treatment in febrile neutropenic cancer patients (excluding patients with acute leukaemia) who are haemodynamically stable, without organ failure, and do not have pneumonia, infection of a central line or a severe soft-tissue infection. The wide CI for mortality allows the present use of oral treatment in groups of patients with an expected low risk for mortality, and further research should be aimed at clarifying the definition of low risk patients.",,"['Vidal, Liat', 'Ben Dor, Itsik', 'Paul, Mical', 'Eliakim-Raz, Noa', 'Pokroy, Ellisheva', 'Soares-Weiser, Karla', 'Leibovici, Leonard']","['Vidal L', 'Ben Dor I', 'Paul M', 'Eliakim-Raz N', 'Pokroy E', 'Soares-Weiser K', 'Leibovici L']","['Department of Medicine E, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, 39 Jabotinski Street, Petah Tikva, Israel, 49100.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20131009,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Failure']",,,2013/10/10 06:00,2014/04/29 06:00,['2013/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD003992.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Oct 9;(10):CD003992. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD003992.pub3.,PMC6457615,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2004;(4):CD003992.

Additional epidemiological data are, however, still awaited for providing a lifelong overview of potential cancer risks. This paper gives predictions of potential lifetime risks of cancer incidence that would be induced by CT examinations during childhood in French routine practices in pediatrics. Organ doses were estimated from standard radiological protocols in 15 hospitals. Excess risks of leukemia, brain/central nervous system, breast and thyroid cancers were predicted from dose-response models estimated in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors' dataset and studies of medical exposures. Uncertainty in predictions was quantified using Monte Carlo simulations. This approach predicts that 100,000 skull/brain scans in 5-year-old children would result in eight (90 % uncertainty interval (UI) 1-55) brain/CNS cancers and four (90 % UI 1-14) cases of leukemia and that 100,000 chest scans would lead to 31 (90 % UI 9-101) thyroid cancers, 55 (90 % UI 20-158) breast cancers, and one (90 % UI <0.1-4) leukemia case (all in excess of risks without exposure). Compared to background risks, radiation-induced risks would be low for individuals throughout life, but relative risks would be highest in the first decades of life. Heterogeneity in the radiological protocols across the hospitals implies that 5-10 % of CT examinations would be related to risks 1.4-3.6 times higher than those for the median doses. Overall excess relative risks in exposed populations would be 1-10 % depending on the site of cancer and the duration of follow-up. The results emphasize the potential risks of cancer specifically from standard CT examinations in pediatrics and underline the necessity of optimization of radiological protocols.",,"['Journy, Neige', 'Ancelet, Sophie', 'Rehel, Jean-Luc', 'Mezzarobba, Myriam', 'Aubert, Bernard', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Bernier, Marie-Odile']","['Journy N', 'Ancelet S', 'Rehel JL', 'Mezzarobba M', 'Aubert B', 'Laurier D', 'Bernier MO']","['Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131009,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects', 'Uncertainty']",,,2013/10/10 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2013/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-013-0491-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2014 Mar;53(1):39-54. doi: 10.1007/s00411-013-0491-8.

METHODS: Outcomes were compared of 517 AYAs with AML aged 16 to 21 years who were treated on Children's Oncology Group (COG), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) frontline AML trials from 1986 to 2008. RESULTS: There was a significant age difference between AYA cohorts in the COG, CALGB, and SWOG trials (median, 17.2 versus 20.1 versus 19.8 years, P < .001). The 10-year event-free survival of the COG cohort was superior to the combined adult cohorts (38% +/- 6% versus 23% +/- 6%, log-rank P = .006) as was overall survival (45% +/- 6% versus 34% +/- 7%), with a 10-year estimate comparison of P = .026. However, the younger age of the COG cohort is confounding, with all patients aged 16 to 18 years doing better than those aged 19 to 21 years. Although the 10-year relapse rate was lower for the COG patients (29% +/- 6% versus 57% +/- 8%, Gray's P < .001), this was offset by a higher postremission treatment-related mortality of 26% +/- 6% versus 12% +/- 6% (Gray's P < .001). Significant improvements in 10-year event-free survival and overall survival were observed for the entire cohort in later studies.

It is the most common form of leukemia in the western world (incidence 3-5/100 000). Elderly people are mainly affected, median age at diagnosis is around 70 years and there is a slight predominance in men. The etiology of the disease is unknown. The initial symptoms are nonspecific. Cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly followed by general fatigue are seen most commonly. Other possible symptoms include night sweats, fever, loss of weight (so-called B symptoms) and frequent infections. Several patients develop autoimmune complications as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). To confirm the diagnosis more than 5000 B-lymphocytes/microl need to be present. The expression of the typical surface markers CD5, CD19, and CD23 has to be confirmed by flow cytometry. Imaging studies as X-ray of the chest, ultrasound of the abdomen, or CT scan are used to assess the degree of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy is not mandatory for the diagnosis. According to the European Binet staging system, CLL is divided into 3 stages (A, B and C). Patients in Binet stage A have 0 to 2 areas of node or organ enlargement with normal levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage B patients have 3 to 5 areas of node or organ enlargement and normal or slightly decreased levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage C patients have anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dl) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 100 000/microl), with or without lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. As there is no survival benefit associated with early intervention, asymptomatic patients with early stage CLL (Binet stage A and B) are usually not treated but are followed on a ""watch and wait"" principle. Treatment indications include stage Binet C or signs of an active disease as rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly together with physical limitation, B symptoms that cannot be tolerated, rapidly deteriorating blood values, or rapidly increasing leukocyte counts. The patient's physical condition has major impact on the treatment decision. Currently immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and the CD20-antibody rituximab (FCR) is the standard of care in previously untreated and physically fit CLL-patients. An alternative regimen is the combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR). Physically compromised patients can be treated with the oral drug chlorambucil or with bendamustine with or without rituximab. Due to high morbidity and mortality, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is limited to a small group of patients and should be discussed in a high-risk situation, such as 17p deletion, lack of response to standard therapy or early relapse.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

In order to more accurately characterize relative survival and other outcomes of AYA patients, a cross-study analysis was conducted using data from recent trials conducted by the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) and Children's Oncology Group (COG). METHODS: Data were combined from the CCG-2891, CCG-2941, CCG-2961, and AAML03P1 trials. The data set included 1840 patients, comprising 238 AYA and 1602 younger patients. RESULTS: Overall survival was not significantly different in the 2 groups (AYA, 49% +/- 7% versus younger, 54% +/- 3% (+/- 2 standard errors), P = .058). Relapse was lower in AYA patients (30% +/- 7% versus 41% +/- 3%, P = .002), but treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher (25% +/- 6% versus 12% +/- 2%, P < .001). After adjustment for other factors, older age remained strongly associated with TRM (hazard ratio = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.59-3.33, P < .001). Infection accounted for the excess TRM in AYA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Survival in AYA and younger patients with newly diagnosed AML is similar; however, older patients are at higher risk for TRM. More effective strategies for preventing mortality from infection in AYA patients are needed.",['(c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],"['Canner, Jason', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Franklin, Janet', 'Freyer, David R', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Woods, William G', 'Perentesis, John', 'Horan, John']","['Canner J', 'Alonzo TA', 'Franklin J', 'Freyer DR', 'Gamis A', 'Gerbing RB', 'Lange BJ', 'Meshinchi S', 'Woods WG', 'Perentesis J', 'Horan J']","[""Advocate Hope Children's Hospital, Oak Lawn, Illinois.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130919,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'adolescent and young adult', 'cancer', 'children', 'infection']",2013/10/10 06:00,2014/01/17 06:00,['2013/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28342 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Dec 1;119(23):4162-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28342.

MiR187 was overexpressed in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and associated with high Ki67 expression, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, advanced International Prognostic Index and poor prognosis of patients. In vitro, ectopic expression of miR187 in T-lymphoma cell lines accelerated tumor cell proliferation, whereas treatment with miR187 inhibitor reduced cell growth. MiR187 downregulated tumor suppressor gene disabled homolog-2 (Dab2), decreased the interaction of Dab2 with adapter protein Grb2, resulting in Ras activation, phosphorylation/activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT, and subsequent stabilization of MYC oncoprotein. MiR187-overexpressing cells were resistant to chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and gemcitabine, but sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Bortezomib inhibited T-lymphoma cell proliferation by downregulating miR187, dephosphorylating ERK and AKT and degrading MYC. In a murine xenograft model established with subcutaneous injection of Jurkat cells, bortezomib particularly retarded the growth of miR187-overexpressing tumors, consistent with the downregulation of miR187, Ki67 and MYC expression. Collectively, these findings indicated that miR187 was related to tumor progression in PTCL-NOS through modulating Ras-mediated ERK/AKT/MYC axis. Although potentially oncogenic, miR187 indicated the sensitivity of T-lymphoma cells to bortezomib.

We evaluated the relative roles of cell count and the surface expression of tissue factor (TF) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the procoagulant phenotype of AML cell lines. The TF-positive AML M3 cell lines, NB4 and HL60, and AML M2 cell line, AML14, exhibited both extrinsic tenase and prothrombinase activity in a purified system and promoted experimental thrombus formation. In contrast, the TF-negative AML cell line, HEL, exhibited only prothrombinase activity and did not affect the rate of occlusive thrombus formation. In plasma, NB4, HL60 and AML14 shortened clotting times in a cell-count, PS- and TF-dependent manner. Exposure of cultured NB4, HL60, and AML14 cells to the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin increased their extrinsic tenase activity and PS expression.

METHODS: The methylation status of miR-203 promoter CpG islands was detected with methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The expression of miR-203 was detected by Taqman real- time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. And the clinical significance of miR-203 in pediatric acute leukemia (ALL) was also analyzed. RESULTS: The promoter of miR-203 was unmethylated in all of 31 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, all of 15 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and all of 23 controls. The relative expression levels of miR-203 in controls, pediatric acute leukemia, ALL and AML were 16.93+/-6.31, 48.97+/-10.38, 55.88+/-12.91, 24.28+/-9.10 respectively. The results indicated that miR-203 was significantly up- regulated in pediatric acute leukemia (P=0.011) and ALL (P=0.009), not in pediatric AML (P=0.514) compared with control. The expression of miR-203 was significantly related with the gender, immunophenotype, chromosome, fusion gene, BCR-ABL, SIL-TAL1 and prednisone experiment in pediatric ALL and the gender, chromosome, fusion gene, SIL-TAL1 in pediatric acute leukemia (P<0.05). And in risk stratification pairwise comparisons, the expression of miR-203 in the medium-risk and high-risk groups appeared significantly different (P=0.022). CONCLUSION: miR-203 may not be regulated with methylation mechanism in pediatric acute leukemia. miR- 203 may be a protooncogene involved in the formation of pediatric acute leukemia and ALL.

METHODS: 69 patients with CML while taking IM were enrolled and a total of 86 peripheral blood samples were detected. The levels of total triiodothyronine (TT3), total tetraiodothyronine (TT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), testosterone, progesterone, estradiol (E2), plasma total cortisol (PTC) at 8:00-10:00 am measured. Concentration of hormones in different groups were measured to evaluate the effects of IM on endocrine system and relationships with its administration duration, plasma concentration and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: (1) Of the 7 types of hormones, an elevation of TSH level was found in 14 patients (20.3%), a decrease of TT3 and testosterone in 8 patients (11.6%) and 8 males (18.6%), respectively. (2) A significant decline of TT3 and testosterone was observed in all patients divided by different administration duration.

METHODS: The cell survival, differentiation and apoptosis rates were tested by MTT or flow cytometry analysis after Kasumi-1 cells were treated by DMSO, DEX (20 nmol/L), vorinostat (1 mumol/L) or DEX (20 nmol/L) in combination with vorinostat (1 mumol/L). WB and IP-WB were performed to detect AML1-ETO and its ubiquitination. RESULTS: Treatment with the combination of DEX and vorinostat for 48 h led to statistically significant differences of inhibited proliferation [(42.06+/-8.20)%], increased differentiation [(52.83+/-8.97)%] and apoptosis [(52.92+/-2.53)%] of Kasumi-1 cells when compared with vorinostat [(33.82+/-9.41)%, (43.93+/-9.04)% and (42.98+/-3.01)%, respectively], DEX [(17.30+/-3.49)%, (22.53+/-4.51)% and (19.57+/-2.17)%, respectively] or control [(6.96+/-0.39)%, (21.73+/-2.03)% and (6.96+/-0.39)%, respectively]. Also significant ubiquitination and decreased AML1-ETO protein in Kasumi-1 cells after the combination treatment over single agent or control were observed.

Whole genome/exome sequencing has disclosed the genetic landscape of several hematologic tumors, providing comprehensive catalogs of somatic mutations and new insights into the genes that contribute to cellular transformation. Thanks to these technical progresses, research on the molecular pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has also advanced at a sustained pace in recent times revealing NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3, and MYD88 as the most recurrently (>5%) mutated genes that have been identified in CLL. Beside mutations of cancer related genes, another mechanism involved in disease initiation and progression of mature B-cell tumors, including CLL, is represented by B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. The BCR plays a central role in disease pathogenesis and, consequently, BCR signaling might represent a suitable target for therapy in many patients. Currently, the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, which acts downstream the BCR signaling pathway, appears to be particularly promising and shows important clinical activity in CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein we report in silico modelling based development of a novel, protein-vorinostat nanomedicine exhibiting selective and superior anti-leukemic activity against heterogeneous population of AML patient samples (n=9), including refractory and relapsed cases, and three representative cell lines expressing CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cell phenotype (KG-1a), promyelocytic phenotype (HL-60) and FLT3-ITD mutation (MV4-11). Nano-vorinostat having ~100nm size exhibited enhanced cellular uptake rendering significantly lower IC50 in AML cell lines and patient samples, and induced enhanced HDAC inhibition, oxidative injury, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis compared to free vorinostat. Most importantly, nanomedicine showed exceptional single-agent activity against the clonogenic proliferative capability of bone marrow derived leukemic progenitors, while remaining non-toxic to healthy bone marrow cells. Collectively, this epigenetics targeted nanomedicine appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy against various French-American-British (FAB) classes of AML.

Ultrasound imaging may be helpful in the exclusion of other disorders in patients with suspected VOD (SOS) (1C). It is recommended that liver biopsy be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis of VOD (SOS) is unclear and there is a need to exclude other diagnoses (1C). It is recommended that liver biopsies are undertaken using the transjugular approach in order to reduce the risks associated with the procedure (1C). It is suggested that the role of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels remains an area for further research but that these levels should not form part of the routine diagnostic work-up for VOD (SOS) at present (2C). RISK FACTORS: It is recommended that patients are assessed for risk factors for VOD (SOS) and that these risk factors are addressed prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (1A). PROPHYLAXIS: Defibrotide is recommended at a dose of 6.25 mg/kg intravenously four times daily for the prevention of VOD (SOS) in children undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation with the following risk factors: pre-existing hepatic disease, second myeloablative transplant, allogeneic transplant for leukaemia beyond second relapse, conditioning with busulfan-containing regimens, prior treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, diagnosis of primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, adrenoleucodystrophy or osteopetrosis (1A). Defibrotide is suggested at a dose of 6.25 mg/kg intravenously four times daily for the prevention of VOD (SOS) in adults undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation with the following risk factors: pre-existing hepatic disease, second myeloablative transplant, allogeneic transplant for leukaemia beyond second relapse, conditioning with busulfan-containing regimens, prior treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, diagnosis of primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, adrenoleucodystrophy or osteopetrosis (2B). Prostaglandin E1 is not recommended in the prophylaxis of VOD (SOS) due to lack of efficacy and toxicity (1B). Pentoxifylline is not recommended in the prophylaxis of VOD (SOS) due to lack of efficacy (1A). Ursodeoxycholic acid is suggested for use in the prophylaxis of VOD (SOS) (2C). Heparin (unfractionated and low molecular weight) is not suggested for use in the prophylaxis of VOD (SOS) due to the risk of increased toxicity (2B). Antithrombin is not suggested for the prophylaxis of VOD (SOS) due to lack of efficacy (2B). TREATMENT: Defibrotide is recommended in the treatment of VOD (SOS) in adults and children (1B). Tissue plasminogen activator is not recommended for use in the treatment of VOD (SOS) due to the associated risk of haemorrhage (1B). N-acetylcysteine is not routinely recommended for use in the treatment of veno-occlusive disease due to lack of efficacy (1A). Methylprednisolone may be considered for use in the treatment of veno-occlusive disease with the appropriate caveats of caution regarding infection (2C). Judicious clinical care, particularly in the management of fluid balance, is recommended in the management of VOD (SOS) (1C). Early discussion with critical care specialists and a specialist hepatology unit is recommended in the management of VOD (SOS) and other treatment options including transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or hepatic transplantation may be considered (1C). SUMMARY: A joint working group established by the Haemato-oncology subgroup of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and the British Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) has reviewed the available literature and made recommendations for the diagnosis and management of veno-occlusive disease of the liver following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

However, most established risk scores include mainly disease-related parameters and thus focus on leukaemia-transformation rather than survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To establish a risk score optimized for prediction of survival, we analysed international prognostic scoring system (IPSS)-related and IPSS-independent variables in 400 patients with primary MDS (median age: 71 years; range 18-91) of the Austrian MDS platform. Patients were randomly split into a learning sample (60%) and validation sample (40%). External validation was performed on 93 patients from the Heinrich Heine University (Duesseldorf/Germany). RESULTS: By multivariate analysis, IPSS, ferritin, age and comorbidities were found to be independent predictive variables concerning survival. Based on weighing these prognostic parameters against each other, we established a novel survival score employing IPSS, ferritin (< 900 ng/mL = 0; >/= 900 ng/mL = 1), age (< 70 years = 0; 70-79 years = 1; >/= 80 years = 1.5) and HCT-CI comorbidity (low/intermediate = 0; high = 0.5). Using this score, four prognostic risk groups could be discriminated in the validation sample, with highly significant differences in life expectancy [median survival: LowS (score 0), not reached; Int-1S (score 0.5-1.0), 3.84 years; Int-2S (score 1.5-2.0): 2.72 years; and HighS (score > 2.0): 0.80 years; P < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Our newly proposed score may be a useful tool for survival prediction in MDS and helpful in patient selection for various therapies in daily practice and clinical trials.","['(c) 2013 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal', 'Foundation.

Here we have used a new highly specific CDK9 inhibitor, LDC000067 to interrogate gene control mechanisms mediated by CDK9. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The selectivity of LDC000067 was established in functional kinase assays. Functions of CDK9 in gene expression were assessed with in vitro transcription experiments, single gene analyses and genome-wide expression profiling. Cultures of mouse embryonic stem cells, HeLa cells, several cancer cell lines, along with cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia were also used to investigate cellular responses to LDC000067. KEY RESULTS: The selectivity of LDC000067 for CDK9 over other CDKs exceeded that of the known inhibitors flavopiridol and DRB. LDC000067 inhibited in vitro transcription in an ATP-competitive and dose-dependent manner. Gene expression profiling of cells treated with LDC000067 demonstrated a selective reduction of short-lived mRNAs, including important regulators of proliferation and apoptosis. Analysis of de novo RNA synthesis suggested a wide ranging positive role of CDK9. At the molecular and cellular level, LDC000067 reproduced effects characteristic of CDK9 inhibition such as enhanced pausing of RNA polymerase II on genes and, most importantly, induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study provides a framework for the mechanistic understanding of cellular responses to CDK9 inhibition. LDC000067 represents a promising lead for the development of clinically useful, highly specific CDK9 inhibitors.",['(c) 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Albert, T K', 'Rigault, C', 'Eickhoff, J', 'Baumgart, K', 'Antrecht, C', 'Klebl, B', 'Mittler, G', 'Meisterernst, M']","['Albert TK', 'Rigault C', 'Eickhoff J', 'Baumgart K', 'Antrecht C', 'Klebl B', 'Mittler G', 'Meisterernst M']","['Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology (IMTB), Faculty of Medicine, Westfalian Wilhelms University Muenster (WWU), Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (3-((6-(2-methoxyphenyl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)phenyl)methane sulfonamide)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['CDK9', 'RNA polymerase II', 'cyclin-dependent kinase', 'gene expression', 'transcription']",2013/10/10 06:00,2014/08/20 06:00,['2013/10/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bph.12408 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2014 Jan;171(1):55-68. doi: 10.1111/bph.12408.,PMC3874696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using mouse genetics and a BCR-ABL model of CML, we observed cross talk between Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the interferon-regulatory factor 8 (Irf8). In normal hematopoiesis, activation of beta-catenin results in up-regulation of Irf8, which in turn limits oncogenic beta-catenin functions. Self-renewal and myeloproliferation become dependent on beta-catenin in Irf8-deficient animals that develop a CML-like disease. Combined Irf8 deletion and constitutive beta-catenin activation result in progression of CML into fatal blast crisis, elevated leukemic potential of BCR-ABL-induced LICs, and Imatinib resistance. Interestingly, activated beta-catenin enhances a preexisting Irf8-deficient gene signature, identifying beta-catenin as an amplifier of progression-specific gene regulation in the shift of CML to blast crisis.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 73-year-old male with a right-sided nasopharyngeal mass revealed on CT scan and MRI. RESULTS: An initial cytological and histological examination suggested a high-grade lymphoma. Nevertheless, the final diagnosis was a MS with an unusual involvement of the nasopharynx that was treated with a conventional induction leukemia therapy. Eight months later, the patient had persistent thrombocytopenia and a bone marrow aspiration showed the dysplasia of a high grade myelodysplastic syndrome and cytogenetics detected t(3;21). The patient was treated with a 5-Azacitidine (Vidaza) protocol until overt progression and disease evolution. CONCLUSION: In conclusion few cases of MS involving the nasopharynx have been reported. Its diagnosis is often difficult and should be considered especially when a high index of suspicion is present and the immunophenotype of the malignant haematological cells is not clearly in favour of a lymphoma.",,"['Raphael, Jacques', 'Valent, Alexander', 'Hanna, Colette', 'Auger, Nathalie', 'Casiraghi, Odile', 'Ribrag, Vincent', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Saada, Veronique']","['Raphael J', 'Valent A', 'Hanna C', 'Auger N', 'Casiraghi O', 'Ribrag V', 'De Botton S', 'Saada V']","['Clinical Haematology Department, Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR), 114 rue Edouard Vaillant, 94805, Villejuif, France, Raphaeljack13@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20131008,United States,Head Neck Pathol,Head and neck pathology,101304010,,IM,"['Aged', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/pathology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*pathology']",,,2013/10/09 06:00,2015/01/03 06:00,['2013/10/09 06:00'],"['2013/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12105-013-0495-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck Pathol. 2014 Jun;8(2):234-8. doi: 10.1007/s12105-013-0495-3.

In the present study, the effect of PML on regulating the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was explored. New downstream genes that may be responsible for the regulation of PML were found, and possible mechanisms were analyzed. The lentiviral vector which encodes full-length human PML cDNA or shRNA against PML was transfected into hMSCs. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect mRNA and protein expression. Flow cytometry was used to analyze apoptosis and the cell cycle distribution. Osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was induced by osteo-inductive medium for 7 to 14 days. cDNA microarray was used to scan the gene expression profile and to identify significant changes in gene expression. In the present study, we found that PML was stably expressed in hMSCs, and the expression was increased time-dependently along with cell osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of PML inhibited hMSC proliferation by inducing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle. However, PML enhanced the osteoblast differentiation potential of hMSCs. PML-overexpressing hMSCs had a significant increase in mineralized matrix production and ALP activity on day 7 under osteogenic or non-osteogenic differentiation conditions. Upregulation of integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP, bone sialoprotein) induced by PML overexpression was found.

Some patients cope very well; others almost seem to fail. Psychosocial variables are important factors for successful reintegration. Besides quality of life, resilience may help to understand the variance in individual differences in adaptation after alloSCT. METHODS: A pilot study at the University Hospital Muenster, Germany, assessed resilience in patients after alloSCT. The sample included 75 patients (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, aplastic anemia) aged 20-76 years. The instruments Resilience Scale RS-25, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, and EORTC QLQ-C30 were used. RESULTS: Resilience is positively correlated with quality of life (Spearman's rho 0.587) and social functioning (0.472), negatively with anxiety (-0.491) and depression (-0.577). Dividing the sample at the median resilience score of 144 reveals that high-resilience patients report less anxiety (p = 0.008) and depression (p < 0.001); higher physical (p = 0.041), emotional (p = 0.030), and social functioning (p = 0.003); and a better quality of life (p < 0.001) than low-resilience patients. No effects on resilience were found for age, gender, and primary disease entity. The high correlation of resilience and self-efficacy (r = 0.698) shows the strong relationship between the two concepts. Our results indicate a potential influence of the time span from alloSCT on patients' resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Resilience should be considered as a protective psychosocial factor for patients after alloSCT. A high degree of resilience can help patients to adapt to their situation and to resume their everyday life.",,"['Schumacher, Andrea', 'Sauerland, Cristina', 'Silling, Gerda', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Stelljes, Matthias']","['Schumacher A', 'Sauerland C', 'Silling G', 'Berdel WE', 'Stelljes M']","['Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Bldg.

The experimental design involved four groups of human T-lymphocyte leukaemic MOLT-4 cells: control, NU7441-treated (1 muM), IR-treated (1 Gy), and combination of NU7441 and IR. We used flow cytometry for apoptosis assessment, Western blotting and ELISA for detection of proteins involved in DNA repair signalling and epifluorescence microscopy for detection of IR-induced phosphorylation of histone H2A.X. We did not observe any major changes in the amount of DNA-PK subunits Ku70/80 caused by the combination of NU7441 and radiation. Their combination led to an increased phosphorylation of H2A.X, a hallmark of DNA damage. However, it did not prevent up-regulation of neither p53 (and its phosphorylation at Ser 15 and 392) nor p21. We observed a decrease in the levels of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, cdc25A phosphatase, cleavage of PARP and a significant increase in apoptosis in the group treated with combination. In conclusion, the combination of NU7441 with IR caused increased phosphorylation of H2A.X early after irradiation and subsequent induction of apoptosis. It was efficient in MOLT-4 cells in 10x lower concentration than the inhibitor NU7026.

However, a substantial number of patients develop resistance to imatinib treatment due to the emergence of clones carrying mutations in the protein BCR-ABL. The phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates various processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, and antiapoptosis activity. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor, using BCR-ABL-positive cell lines. Treatment with NVP-BEZ235 for 48 h inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis. The phosphorylation of the AKT kinase, eukaryotic initiation factor 4-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and p70 S6 kinase were decreased after NVP-BEZ235 treatment. The combination of NVP-BEZ235 with a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib, or nilotinib, induced a more pronounced colony growth inhibition, whereas the combination of NVP-BEZ235 and nilotinib was more effective in inducing apoptosis and reducing the phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and S6 kinase. NVP-BEZ235 in combination with nilotinib also inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model and inhibited the growth of primary T315I mutant cells and ponatinib-resistant cells.

APRIL significantly prolonged in vitro survival of CD5(+)B220(dull) leukemic cells derived from the murine Emu-TCL1-Tg (TCL1-Tg [transgenic]) model for CLL. APRIL-TCL1 double-Tg mice showed a significantly earlier onset of leukemia and disruption of splenic architecture, and survival was significantly reduced.

Bone morphogenetic proteins 2 (BMP2) and 4 (BMP4) regulate the fate and proliferation of normal hematopoietic stem cells, as well as interactions with their niche. We show here that the intrinsic expression of members of the BMP response pathway are deregulated in CML cells with differences exhibited in mature (CD34(-)) and immature (CD34(+)) compartments. These changes are accompanied by altered functional responses of primitive leukemic cells to BMP2 and BMP4 and strong increases in soluble BMP2 and BMP4 in the CML bone marrow. Using primary cells and a cell line mimicking CP-CML, we found that myeloid progenitor expansion is driven by the exposure of immature cells overexpressing BMP receptor Ib to BMP2 and BMP4. In summary, we demonstrate that deregulation of intracellular BMP signaling in primary CP-CML samples corrupts and amplifies their response to exogenous BMP2 and BMP4, which are abnormally abundant within the tumor microenvironment.

We used two kinds of leukemia cells (K562, U937) as main tumor cell models and cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spleen lymphocytes) separated from healthy ICR mice as normal cell models. The multivolume spectrophotometer system and fluorescence spectrophotometer were used to determine the spectral characteristics of DVDMS. The uptake of DVDMS by tumor cells and normal cells was measured by flow cytometry. The MTT assay was used to examine the cytotoxicity and sonotoxicity of DVDMS. The absorption spectra showed that DVDMS had five distinct peaks at 359, 514, 548, 580, and 631 nm, respectively, and the maximum peak was at approximately 359 nm. The fluorescence emission spectra showed that DVDMS fluorescence emission was at 642 nm. DVDMS showed an advantage of quick cellular uptake and selectively accumulated in tumor cells compared with normal healthy cells. The cytotoxicity of DVDMS by the MTT method was dose dependent, and DVDMS had little cytotoxicity to normal cells. The sonotoxicity of DVDMS showed that in the presence of DVDMS, under appropriate conditions, the cell-damaging effect of ultrasound was significantly enhanced.

Earlier studies identified the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine produced by uterine glands, as an essential regulator of implantation. LIF, acting via its cell surface receptor, activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the uterine epithelial cells. However, the precise mechanism via which activated STAT3 promotes uterine function during implantation remains unknown. To identify the molecular pathways regulated by STAT3, we created SW(d/d) mice in which Stat3 gene is conditionally inactivated in uterine epithelium. The SW(d/d) mice are infertile due to a lack of embryo attachment to the uterine luminal epithelium and consequent implantation failure. Gene expression profiling of uterine epithelial cells of SW(d/d) mice revealed dysregulated expression of specific components of junctional complexes, including E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin, and several claudins, which critically regulate epithelial junctional integrity and embryo attachment. In addition, uteri of SW(d/d) mice exhibited markedly reduced stromal proliferation and differentiation, indicating that epithelial STAT3 controls stromal function via a paracrine mechanism. The stromal defect arose from a drastic reduction in the production of several members of the epidermal growth factor family in luminal epithelium of SW(d/d) uteri and the resulting lack of activation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and mitotic activity in the stromal cells. Collectively, our results uncovered an intricate molecular network operating downstream of STAT3 that regulates uterine epithelial junctional reorganization, and stromal proliferation, and differentiation, which are critical determinants of successful implantation.",,"['Pawar, Sandeep', 'Starosvetsky, Elina', 'Orvis, Grant D', 'Behringer, Richard R', 'Bagchi, Indrani C', 'Bagchi, Milan K']","['Pawar S', 'Starosvetsky E', 'Orvis GD', 'Behringer RR', 'Bagchi IC', 'Bagchi MK']","['PhD, Professor and Head, Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, 534 Burrill Hall, 407 South Goodwin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801. mbagchi@life.illinois.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131007,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Decidua/drug effects/metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Infertility, Female/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Uterus/drug effects/*metabolism']",,,2013/10/09 06:00,2014/08/07 06:00,['2013/10/09 06:00'],"['2013/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2013-1206 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2013-1206 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2013 Dec;27(12):1996-2012. doi: 10.1210/me.2013-1206.

PRC2 methylates histone H3 on lysine-27 and is conserved from plants to flies to humans. In Drosophila melanogaster, PRC2 contains four core subunits: E(Z), SU(Z)12, ESC, and NURF55. E(Z) bears a SET domain that houses the enzyme active site. However, PRC2 activity depends upon critical inputs from SU(Z)12 and ESC. The stimulatory mechanisms are not understood. We present here functional dissection of the SU(Z)12 subunit. SU(Z)12 contains two highly conserved domains: an approximately 140-amino-acid VEFS domain and a Cys2-His2 zinc finger (ZnF). Analysis of recombinant PRC2 bearing VEFS domain alterations, including some modeled after leukemia mutations, identifies distinct elements needed for SU(Z)12 assembly with E(Z) and stimulation of histone methyltransferase. The results define an extensive VEFS subdomain that organizes the SU(Z)12-E(Z) interface. Although the SU(Z)12 ZnF is not needed for methyltransferase in vitro, genetic rescue assays show that the ZnF is required in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitations reveal that this ZnF facilitates PRC2 binding to a genomic target. This study defines functionally critical SU(Z)12 elements, including key determinants of SU(Z)12-E(Z) communication.

Here, we explored the role of Tgif1 in murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. CFU assays showed that Tgif1(-/-) bone marrow cells produced more total colonies and had higher serial CFU potential. These effects were also observed in vivo, where Tgif1(-/-) bone marrow cells had higher repopulation potential in short- and long-term competitive repopulation assays than wild-type cells. Serial transplantation and replating studies showed that Tgif1(-/-) HSCs exhibited greater self-renewal and were less proliferative and more quiescent than wild-type cells, suggesting that Tgif1 is required for stem cells to enter the cell cycle. Furthermore, HSCs from Tgif1(+/-) mice had a phenotype similar to that of HSCs from Tgif1(-/-) mice, while bone marrow cells with overexpressing Tgif1 showed increased proliferation and lower survival in long-term transplant studies.

Knockdown of alpha(3) subunit significantly inhibited cell apoptosis suggesting a crucial role of the alpha(3) subunit. Reevesioside F induced a rapid down-regulation of survivin protein, followed by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Further examination demonstrated the mitochondrial damage in leukemic cells through Mcl-1 down-regulation, Noxa up-regulation and an increase of the formation of truncated Bid, tBim and a 23-kDa cleaved Bcl-2 fragment. Furthermore, reevesioside F induced an increase of mitochondria-associated acetyl alpha-tubulin that may also contribute to apoptosis. The caspase cascade was profoundly activated by reevesioside F. Notably, the specific caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk significantly blunted reevesioside F-induced loss of DeltaPsim and apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-3 activation may further amplify mitochondrial damage and apoptotic signaling cascade. In spite of being a cardiac glycoside, reevesioside F did not increase the intracellular Ca(2)(+) levels. Moreover, CGP-37157 which blocked Na(+)/Ca(2)(+) exchanger on plasma membrane and mitochondria did not modify reevesioside F-mediated effect. In summary, the data suggest that reevesioside F induces apoptosis through the down-regulation of survivin and Mcl-1, and the formation of pro-apoptotic fragments from Bcl-2 family members. The loss of DeltaPsim and mitochondrial damage are responsible for the activation of caspases. Moreover, the amplification of caspase-3-mediated signaling pathway contributes largely to the execution of apoptosis in leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the widespread use of these oral therapies, little is known about the impact of different treatment regimens on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among CML patients. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of patient-reported treatment restrictions and negative medication experiences (NMEs) on satisfaction and other health outcomes among patients with CML treated with oral TKIs. METHODS: Participants recruited from survey panels and patient networks in the United States (US) and Europe completed an online questionnaire. Respondents included adults (>/= 18 years) with chronic-phase CML currently on TKI treatment. Study variables included treatment difficulty (i.e., difficulty in following treatment regimens), CML dietary/dosing requirements, NMEs, and validated PROs assessing treatment satisfaction, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), activity impairment, and non-adherence. Structural equation models assessed associations among variables, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: 303 patients with CML (US n=152; Europe n=151; mean age 51.5 years; 46.2% male) completed the questionnaire. Approximately 30% of patients reported treatment difficulties; treatment difficulty was higher among nilotinib (63.3%) than among dasatinib (2.6%) or imatinib (19.2%) treated patients (p<0.0001). Non-adherence was generally low; however, patients on nilotinib vs. imatinib reported missing doses more often (p<0.05). Treatment satisfaction was associated with significantly increased HRQoL (p<0.05) and lower activity impairment (p<0.01). NMEs were associated with decreased treatment satisfaction (p<0.01) and HRQoL (p<0.05), and greater activity impairment (p<0.01). Higher overall treatment restrictions were associated with greater treatment difficulty (p<0.001), which correlated with non-adherence (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment satisfaction and NMEs are important factors associated with HRQoL among patients with CML. Increased treatment restrictions and associated difficulty may affect adherence with TKIs. Choosing a CML treatment regimen that is simple and conveniently adaptable in patients' normal routine can be an important determinant of HRQoL and adherence.",,"['Hirji, Ishan', 'Gupta, Shaloo', 'Goren, Amir', 'Chirovsky, Diana R', 'Moadel, Alyson B', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Victor, Timothy W', 'Davis, Catherine C']","['Hirji I', 'Gupta S', 'Goren A', 'Chirovsky DR', 'Moadel AB', 'Olavarria E', 'Victor TW', 'Davis CC']","['Health Outcomes Practice, Kantar Health, Princeton, NJ, USA. shaloo.gupta@kantarhealth.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131008,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*adverse effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Patient Satisfaction', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Thiazoles/*adverse effects', 'United States']",,,2013/10/09 06:00,2014/07/25 06:00,['2013/10/09 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7525-11-167 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-11-167 [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2013 Oct 8;11:167. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-11-167.,PMC3851879,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several experimental and epidemiological evidences suggest that lignans may prevent human cancer in different organs. In this study we investigated the chemopreventive properties of PIN on cell lines derived from different sites either expressing or not the functional tumor suppressor protein p53. It was found that PIN inhibited the proliferation of p53 wild type colon and prostate tumor cells (HCT116 and LNCaP) while in breast cells the inhibition of growth was observed only in p53 mutant cells (MDA-MB-231). A potent antiproliferative activity of PIN was also observed on p53 null cells HL60 (IC50% 8 muM), their multidrug resistant variant HL60R (IC50% 32 muM) and K562. On HL60 cells, PIN caused a block of cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, induced a weak proapoptotic effect but it was a good trigger of differentiation (NBT reduction and CD11b expression). PIN caused an upregulation of the CDK inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1) both at mRNA and protein levels so suggesting that this could be a mechanism by which PIN reduced proliferation and induced differentiation on HL60 cells.",,"['Sepporta, Maria Vittoria', 'Mazza, Teresa', 'Morozzi, Guido', 'Fabiani, Roberto']","['Sepporta MV', 'Mazza T', 'Morozzi G', 'Fabiani R']","['a Dipartimento di Specialita Medico-Chirurgiche e Sanita Pubblica, Sezione di Epidemiologia Molecolare ed Igiene Ambientale , Universita degli Studi di Perugia , Perugia , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131007,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'V4N1UDY811 (pinoresinol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/10/09 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,['2013/10/09 06:00'],"['2013/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2013.828089 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2013;65(8):1208-18. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2013.828089.

Their molecular detection has recently gained wide recognition in the diagnosis and prognosis of these neoplasms. For that purpose various molecular approaches have been used but a universally accepted method is still lacking. In this study we aimed to develop a novel bead-based liquid assay using Locked nucleic acids (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide probes for multiplexed detection of the most frequent IDH1 (p.R132C, p.R132G, p.R132H, p.R132L, p.R132S) and IDH2 (p.R140Q, p.R172K) mutations. The method includes four steps: 1) PCR amplification of the targeted fragments with biotinylated primers; 2) Direct hybridization to barcoded microbeads with specific LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes; 3) Incubation with phycoerythrin coupled streptavidin; 4) Acquisition of fluorescent intensities of each set of beads on a flow platform (LuminexCorp., USA). We tested the performance of the assay on both artificial plasmid constructs and on clinical samples from 114 patients with known or suspected myeloid malignancies. The method appeared to be superior to direct sequencing having a much higher sensitivity of 2.5% mutant alleles. Applying this method to patients' samples we identified a total of 9 mutations (one IDH1 p.R132C, seven IDH2 p.R140Q and one IDH2 p.R172K). In conclusion, this method could be successfully implemented in the diagnostic work-up for various tumors known to harbor IDH1/2 mutations (e.g. myeloid malignancies, gliomas, etc.).

Although mechanisms underlying the progression are largely unknown, recent studies revealed the presence of alterations of key molecules for hematopoiesis, such as AML1/RUNX1. Our analysis of 13 BC cases revealed that three cases had AML1 mutations and the transcript levels of wild-type (wt.) AML1 were elevated in BC compared with CP. Functional analysis of representative AML1 mutants using mouse hematopoietic cells revealed the possible contribution of some, but not all, mutants for the BC-phenotype. Specifically, K83Q and R139G, but neither R80C nor D171N mutants, conferred upon BCR-ABL-expressing cells a growth advantage over BCR-ABL-alone control cells in cytokine-free culture, and the cells thus grown killed mice upon intravenous transfer. Unexpectedly, wt.AML1 behaved similarly to K83Q and R139G mutants. In a bone marrow transplantation assay, K83Q and wt.AML1s induced the emergence of blast-like cells. The overall findings suggest the roles of altered functions of AML1 imposed by some, but not all, mutants, and the elevated expression of wt.AML1 for the disease progression of CML.",,"['Yamamoto, Kiyoko', 'Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Seto, Masao', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yamamoto K', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Minami Y', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Abe A', 'Ohshima K', 'Seto M', 'Naoe T']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan ; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0074864 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-18130 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Sep 30;8(9):e74864. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0074864. eCollection 2013.,PMC3787010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, they may lead to insufficient tumor distribution of therapeutic agents, and often cause adverse effects on patients. In this contribution, we propose a novel therapeutic approach in which relatively high doses of Hydroxychloroquine and Chlorambucil were loaded into biodegradable nanoparticles coated with an anti-CD20 antibody. We demonstrate their ability to effectively target and internalize in tumor B-cells. Moreover, these nanoparticles were able to kill not only p53 mutated/deleted lymphoma cell lines expressing a low amount of CD20, but also circulating primary cells purified from chronic lymphocitic leukemia patients. Their safety was demonstrated in healthy mice, and their therapeutic effects in a new model of Burkitt's lymphoma. The latter serves as a prototype of an aggressive lympho-proliferative disease. In vitro and in vivo data showed the ability of anti-CD20 nanoparticles loaded with Hydroxychloroquine and Chlorambucil to increase tumor cell killing in comparison to free cytotoxic agents or Rituximab. These results shed light on the potential of anti-CD20 nanoparticles carrying Hydroxychloroquine and Chlorambucil for controlling a disseminated model of aggressive lymphoma, and lend credence to the idea of adopting this therapeutic approach for the treatment of B-cell disorders.",,"['Mezzaroba, Nelly', 'Zorzet, Sonia', 'Secco, Erika', 'Biffi, Stefania', 'Tripodo, Claudio', 'Calvaruso, Marco', 'Mendoza-Maldonado, Ramiro', 'Capolla, Sara', 'Granzotto, Marilena', 'Spretz, Ruben', 'Larsen, Gustavo', 'Noriega, Sandra', 'Lucafo, Marianna', 'Mansilla, Eduardo', 'Garrovo, Chiara', 'Marin, Gustavo H', 'Baj, Gabriele', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Nunez, Luis', 'Macor, Paolo']","['Mezzaroba N', 'Zorzet S', 'Secco E', 'Biffi S', 'Tripodo C', 'Calvaruso M', 'Mendoza-Maldonado R', 'Capolla S', 'Granzotto M', 'Spretz R', 'Larsen G', 'Noriega S', 'Lucafo M', 'Mansilla E', 'Garrovo C', 'Marin GH', 'Baj G', 'Gattei V', 'Pozzato G', 'Nunez L', 'Macor P']","['Dept. of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydroxychloroquine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanoparticles/*therapeutic use', 'Rituximab']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0074216 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-18875 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Sep 30;8(9):e74216. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0074216. eCollection 2013.,PMC3787049,,"['R44 CA135906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2R44CA135906-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the consequences of an aberrant testicular environment in cryptorchidism we used a mouse model with a deletion of Rxfp2 gene resulting in a high intra-abdominal testicular position. Mutant males were infertile with the gross morphology of the cryptorchid testis progressively deteriorating with age. Few spermatogonia were identifiable in 12 month old cryptorchid testes. Gene expression analysis showed no difference between mutant and control testes at postnatal day 10. In three month old males a decrease in expression of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) markers Id4, Nanos2, and Ret was shown. The direct counting of ID4+ cells supported a significant decrease of SSCs. In contrast, the expression of Plzf, a marker for undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia was not reduced, and the number of PLZF+ cells in the cryptorchid testis was higher in three month old testes, but equal to control in six month old mutants. The PLZF+ cells did not show a higher rate of apoptosis in cryptorchid testis. The expression of the Sertoli cell FGF2 gene required for SSC maintenance was significantly reduced in mutant testis. Based on these findings we propose that the deregulation of somatic and germ cell genes in the cryptorchid testis, directs the SSCs towards the differentiation pathway. This leads to a depletion of the SSC pool and an increase in the number of PLZF+ spermatogonial cells, which too, eventually decreases with the exhaustion of the stem cell pool. Such a dynamic suggests that an early correction of cryptorchidism is critical for the retention of the SSC pool.",,"['Ferguson, Lydia', 'How, Javier J', 'Agoulnik, Alexander I']","['Ferguson L', 'How JJ', 'Agoulnik AI']","['Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, Florida, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Idb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nanos2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RXFP2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cryptorchidism/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/deficiency/*genetics', 'Sertoli Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Spermatogonia/growth & development/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Testis/growth & development/metabolism/*pathology']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0077351 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-25624 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Oct 3;8(10):e77351. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0077351. eCollection 2013.,PMC3789668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its cytoplasmic function especially in CML remains to be seen. We studied the localization of p27(kip1) and its function during the progression of CML from chronic to blast phase. Our investigations revealed an increased localization of p27(kip1) in the cytoplasm of CD34(+) cells in the blast phase compared to chronic phase. Cytoplasmic p27(kip1) was found to modulate RhoA activity in CD34(+) stem and progenitor cells. Further, RhoA activity was shown to be dependent on cytoplasmic p27(kip1) which in turn was dependent on p210(Bcr-Abl) kinase activity. Interestingly, RhoA activity was observed to affect cell survival in the presence of imatinib through the SAPK/JNK pathway. Accordingly, inhibition of SAPK/JNK pathway using SP600125 increased apoptosis of K562 cells in presence of imatinib. Our results, for the first time, thus reveal a crucial link between cytoplasmic p27(kip1), RhoA activity and SAPK/JNK signalling.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins consists of about 25 members and has been extensively studied in the context of apoptosis.

The aim of this study was to dissect a potential role of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells independent of their cell death control function. We used migration and invasion assays as well as three dimensional cell cultures to analyze colorectal cancer cell lines (HT29 and SW480) after siRNA mediated knockdown or overexpression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. We observed neither spontaneous cell death induction nor impaired proliferation of cells lacking Mcl-1, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. In contrast, knockdown of Mcl-1 led to increased proliferation. Strikingly, we demonstrate a profound impairment of both, migration and invasion, of colorectal cancer cells after Mcl-1, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL knockdown. This phenotype was completely revised in cells overexpressing Mcl-1, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. The most pronounced effect among the investigated proteins was observed for Bcl-2.

The relative importance of these two cycles in viral replication varies during infection. The majority of infected clones are created early before the onset of an efficient immune response. Later on, the main replication route is mitotic expansion of pre-existing infected clones. Due to the paucity of available samples and for ethical reasons, only scarce data is available on early infection by HTLV-1. Therefore, we addressed this question in a comparative BLV model. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify the insertion sites of the provirus in order to monitor the clonality of the BLV-infected cells population (i.e. the number of distinct clones and abundance of each clone). We found that BLV propagation shifts from cell neoinfection to clonal proliferation in about 2 months from inoculation. Initially, BLV proviral integration significantly favors transcribed regions of the genome. Negative selection then eliminates 97% of the clones detected at seroconversion and disfavors BLV-infected cells carrying a provirus located close to a promoter or a gene. Nevertheless, among the surviving proviruses, clone abundance positively correlates with proximity of the provirus to a transcribed region. Two opposite forces thus operate during primary infection and dictate the fate of long term clonal composition: (1) initial integration inside genes or promoters and (2) host negative selection disfavoring proviruses located next to transcribed regions. The result of this initial response will contribute to the proviral load set point value as clonal abundance will benefit from carrying a provirus in transcribed regions.",,"['Gillet, Nicolas A', 'Gutierrez, Geronimo', 'Rodriguez, Sabrina M', 'de Brogniez, Alix', 'Renotte, Nathalie', 'Alvarez, Irene', 'Trono, Karina', 'Willems, Luc']","['Gillet NA', 'Gutierrez G', 'Rodriguez SM', 'de Brogniez A', 'Renotte N', 'Alvarez I', 'Trono K', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA) of University of Liege (ULg), Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium ; Molecular and Cellular Biology, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege (ULg), Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131003,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genome', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proviruses/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Virus Integration']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/05/27 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1003687 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-13-01496 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(10):e1003687. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003687.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with HCL with >/=2 prior therapies requiring treatment received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) days 1 and 15 plus bendamustine 70 (n = 6) or 90 (n = 6) mg/m(2), days 1 and 2, for six cycles at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: At 70 and 90 mg/m(2)/dose of bendamustine, overall response rate was 100%, with three (50%) and four (67%) complete remissions (CR) in each respective group. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was absent in 67% and 100% of CRs, respectively. All six without MRD remain in CR at 30 to 35 (median, 31) months of follow-up. Soluble CD22 and CD25 levels decreased with all responses, with median values decreasing from 17.7 and 42 ng/mL at baseline to undetectable and 2 ng/mL after CR, respectively (P < 0.001). Of 12 patients receiving 72 cycles of BR, the most common toxicities were hematologic, including thrombocytopenia (83%), lymphopenia (75%), leukopenia (58%), and neutropenia (42%). Grade III and IV hematologic toxicity included lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia (each 75%), leukopenia (58%), and neutropenia (25%). No significant dose-related differences were detected in response or toxicity. CONCLUSION: BR has significant activity in HCL. Bendamustine at either 70 or 90 mg/m(2)/dose was highly effective in multiply relapsed/refractory HCL and could be considered for achieving durable CRs without MRD in patients after failure of standard therapies. As it was not dose-limiting, 90 mg/m(2)/dose was chosen for future testing.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Burotto, Mauricio', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Arons, Evgeny', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'Kreitman, Robert J']","['Burotto M', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Arons E', 'Zhou H', 'Wilson W', 'Kreitman RJ']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Laboratories of Molecular Biology and Pathology, and Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20131004,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1848 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1848 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Nov 15;19(22):6313-21. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1848.

We report the outcome of 45 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent myeloablative single unit cord blood transplantation from unrelated donors within the GETH/GITMO cooperative group. Conditioning regimens were based on combinations of thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophospamide or fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. At the time of transplantation, 35 patients (78%) were in first complete remission, four (8%) in second complete remission and six (14%) in third or subsequent response. The cumulative incidence of myeloid engraftment was 96% at a median time of 20 days and significantly better for patients receiving higher doses of CD34(+) cells. The incidence of acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease was 31%, while that of overall chronic graft-versus-host disease was 53%. Treatment-related mortality was 17% at day +100 and 31% at 5 years. The 5-year relapse, event-free survival and overall survival rates were 31%, 36% and 44%, respectively. Although the event-free and overall survival rates in patients without BCR/ABL transcripts detectable at time of transplant were better than those in whom BCR/ABL transcripts were detected (46% versus 24% and 60% versus 30%, respectively) these differences were not statistically significant in the univariate analysis (P=0.07).

Among 138 patients with cytogenetic information, normal karyotype was the most common (47.1%) followed by complex karyotype (14.5%) and sole +8 (9.4%). Among these patients, the relapse-free survival rate at 1 year was 37% and 13% at 3 years, and the respective overall survival rates were 24% and 8%. Whereas the 90 patients who survived beyond 30 days had the same relapse-free survival rates, their 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates were 36% and 11%, respectively. Of the 66 patients surviving beyond 30 days who could be classified into European LeukemiaNet genetic groups, those in the intermediate-I group had better overall survival than patients in the adverse group (P=0.01). Among patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia who were tested for the European LeukemiaNet-associated molecular alterations, FLT3-internal tandem duplication and NPM1 mutations, it was found that FLT3-internal tandem duplication (detected in 29% of patients) did not associate with overall survival (P=0.31), whereas NPM1 mutations (30%) were associated with a significantly longer overall survival (P=0.002).

Allo-reactive CD4(+) T cells can mediate direct cytolysis, but may also stimulate production of IgG antibodies as helper cells. Immune complexes may subsequently be processed and presented by professional antigen presenting cells and stimulate induction of specific CD8(+) T cells. As such, proteins targeted in coordinated T- and B-cell responses may represent a class of immunodominant antigens in clinical responses after alloSCT. We previously identified LB-PTK2B-1T as HLA class II restricted polymorphic antigen in a patient treated with donor lymphocyte infusion for relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia after HLA-matched alloSCT. Since PTK2B has also been described as antibody target, we here investigated whether a coordinated T- and B-cell response against PTK2B was induced. Patient serum before and after alloSCT and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was screened for antibodies, and we indeed observed development of a humoral immune response against PTK2B. Antibodies against PTK2B were only found after DLI and, in contrast to the CD4(+) T cells, recognized a monomorphic region of the protein.

Its primary function, to deposit the histone mark H3K27me3, promotes transcriptional repression. The activity of EZH2 influences cell fate regulation, namely the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The contribution of aberrant EZH2 expression to tumorigenesis by directing cells toward a cancer stem cell (CSC) state is increasingly recognized. However, its role in hematological malignancies is complex. Point mutations, resulting in gain-of-function, and inactivating mutations, reported in lymphoma and leukemia, respectively, suggest that EZH2 may serve a dual purpose as an oncogene and tumor-suppressor gene. The reduction of CSC self-renewal via EZH2 inhibition offers a potentially attractive therapeutic approach to counter the aberrant activation found in lymphoma and leukemia. The discovery of small molecules that specifically inhibit EZH2 raises the exciting possibility of exploiting the oncogenic addiction of tumor cells toward this protein. However, interference with the tumor-suppressor role of wild-type EZH2 must be avoided.

Through intracellular staining for transcription factors, we have defined three subsets of iNKT cells (NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17) that produced distinct cytokines; these represented diverse lineages and not developmental stages, as previously thought. These subsets exhibited substantial interstrain variation in numbers. In several mouse strains, including BALB/c, NKT2 cells were abundant and were stimulated by self ligands to produce IL-4. In those strains, steady-state IL-4 conditioned CD8(+) T cells to become 'memory-like', increased serum concentrations of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and caused dendritic cells to produce chemokines.

RECENT FINDINGS: Blast cells in ALL express a variety of specific antigens, such as CD19, CD20, CD22, CD33 and CD52, and recently monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) became available to target these antigens. The anti-CD20 MoAb rituximab has substantially improved the outcome in Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and is currently applied in de-novo B-precursor ALL. The MoAbs directed against CD22, linked to cytotoxic agents, either to calicheamicin (inotuzomab ozogamicin) or to plant or bacterial toxins (epratuzumab) are explored in refractory/relapsed childhood and adult ALL. Targeting CD19 is of great interest, as it is expressed in all B-lineage cells, including early precursors. The new bispecific antibody blinatumomab combines single chain antibodies to CD19 and CD3, and thereby T cells lyse the CD19 bearing B cells and is effective in patients with positive minimal residual disease (MRD) or refractory/relapsed ALL. SUMMARY: Antibody therapy in ALL is very promising, with high rate of complete remission and MRD-negativity in advanced ALL. It is currently explored in de-novo ALL to establish the best setting in combination with chemotherapy or even as a monotherapy.",,"['Hoelzer, Dieter']",['Hoelzer D'],"['Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods/trends', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000009 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2013 Nov;25(6):701-6. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age was 48 years (22 to 68); 14 out of 26 leukemia patients (54 %) had circulating blasts at transplant, 20 (50 %) evaluable patients had poor-risk cytogenetics, 12 (25 %) had prior SCT, and 10 (21 %) received stem cells from a mismatch donor. All patients received tacrolimus with or without methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. At the time of analysis, 13 patients (27 %) were alive and disease free. Engraftment was complete in all patients. The median time to ANC recovery (>500) was 12 days (range, 6-28). The most common grade III and IV toxicities were mucositis and infections. Eighteen patients (43 %) developed grade II-IV acute GVHD, and eight (26 %) had extensive chronic GVHD. Of 44 evaluable patients for response, 28 (64 %) achieved a complete remission (CR), and seven (15 %) had a partial remission after the transplant. With a median follow-up of 30 months (4 to 124 months) for surviving patients, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 45 % at 1 year, and the probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 22.5 %. Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (<80,000/mL) and lactic dehydrogenase (>500 IU/L) at SCT were associated with relapse. Age less than 53 years and CR after SCT were associated with better OS.

The objective of this study is to identify the presence of acquired hemoglobinopathy in children diagnosed with hematological malignancies and compare these against healthy controls. Prospective matched case-control study held from 2010 to 2012. For each patient with hematological malignancy two healthy controls matched on gender, age and race were recruited. Patients with other co-morbidities were excluded. All samples underwent supravital staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) electrophoresis. Following identification of abnormal results, molecular genetic testing for all alpha- and beta-thalassemia mutations prevalent in the Greek population was performed. Other causes of anemia were ruled out based on specific testing. A total of 44 (32 males) patients with a mean age of 7.1 years were enrolled in the study. Hematological disorders included acute lymphocytic leukemia (24), acute myeloid leukemia (8), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (8), Hodgkin disease (3), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (1). Following exclusion of congenital hemoglobinopathies, atypical HPLC electrophoretic findings persisted in 18.1 % of the patient group, compared to 0 % in the control group (p < 0.001). The patient group showed marked microcytic anemia (p < 0.01) and detection of small inclusions (p = 0.034) on supravital staining. Comparison of the HPLC findings between the groups demonstrated significantly lower percentages of HbA (p = 0.02), normal HbA2 and higher percentage of fast moving Hb bands (p = 0.04) in the patient group. Interestingly, the majority of these patients belonged to the high-risk group. Acquired hemoglobinopathy is recognized in adult patients.

Donor-derived NK cells have been shown to contribute to the eradication of malignant cells after allo-HSCT, when recipients lack ligands for their inhibitory receptors. These alloreactive donor NK cells can also kill recipient APCs and CTLs, thus preventing the occurrence of GvHD and graft rejection. The role of activating receptors on the capacity of NK cells to kill leukemia targets has become evident in the last years. The adoptive infusion of ex vivo-activated NK cells has been investigated recently in Phase I/II trials on patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors, with promising results. gammadelta T lymphocytes are also able to display anti-tumor activity-this providing the biological rationale for Phase I/II trials in lymphoproliferative disorders and solid tumors.

Many of these insights were gained in mouse ESCs that are derived and maintained using serum, either on feeder cells or supplemented with the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These 'serum' ESCs are in a metastable state characterized by the expression of many lineage-specifying genes. The use of two small-molecule kinase inhibitors (2i), targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), has enabled derivation of mouse ESCs in defined serum-free conditions. These '2i' ESCs are more homogeneous in morphology and gene expression than serum ESCs, and are postulated to represent the ground state of pluripotency. Recent studies have shown that the epigenome and transcriptome of 2i and serum ESCs are markedly different, suggesting that these ESCs represent two distinct states of pluripotency regulated by different factors and pathways. There is growing evidence that the 2i ESCs closely parallel the early blastocyst cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) or even earlier stages, while serum cells possibly reflect later stages. In this review, we will focus on the difference in chromatin structure, transcription regulation and cell cycle regulation between ground state pluripotent 2i ESCs and serum ESCs, and compare to corresponding data in embryos if available.

A previously established bone-tissue mimetic system consisting of silk protein biomaterials in combination with hydroxyapatite and human cells was used for the study. Silk-hydroxyapatite films were pre-complexed with the non-nitrogenous bisphosphonate clodronate or the nitrogenous bisphosphonate alendronate and cultured with THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cell line-derived osteoclasts, human mesenchymal stem cell derived osteoblasts or a direct co-culture of the two cell types. Metabolic activity, calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity were assessed over 12 weeks, and reconstructed remodeled biomaterial surfaces were also evaluated for quantitative morphological changes. Increased metabolic activity and increased roughness were found on the clodronate-complexed biomaterial substrates remodeled by osteoblasts and co-cultures of osteoblasts with osteoclasts, even at doses high enough to cause a 90% decrease in osteoclast metabolic activity. Films complexed with low doses of alendronate resulted in increased metabolic activity and calcium deposition by osteoblasts, while higher doses were similarly toxic among osteoclasts, osteoblasts and co-cultures. These results point to the utility of these well-defined bone-mimetic in vitro cultures as useful screens for therapeutics for bone-related diseases, particularly with the ability to conduct studies for extended duration (here for 12 weeks) and with pre-complexed drugs to mimic conditions found in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Mcl-1 had no effect on osteoclast differentiation, but its overexpression prolonged osteoclast survival and suppressed the bone-resorbing activity of these cells, as determined by pit formation assay. Conversely, Mcl-1 depletion suppressed osteoclast survival and increased bone resorption. This negative role for Mcl-1 on the bone-resorptive activities of osteoclasts may be caused by the increase in adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratio. Finally, we showed that the local deletion of Mcl-1 by the injection of the Cre adenovirus into the calvaria of Mcl1(fl/fl) mice significantly affected GST-RANKL-induced bone resorption in vivo.

Deregulation of BCL2 family proteins contributes to programmed cell death evasion, that is a hallmark of human cancers and it is often related to (chemo)therapy resistance. High BCL2 levels have been detected in most human lymphoid malignancies, not limited to follicular lymphoma (where the role of BCL2 overexpression is driven by the t[14;18] translocation) but also B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma. For all these reasons, the opportunity to induce apoptosis by targeting BCL2 proteins is considered a potentially promising therapeutic approach in hematological malignancies. BCL2 family inhibition strategies currently explored in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials are essentially two: (1) the use of antisense-based strategies to knockdown BCL2 or BCLXL expression (e.g. oblimersen) or (2) the use of synthetic BH3 mimetics i.e. small molecules binding to anti-apoptotic inhibitors thereby allowing the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only molecules (e.g. obatoclax, AT-101, ABT-737 and its derivatives ABT-263 and ABT-199). Several of these drugs demonstrated relevant clinical activity as single-agent or in combination therapy, with the most significant drawbacks in clinical use being represented by challenging pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. iv administration, high-levels of plasma proteins binding) and on-target side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal toxicity and thrombocytopenia). Further clinical development of the current compounds (e.g. ABT-199), showing high efficacy but devoid of the most threatening drug-related toxicities, is eagerly awaited. Hopefully, in the next future, BCL2 inhibitors (alone or in combination with immuno- and/or chemo-therapeutic agents) will represent target-specific drugs expanding our therapeutic armamentarium in the fight against hematologic malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One group was treated with VGDE orally (500 mg/kg) and the other with a vehicle control for 30 days. Body weight and tumor volumes were measured 2x a week and on the 33rd day, the mice were euthanized and tumors harvested and weighed. For the cytotoxicity study, the WST-1 assay was used to determine the activity of pentaisovaleryl sucrose previously isolated from VGDE. The cancer cell lines used in the cytotoxicity study included breast, colon, leukemia, lung, melanoma, ovarian and prostate. RESULTS: Prostate cancer (PC-3) xenograft tumors treated with VGDE showed a significant decrease in tumor size (P=0.0295) compared to control. Pentaisovaleryl sucrose also demonstrated cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines with IC(5)(0) values as follows: MDA-MD-231-6.66microM; MCF-7-7.50 microM; HCT116-14.12 microM; A549-5.76 microM; HL60-6.43 microM; A375-8.64 microM; OVCAR3-9.53 microM; Capan1-7.13 microM; Mia-Paca 6.47 microM. CONCLUSION: VGDE does possess in vivo activity against prostate tumor and has potential for development into a natural product for the treatment of prostate cancer. This study thus provides preliminary validation for the folk use of Vernonia guineensis against prostate conditions. Further in vivo studies are however required to confirm these results and to understand the mechanism of action of VGDE and the in vivo efficacy of pentaisovaleryl sucrose.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recent scientific research revealed multiple effects of Korean red ginseng, including anticancer activity. To evaluate the effect of Korean red ginseng extract (KRGE) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and elucidate its molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NB4 cells were treated with 1mg/ml KRGE for 48 h and examined for cell proliferation and differentiation. Cell cycle distribution of KRGE-treated cells was analyzed and the expression level of G1 phase regulators was determined. MYC was overexpressed by retroviral transduction and its effect on SKP2 and CDKN1B gene expression, cell proliferation, cell cycle and differentiation was evaluated in KRGE-treated cells. RESULTS: KRGE alone was sufficient to induce granulocytic differentiation accompanied with growth inhibition. KRGE treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase with augmented Cdkn1b proteins without changes in transcript levels. Cycloheximide treatment revealed reduced degradation of Cdkn1b protein by KRGE. In addition, KRGE treatment reduced expression of MYC and SKP2 genes, both at mRNA and protein levels. Upon ectopic expression of MYC, the effect of KRGE was reversed with lesser reduction and induction of SKP2 gene and Cdkn1b protein, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest a sequential molecular mechanism from MYC reduction, SKP2 reduction, Cdkn1b protein stabilization, G1 phase arrest to granulocytic differentiation by KRGE in human APL. CONCLUSIONS: KRGE induces leukemic proliferation to differentiation transition in APL through modulation of the MYC-SKP2-CDKN1B axis.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Multiple mouse models of CML express BCR/ABL at high levels from non-Bcr promoters, resulting in the development of leukemias. In contrast, a significant fraction of healthy humans have been found to have BCR/ABL-positive hematopoietic cells. To bridge the gap between the information derived from current mouse models and nonleukemic humans with the BCR/ABL oncogene, we generated a knockin model with BCR/ABL p210 expressed from the Bcr locus. Unlike previous models, expression of BCR/ABL from the knockin allele did not induce leukemia. BCR/ABL mutant cells did exhibit favorable bone marrow engraftment compared to control cells. These data suggest that BCR/ABL expression alone is insufficient to induce disease.

Here, we show that knockdown of HIF-2alpha, and to a much lesser extent HIF-1alpha, impedes the long-term repopulating ability of human CD34(+) umbilical cord blood cells. HIF-2alpha-deficient HSPCs display increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which subsequently stimulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and triggers apoptosis by activation of the unfolded-protein-response (UPR) pathway.

MPs were isolated from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant sub-clones of a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. MPs were assessed for size, mitochondria, RNA and phospholipid content, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and orientation and ATPase activity relative to drug sequestration capacity. Of the drug classes examined, MPs sequestered the anthracycline class to a significant degree. The degree of sequestration was likely due to the size of MPs and thus the amount of cargo they contain, to which the anthracyclines bind. Moreover, a proportion of the P-gp present on MPs was inside-out in orientation, enabling it to influx drugs rather than its typical efflux function. This was confirmed by surface immunofluorescence and by assessment of drug-stimulated ATPase activity following MP permeabilization. Thus we determined that breast cancer MPs carried a proportion of their P-gp oriented inside-out, providing active sequestration within the microvesicular compartment. These results demonstrate a capacity for MPs to sequester chemotherapeutic drugs, which has a predominantly active sequestration component for MPs derived from drug-resistant cells and a predominantly passive component for MPs derived from drug-sensitive cells. This reduction in available drug concentration has potential to contribute to a parallel pathway and complements that of the intercellular transfer of P-gp. These findings lend further support to the role of MPs in limiting the successful management of cancer.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Three BCR-ABL inhibitors, imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). METHODS: This article reviews the key phase III clinical trials supporting the use of first-line imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib in patients with CML-CP, as well as findings of supportive phase II studies. RESULTS: At the time of its approval in 2001, imatinib induced unprecedented response rates in patients with CML-CP; however, resistance and intolerance to imatinib prevent 20% to 30% of patients from deriving full therapeutic benefit. Nilotinib and dasatinib, both approved in 2010 for first-line CML-CP treatment, are more potent than imatinib and less susceptible to imatinib resistance mechanisms. Comparative clinical trials of each agent with imatinib have shown that they are associated with significantly deeper and more rapid responses than standard-dose imatinib, without compromising safety. CONCLUSIONS: Given that evidence suggests achievement of an early response is predictive of improved long-term outcomes, earlier use of these compounds may lead to more rapid, deeper responses corresponding with improvements in patient outcome.

Structural characterization encompasses elemental analysis (CHNS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), Fournier transform infrared (FIT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to verify the process of association between the drug 5-FU and Cu-BTC MOF. Flow cytometry was done to indicate that apoptosis is the mechanism responsible for the cell death. The release profile of the drug 5-FU from Cu-BTC MOF for 48 hours was obeisant. Also, the anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by the peritonitis testing and the production of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured. The chemical characterization of the material indicated the presence of drug associated with the coordination network in a proportion of 0.82 g 5-FU per 1.0 g of Cu-BTC MOF. The cytotoxic tests were carried out against four cell lines: NCI-H292, MCF-7, HT29 and HL60. The Cu-BTC MOF associated drug was extremely cytotoxic against the human breast cancer adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell line and against human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60), cancer cells were killed by apoptosis mechanisms. The drug demonstrated a slow release profile where 82% of the drug was released in 48 hours.

When using NK cells from peripheral blood, the number of expanded NK cells can be highly variable and the need for NK cell enrichment can make the process expensive. The NK-92 cell line (CD56+/CD3-) that was isolated from a patient with lymphoma has predictable high cytotoxic activity and can be expanded under good manufacturing practice conditions in recombinant interleukin-2. METHODS: Fifteen patients (age, 9-71 years) with advanced, treatment-resistant malignancies, either solid tumors/sarcomas (n = 13) or leukemia/lymphoma (n = 2), received two infusions of NK-92 cells, given 48 h apart. Three cohorts of patients were treated with escalating doses of NK-92 cells (n = 7 at 1 x 10(9), n = 6 at 3 x 10(9) and n = 2 at 1 x 10(10) cells/m(2)). RESULTS: No infusion-related or long-term side effects were observed. The dose of 10(10) cells/m(2) was considered the maximum expandable cell dose with the use of an established culture bag system. Three fourths of patients with lung cancer had some anti-tumor response. Only one patient of seven had development of human leukocyte antigen antibodies. The persistence of NK-92 cells (male origin) in the circulation was confirmed by Y chromosome-specific polymerase chain reaction in two female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Infusions of NK-92 cells up to 10(10) cells/m(2) were well tolerated. Despite the allogeneic nature of NK-92, development of human leukocyte antigen antibodies in these patients with cancer appears to be rare. The cells can persist in the recipient's circulation for at least 48 h. Some encouraging responses were seen in patients with advanced lung cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2013 International Society for Cellular Therapy. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Between January 2007 and June 2008, a total of 316 newly diagnosed, consecutive patients (aged 15 years or above) of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with anaemia (haemoglobin <11 g/dl), were analysed to determine the prevalence and a subgroup of 46 patients was analysed for the cause of anaemia. RESULTS: Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were the diagnoses in 81 (25.8%), 203 (64.7%) and 30 (9.6%) patients, respectively. Anaemia was present in 134 patients (42.4%). Anaemia of chronic disease was present in 33/46 (71.7%) and iron deficiency in 18/46 (39.1%) patients. Vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency was detected in 10/46 (21.7%) patients (B12 deficiency alone in 7, folate deficiency alone in 1 and combined B12 and folate deficiency in 2). Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia was detected in 5/46 (10.9%) although direct Coombs test was positive in 17/46 (37%) patients. Among patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, anaemia due to bone marrow involvement was present in 16/40 (40%). In most patients with bone marrow involvement, anaemia was due to other causes. In only 3 patients, anaemia was attributable to bone marrow involvement alone. Anaemia was multifactorial in 18/46 (39.1%) patients. Nutritional deficiency alone or in combination was present in 22/46 (47.8%) patients. CONCLUSION: Anaemia is common in lymphoid malignancies at initial presentation. Besides managing anaemia of chronic disease and bone marrow involvement, nutritional and autoimmune causes should be ruled out.","['Copyright 2013, NMJI.']","['Ghosh, J', 'Singh, R K Bikramjit', 'Saxena, R', 'Gupta, R', 'Vivekanandan, S', 'Sreenivas, V', 'Raina, V', 'Sharma, A', 'Kumar, L']","['Ghosh J', 'Singh RK', 'Saxena R', 'Gupta R', 'Vivekanandan S', 'Sreenivas V', 'Raina V', 'Sharma A', 'Kumar L']","['Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai 400012, Maharashtra, India - Department of Medical Oncology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/epidemiology/etiology', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/epidemiology/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/complications', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/complications', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2013 Mar-Apr;26(2):79-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major role is played by alloreactive donor T-cell clones leading to host tissue damage. Selective depletion is a strategy to eliminate host-reactive donor T cells from haematopoietic stem cell allografts to prevent graft-versus-host disease while conserving useful donor immune functions. We have used irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cancer patients and healthy donor cells as responder cells in primary mixed leukocyte reaction. To prepare graft-versus leukaemia/myeloma-specific T cells, alloreactive T cells in primary mixed leukocyte reaction were depleted with anti-CD25 immunotoxin. The remaining T cells had insignificant alloreactivity in secondary mixed leukocyte reaction. Then, allodepleted donor T cells were repeatedly stimulated using purified leukaemia/tumour cells from the same cancer patient. Leukaemia/tumour-reactive donor T cells were purified using cell sorter on the basis of CD4 and CD8 activation. Their specificity was tested in nonradioactive cytotoxicity test. We performed 22 reactions (15 samples with leukemic and 7 samples with multiple myeloma cells). Selective depletion of alloreactive donor T cells with anti-CD25 immunotoxin led to significant depletion (99.2-100 %, median 99.7%). The effect of donor T cells was well preserved, while the graft-versus-host reactivation of donor cells was negligible, even after repeated stimulation with patient's non-tumour cells. Thus, it is possible to selectively deplete donor alloreactive T cells with anti-CD25 immunotoxin. In the cases of leukaemia patients, a strong graft-versus-leukaemia reactivity was noticed in allodepleted donor T cells; in myeloma patients, graft-versus-myeloma reactivity was less significant.",,"['Matejkova, E', 'Foltankova, V', 'Buresova, I']","['Matejkova E', 'Foltankova V', 'Buresova I']","['National Tissue Centre, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/06/12 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['FB2013A0021 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2013;59(4):146-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study we showed that the germline p.I171V mutation in NBN may be considered as a risk factor in the development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and some specific haplotypes of that gene may be associated with childhood leukemia. These findings raise important questions about the role of mutations in others genes of the MRN complex in childhood leukemia. The aim of this study was to answer the question whether MRE11 and RAD50 alterations may be associated with childhood ALL or AML. METHODS: We estimated the frequency of constitutional mutations and polymorphisms in selected regions of MRE11, RAD50, and NBN in the group of 220 children diagnosed with childhood leukemias and controls (n=504/2200). The analysis was performed by specific amplification of region of interest by PCR and followed by multi-temperature single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-MSSCP) technique. We performed two molecular tests to examine any potential function of the detected the c.551+19G>A SNP in RAD50 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the MRE11, RAD50 and NBN genes in childhood leukemia. RESULTS: The frequency of either the AA genotype or A allele of RAD50_rs17166050 were significantly different in controls compared to leukemia group (ALL+AML) (p<0.0019 and p<0.0019, respectively). The cDNA analysis of AA or GA genotypes carriers has not revealed evidence of splicing abnormality of RAD50 pre-mRNA. We measured the allelic-specific expression of G and A alleles at c.551+19G>A and the statistically significant overexpression of the G allele has been observed. Additionally we confirmed the higher incidence of the p.I171V mutation in the leukemia group (7/220) than among controls (12/2400) (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The formerly reported sequence variants in the RAD50 and MRE11 gene may not constitute a risk factor of childhood ALL in Polish population. The RAD50_rs17166050 variant allele is linked to decreased ALL risk (p<0.0009, OR=0.6358 (95%CI: 0.4854-0.8327)). Despite the fact that there is no splicing abnormality in carriers of the variant allele but an excess of the G over the A allele was consistently observed. This data demonstrate that some specific alternations of the RAD50 gene may be associated with childhood ALL.",,"['Mosor, Maria', 'Ziolkowska-Suchanek, Iwona', 'Nowicka, Karina', 'Dzikiewicz-Krawczyk, Agnieszka', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta', 'Nowak, Jerzy']","['Mosor M', 'Ziolkowska-Suchanek I', 'Nowicka K', 'Dzikiewicz-Krawczyk A', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D', 'Nowak J']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479, Poznan, Poland. m_mosor@man.poznan.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131005,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genotype', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,,2013/10/08 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/10/08 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-457 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-457 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Oct 5;13:457. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-457.,PMC3851537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, detailed characterization and investigation of outcomes and risk factors on survival have not been addressed. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 42,584 cancer patients covering the period between 1996 and 2008 using the institutional cancer registry system. Among 816 HM patients, 61 patients with IP were recognized. The clinical features, laboratory results, and histological types were studied to determine the impact of IP on survival and identify the profile of prognostic factors. RESULTS: HM patients with IP showed a significant worse survival than those without IP in the 5-year overall survival (P = 0.027). The overall survival showed no significant difference between infectious pneumonia and noninfectious interstitial pneumonia (IIP versus nIIP) (P = 0.323). In a multivariate Cox regression model, leukocyte and platelet count were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of IP in HM patients is associated with increased mortality. Of interest, nIIP is a prognostic indicator in patients with lymphoma but not in patients with leukemia.

Therefore, it is crucial to discover novel anticancer drugs to both prevent and treat the disease. In recent years, the advent of combinatorial chemistry allows the design and parallel synthesis of millions of small compounds that have drug-like properties. In vitro high throughput screening of such compound libraries has allowed the identification of many new drug candidates that may be further evaluated for their efficacy and mechanism of action. The overall objective of this study was to identify small molecule compounds as candidates for anti-cancer drug development. We first used cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays to identify compounds exhibiting anti-cancer activity in vitro in a leukemia cell line (K562). Six top compounds selected from the initial screening of a library of 2,560 compounds were further evaluated in multiple cancer cell lines to rank the drug candidates. The top candidate was further investigated to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its anticancer activity.

Here, we assess cell mitochondrial depolarization to proapoptotic signaling BH3-only peptides as a surrogate for the function of Bcl-2 family proteins to address clinical response to cytarabine-based therapy in patients with AML (N = 62). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or bone marrow aspirate specimens were obtained from newly diagnosed patients with AML, viably preserved, and assayed by flow cytometry following BH3 profile assay with individual BH3 peptides. Mann-Whitney analysis indicates biomarker correlation with response to induction therapy: Notably, BIM priming was highly significant (P = 2 x 10(-6)) with a compelling sensitivity/specificity profile [area under curve (AUC) = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.94; P = 2 x 10(-10)]. Multivariate analysis indicates improved profiles for BIM readout + patient age (AUC = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97) and BIM + patient age + cytogenetic status (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.98). When patients were stratified by cytogenetic status, BIM readout was significant for both intermediate (P = 0.0017; AUC = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.04) and unfavorable (P = 0.023; AUC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00) risk groups, demonstrating predictive power independent of cytogenetics. Additional analyses of secondary clinical endpoints displayed correlation between overall survival (P = 0.037) and event-free survival (P = 0.044) when patients were stratified into tertiles by BIM peptide response.

We have accidentally found that the HBME-1 reacts with scattered lymphocytes showing villous surface in hyperplastic lymphoid tissue. To evaluate its reactivity pattern, we have performed a consecutive immunohistochemical study in nonneoplastic bone marrow and lymphoid samples (n = 40), as well as in malignant lymphoproliferations (n = 427), including hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (n = 72), HCL variant (HCL-v) (n = 13), splenic diffuse red pulp small B cell lymphoma (SDRPL) (n = 8), splenic B cell marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) (n = 59), and splenic B cell lymphoma/leukemia, not further classifiable on bone marrow morphology (SBCL) (n = 37) cases. The staining pattern of HBME-1 was compared to DBA.44. HBME-1(+) villous lymphocytes were constantly detected in low number in nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues. With multicolor immunofluorescence staining, HBME-1(+) lymphocytes showed a CD20(+)/CD79a(+)/IgM(+) B cell phenotype. In B cell lymphoproliferations of villous lymphocytes, HBME-1 reactivity was demonstrated in 96 % of HCL, 39 % of HCL-v, 50 % of SDRPL, 12 % of SMZL, and 19 % of SBCL cases. Nodal and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma cases were positive in 12 % of the cases. A small minority (4 %) of the other B cell lymphomas and no T cell lymphoma revealed tumor cell reactivity with HBME-1. In conclusion, our study has established that HBME-1 reacts with a minor subset of B lymphocytes and a small proportion of B cell lymphomas, which has not been described previously. We suggest that HBME-1 can be a useful marker in the diagnosis of HCL and other indolent lymphoproliferations of villous B lymphocytes.",,"['Krenacs, Laszlo', 'Toth-Liptak, Judit', 'Demeter, Judit', 'Piukovics, Klara', 'Borbenyi, Zita', 'Gogolak, Peter', 'Sari, Eszter', 'Bagdi, Eniko']","['Krenacs L', 'Toth-Liptak J', 'Demeter J', 'Piukovics K', 'Borbenyi Z', 'Gogolak P', 'Sari E', 'Bagdi E']","['Laboratory of Tumor Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Derkovits fasor 7-11, 6726, Szeged, Hungary, krenacsl@vipmail.hu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131005,Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HBME-1 antigen)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",,,2013/10/05 06:00,2014/01/30 06:00,['2013/10/05 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00428-013-1490-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2013 Dec;463(6):787-94. doi: 10.1007/s00428-013-1490-5.

CTP-OD1 and CTP-OD2 fusion peptides were expressed from a cold-inducible expression system. Our results demonstrated that both fusion peptides could localize into the cytoplasm, specifically interact with the Bcr-Abl protein and further inhibit growth, induce apoptosis, and decrease the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl in K562 cell lines.

We here studied an alternative strategy for the efficient generation of naive CD8(+) T cells with a single TCR. TCR-transduced human postnatal thymus-derived and adult mobilized blood-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were differentiated to CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive T cells using OP9-Delta-like 1 (OP9-DL1) cultures. Addition of the agonist peptide induced double positive cells to cross-present the peptide, leading, in the absence of co-stimulation, to cell cycle arrest and differentiation into mature CD8(+) T cells. Comprehensive phenotypic, molecular and functional analysis revealed the generation of naive and resting CD8(+) T cells through a process similar to thymic positive selection. These mature T cells show a near complete inhibition of endogenous TCRA and TCRB rearrangements and express high levels of the introduced multimer-reactive TCR. Upon activation, specific cytokine production and efficient killing of tumor cells were induced.

This is in part due to variation in MIA sensitivity among cancer cell lines, the dependency of cell fate on drug concentration and uncertainty about the modes of cell death occurring, thus making comparisons of published reports difficult. To circumvent problems associated with MIAs, we used siRNA knockdown of the anaphase-promoting complex activator, Cdc20, as a defined molecular system to investigate the role, specifically in mitotic death, of individual anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and their phosphorylated forms. We show that Cdc20 knockdown in HeLa cells induces mitotic arrest and subsequent mitotic death. Knockdown of Cdc20 in HeLa cells stably overexpressing untagged wild-type Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 promoted phosphorylation of the overexpressed proteins in parallel with their endogenous counterparts. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL blocked mitotic death induced by Cdc20 knockdown; phospho-defective mutants were more protective than wild-type proteins, and phospho-mimic Bcl-xL was unable to block mitotic death. Overexpressed Mcl-1 failed to protect from Cdc20 siRNA-mediated death, as the overexpressed protein was susceptible to degradation similar to endogenous Mcl-1. These results provide compelling evidence that phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins has a critical role in regulation of mitotic death. These findings make an important contribution toward our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of MIAs, which is critical for their rational use clinically.",,"['Eichhorn, J M', 'Sakurikar, N', 'Alford, S E', 'Chu, R', 'Chambers, T C']","['Eichhorn JM', 'Sakurikar N', 'Alford SE', 'Chu R', 'Chambers TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131003,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Cdc20 Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '156288-95-8 (CDC20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cdc20 Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Mitosis', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2013/10/05 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/10/05 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013360 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.360 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Oct 3;4:e834. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.360.,PMC3824670,,"['R01 CA109821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-109821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that nilotinib-induced apoptosis was reduced by stem cell factor (SCF) addition. Here, the SCF-activated survival pathway was investigated. BCR-ABL expression was accompanied by the activation of the SCF receptor: c-KIT. Nilotinib inhibited this activation that was restored by SCF binding. Parallel variations were observed for mammaliam target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and mTOR complex 1 substrate S6K. The inhibition of mTORC1 restored the response of BCR-ABL cell lines to nilotinib in the presence of SCF. PI3K inhibition restored nilotinib-induced apoptosis. On hematopoietic progenitors from CML patient's bone marrows, mTORC1 inhibition also restored nilotinib sensitivity in the presence of SCF, confirming its involvement in SCF-activated survival pathway. However, this pathway seems not to be involved in the nilotinib-induced resistance of the CML stem cell population. Conversely, PI3K inhibition sensitized both CML progenitors and stem cells to nilotinib, suggesting that, downstream PI3K, two different kinase pathways are activated in CML progenitor and stem cell populations.",,"['Airiau, K', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Josselin, M', 'Jeanneteau, M', 'Belloc, F']","['Airiau K', 'Mahon FX', 'Josselin M', 'Jeanneteau M', 'Belloc F']","[""1] Laboratoire d'Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cibles Therapeutiques, INSERM 1035, Universite Bordeaux Segalen, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, Bordeaux Cedex 33076, France [2] CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Avenue Magellan 33604 Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131003,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2013/10/05 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/10/05 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013309 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.309 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Oct 3;4:e827. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.309.,PMC3824646,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, Tnv-6 reduces chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cell viability with dysregulation of autophagy, without increasing p53-pathway activity. METHODS: Here, we have investigated whether a quiescent phenotype (unique to CLL) determines the Tnv-6 response, by comparing the effects of Tnv-6 on activated and proliferating CLL. We further studied if these responses are p53-dependent. RESULTS: Unlike quiescent cells, cell death in activated cultures treated with Tnv-6 was consistently associated with p53 upregulation. However, p53 acetylation remained unchanged, without caspase-3 cleavage or apoptosis on electron microscopy. Instead, cellular ultrastructure and protein profiles indicated autophagy inhibition, with reduced ubiquitin-proteasome activity. In specimens with mutant TP53 cultured with Tnv-6, changes in the autophagy-associated protein LC3 occurred independently of p53. Cells treated with Tnv-6 analogues lacking sirtuin inhibitory activity had attenuated LC3 lipidation compared with Tnv-6 (P</=0.01), suggesting that autophagy dysregulation occurs predominantly through an effect on sirtuins. CONCLUSION: These cell cycle and p53-independent anti-leukaemic mechanisms potentially offer novel therapeutic approaches to target leukaemia-sustaining cells in CLL, including in disease with p53-pathway dysfunction. Whether targets in addition to sirtuins contribute to autophagy dysregulation by Tnv-6, requires further investigation.",,"['Groves, M J', 'Johnson, C E', 'James, J', 'Prescott, A R', 'Cunningham, J', 'Haydock, S', 'Pepper, C', 'Fegan, C', 'Pirrie, L', 'Westwood, N J', 'Coates, P J', 'Ganley, I G', 'Tauro, S']","['Groves MJ', 'Johnson CE', 'James J', 'Prescott AR', 'Cunningham J', 'Haydock S', 'Pepper C', 'Fegan C', 'Pirrie L', 'Westwood NJ', 'Coates PJ', 'Ganley IG', 'Tauro S']","['Dundee Cancer Centre, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland DD1 9SY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131003,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (tenovin-6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",,,2013/10/05 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/10/05 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013601 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.601 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Oct 29;109(9):2434-44. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.601.

To apply them for extensive studies, integrated analysis of cross-laboratory (cross-lab) data becomes a trend, and thus, choosing an appropriate feature selection method is an essential issue. This paper focuses on feature selection for Affymetrix (Affy) microarray studies across different labs. We investigate four feature selection methods: $(t)$-test, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), rank products (RP), and random forest (RF). The four methods are applied to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer Affy data which consist of three cross-lab data sets each. We utilize a rank-based normalization method to reduce the bias from cross-lab data sets. Training on one data set or two combined data sets to test the remaining data set(s) are both considered. Balanced accuracy is used for prediction evaluation. This study provides comprehensive comparisons of the four feature selection methods in cross-lab microarray analysis. Results show that SAM has the best classification performance. RF also gets high classification accuracy, but it is not as stable as SAM. The most naive method is $(t)$-test, but its performance is the worst among the four methods.

In particular, this type of allograft is associated with the enormous advantage of offering an immediate transplant treatment to virtually all pediatric patients without an HLA-matched donor, whether related or unrelated, or a suitable umbilical cord blood unit. Several studies have shown that in patients given a T-cell depleted transplant relevant part of the anti-leukemia effect is mediated by alloreactive (i.e. KIR/HLA mismatched) Natural Killer cells originated from donor hematopoietic stem cells. After infusion of positively selected hematopoietic stem cell, fully functioning Natural Killer cells emerge in the recipient peripheral blood, persisting over time, only several weeks after the allograft. We have developed a new method of T-cell depletion (based on the physical elimination of mature T cells carrying alpha and beta chains of the T-cell receptor), which permits to maintain mature donor-derived alloreactive Natural Killer cells and gammadelta(+) T cells in the graft. We, thus, started a formal study in children with hematological disorders aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of this approach.

BCR-ABL1 point mutations are the principal cause of resistance to treatment; however other mechanisms could be involved in failure to TKI therapy. LYN is a src kinase protein that regulates survival and responsiveness of tumor cells by a BCR-ABL1 independent mechanism. PTEN tumor suppressor gene is downregulated by BCR-ABL1 in CML stem cells and its deletion is associated with acceleration of disease. In this study we evaluated the expression of LYN, PTEN and the ratio of both genes in 40 healthy donors (HD) and in 139 CML patients; 88 of them resistant to TKI in different phases of disease and 51 in chronic phase classified as optimal responders (OR) to TKI [40 treated with imatinib or nilotinib (OR-IN) and 11 treated with dasatinib (OR-D) therapy]. When we analyzed the gene expression values of LYN, an increase was observed only in advanced stages of the disease, however, when we analyzed the ratio between LYN and PTEN genes, the group of resistant patients in chronic phase in imatinib or nilotinib treatment (CP-IN) also showed a significant increase. Resistant patients treated with dasatinib, a src kinase inhibitor, presented a similar ratio to the observed in HD. In addition, the LYN/PTEN ratio and the LYN expression showed a direct significant correlation with BCR-ABL1 transcript levels in unmutated resistant patients treated with non-src kinase inhibitors. We were able to identify 8/35 (23%) of cases in CP-IN and 4/12 (33%) in accelerated phase and blast phase (AP/BC-IN), in which resistance could be associated with an increase in the ratio of the LYN/PTEN. Our data suggest that the LYN/PTEN expression ratio may be a sensitive monitor of disease progression in unmutated CML patients under imatinib or nilotinib treatment. This ratio could detect cases when resistance is related to altered LYN expression, suggesting that the treatment change to a src kinase inhibitor would be most suitable to overcome resistance.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Ferri, Cristian', 'Bianchini, Michele', 'Bengio, Raquel', 'Larripa, Irene']","['Ferri C', 'Bianchini M', 'Bengio R', 'Larripa I']","['Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas (IIHEMA), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Argentina; Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas (IIHEMA), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Over-expression of the intracellular Notch1 domain (ICN1) in murine hematopoietic cells is able to induce robust T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in mice. Here we explored the drug sensitivity of T-ALL cells in two subpopulations of CD8(+)CD4(+) and CD8(+)CD4(-) cells in Notch1-induced T-ALL mice. We found that Notch1 induced T-ALL cells could be decreased by chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide (CTX). CD8(+)CD4(-) T-ALL cells were more sensitive to CTX treatment than CD8(+)CD4(+) T-ALL cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by CTX treatment was higher in CD8(+)CD4(-) T-ALL cells. T-ALL cells were also inhibited by inhibitor of mTORC1 rapamycin. CD8(+)CD4(+) T-ALL cells were more susceptible to rapamycin treatment than CD8(+)CD4(-) T-ALL cells. Rapamycin treatment selectively arrested more CD8(+)CD4(+) T-ALL cells at G0 phase of cell cycle. A combination of the two drugs significantly improved overall survival of T-ALL bearing mice when compared with CTX or rapamycin alone. These results indicated that CD8(+)CD4(+) and CD8(+)CD4(-) leukemia cell populations had distinct drug sensitivity.,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The prognosis of patients with aggressive ATL remains poor because ATL cells acquire resistance to conventional cytotoxic agents. Therefore, development of novel agents is urgently needed. We examined the effects of resveratrol, a well-known polyphenolic compound, on cell proliferation and survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, MT-2 and HUT-102. We found that resveratrol suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death of MT-2 and HUT-102 cells. Immunoblot analysis showed inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia sequence (Mcl)-1 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP)-2 expression as well as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation at Tyr(705) and Ser(727) in resveratrol-treated cells. We also observed cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in resveratrol-treated cells, indicating that resveratrol induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in MT-2 and HUT-102 cells. In addition, the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 not only induced cell growth arrest and cell death but also activated caspase-3 in MT-2 and HUT-102 cells, indicating that STAT3 may be a therapeutic target for ATL. These results suggest that resveratrol presents a potent anti-proliferative effect in part via the suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and Mcl-1 and cIAP-2 expression in HTLV-1-infected T cells.

We describe a woman with variant AT with two novel mutations in ATM (IVS14+2T>G and 5825C>T, p.A1942V) who died at age 48 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Her mutations are associated with an unusually long life for AT and with a cancer rarely associated with that disease. We also describe two siblings with AOA2, heterozygous for two novel mutations in senataxin (3 bp deletion c.343-345 and 1398T>G, p.I466M) who have survived into their 70s, allowing us to characterize the longitudinal course of AOA2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 71 consecutive AML patients whose CVC was inserted before each chemotherapy cycle for an overall number of 106 CVC placements. In 47/106 insertions, a prophylaxis with 100 IU/kg/day low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered for 7 days after CVC insertion and additional 7 after CVC removal. This unconventional dose of LMWH, although higher than usual, appeared adequate for a short-course approach. LMWH was delivered regardless of the platelet (PLT) count once provided that it should have been maintained above 20 x 10(9)/L by transfusions. RESULTS: Of 106 insertions, we observed 19 (18%) episodes of CRT, 58 (54%) of sepsis and 50 (47%) infections of CVC-exit site with no difference between LMWH and no-LMWH group. Occurrence of CRT was significantly associated with CVC-exit site infections (14/19, p=0.01) and sepsis (16/19, p=0.005) with no difference between LMWH and no-LMWH group. In multivariate analysis, both CVC-exit site infections and sepsis were confirmed to be independent risk factors for CRT development. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study, although based on a small sample size, suggests that the occurrence of CVC-exit site infections and neutropenic sepsis following chemotherapy significantly increases the risk of CRT in AML, independently from the use of LMWH prophylaxis.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Venditti, Daniela', 'Cefalo, Mariagiovanna', 'Sarlo, Chiara', 'Di Caprio, Luigi', 'Di Veroli, Ambra', 'Nasso, Daniela', 'Ceresoli, Eleonora', 'Postorino, Massimiliano', 'Di Piazza, Fabio', 'Colandrea, Giulio', 'Conti, Fabio', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Del Principe MI', 'Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Venditti D', 'Cefalo M', 'Sarlo C', 'Di Caprio L', 'Di Veroli A', 'Nasso D', 'Ceresoli E', 'Postorino M', 'Di Piazza F', 'Colandrea G', 'Conti F', 'Del Poeta G', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.

In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of BV alone (as a natural product) and the synergistic cytological effects of this component in combination with [Pd (bpy) (Pi-Pydtc)]NO3 - a novel palladium complex on human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To investigate the cytotoxic effect of the BV alone and in combination with palladium complex on MOLT-4 cells MTT assay was performed. In order to determine the apoptotic effects of BV separately and in combination with Pd (II) complex on these cells and its ability to induce apoptosis, morphological examination, flowcytometric analysis and caspase-3 colorimetric assay were done. RESULTS: We found that BV induced morphological changes, namely nuclear shrinkage, and inhibited MOLT-4 cell proliferation; both effects were dose- and time-dependent. Flow cytometry by Annexin-V antibody demonstrated that BV induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. Furthermore, BV induced apoptosis independently of caspase-3 in these cells. In addition, we proved a clear synergistic effect of BV on [Pd (bpy) (Pi-Pydtc)]NO3. The apoptotic pathway activated by BV in combination with Pd complex was caspase-3-dependent.

Myelopathy is a rare complication of intrathecal chemotherapy used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We present a 42-year-old female with T-cell ALL who developed a myelopathy primarily involving the dorsal columns. METHOD: Case report and literature review. FINDINGS: Within 24 hours of an injection of intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone, the patient developed ascending lower limb numbness and balance difficulties progressing to the inability to ambulate. Clinical examination showed profound loss of lower limb proprioception and light touch sensation below T5, mild proximal limb weakness, but preserved pinprick and temperature sensation with intact bowel and bladder function. Initial thoracic and lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1 week revealed no abnormalities. However, repeat imaging at 6 weeks showed abnormal signal in the posterior cord with sparing of the anterior and lateral columns, diffusely involving the lower cervical cord through the conus medullaris. Dermatomal somatosensory-evoked potential (DSEP) conduction abnormalities were consistent with thoracic myelopathy. An empiric trial of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids during inpatient rehabilitation more than 6 weeks later produced no significant clinical improvement. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Preferential and persistent dorsal column myelopathy is a distinctive clinical and radiographic presentation of a rare complication of intrathecal chemotherapy. The MRI abnormalities were initially absent, but evolved to consist of multi-level spinal cord T2 and STIR hyperintensity with regional gadolinium enhancement.

Here, we report that the factors governing the degradation of IFI16 and its colocalization with ICP0 are distinct from those of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), a well-characterized ICP0 substrate. Unlike PML, IFI16 colocalization with ICP0 was dependent on the ICP0 RING finger and did not occur when proteasome activity was inhibited. Expression of ICP0 in the absence of infection did not destabilize IFI16, the degradation occurred efficiently in the absence of ICP0 if infection was progressing efficiently, and IFI16 was relatively stable in wild-type (wt) HSV-1-infected U2OS cells. Therefore, IFI16 stability appears to be regulated by cellular factors in response to active HSV-1 infection rather than directly by ICP0. Because IFI16 is a DNA sensor that becomes associated with viral genomes during the early stages of infection, we investigated its role in the recruitment of PML nuclear body (PML NB) components to viral genomes. Recruitment of PML and hDaxx was less efficient in a proportion of IFI16-depleted cells, and this correlated with improved replication efficiency of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1. Because the absence of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) does not increase the plaque formation efficiency of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, we speculate that IFI16 contributes to cell-mediated restriction of HSV-1 in a manner that is separable from its roles in IRF3-mediated interferon induction, but that may be linked to the PML NB response to viral infection.",,"['Cuchet-Lourenco, Delphine', 'Anderson, Gail', 'Sloan, Elizabeth', 'Orr, Anne', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Cuchet-Lourenco D', 'Anderson G', 'Sloan E', 'Orr A', 'Everett RD']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131002,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '148998-64-5 (IFI16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Herpes Simplex/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteolysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/10/04 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/10/04 06:00'],"['2013/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02474-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02474-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Dec;87(24):13422-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02474-13.

To promote lytic infection, the virus must interact with specific cellular factors to evade the host's antiviral defenses. The HSV-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), activates transcription of viral genes, in part, by mediating the degradation of certain cellular proteins that play a role in host antiviral mechanisms. One component of the cellular defenses that ICP0 disrupts is the suborganelle, nuclear domain 10 (ND10), by inducing the degradation and dissociation of the major organizer of ND10, a promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and ND10 constituent, Sp100. Because previously identified domains in ICP0 explain only partially how it directs the degradation and dissociation of PML and Sp100, we hypothesized that additional regions within ICP0 may contribute to these activities, which in turn facilitate efficient viral replication. To test this hypothesis, we used a series of ICP0 truncation mutants and examined PML protein levels and PML and Sp100 immunofluorescence staining in human embryonic lung cells. Our results demonstrate that two overlapping regions within the central N-terminal portion of ICP0 (residues 212 to 311) promoted the dissociation and degradation of PML and dissociation of Sp100 (residues 212 to 427). In conclusion, we have identified two additional regions in ICP0 involved in altering ND10 antiviral defenses in a cell culture model of HSV-1 infection.",,"['Perusina Lanfranca, Mirna', 'Mostafa, Heba H', 'Davido, David J']","['Perusina Lanfranca M', 'Mostafa HH', 'Davido DJ']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20131002,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Autoantigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpes Simplex/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/chemistry/*enzymology/genetics', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/10/04 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2013/10/04 06:00'],"['2013/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02304-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02304-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Dec;87(24):13287-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02304-13.

In particular, primitive leukemia cells, often termed leukemia stem cells, are typically refractory to many forms of therapy. To investigate improved strategies for targeting of human AML cells we compared the molecular mechanisms regulating oxidative state in primitive (CD34(+)) leukemic versus normal specimens. Our data indicate that CD34(+) AML cells have elevated expression of multiple glutathione pathway regulatory proteins, presumably as a mechanism to compensate for increased oxidative stress in leukemic cells. Consistent with this observation, CD34(+) AML cells have lower levels of reduced glutathione and increased levels of oxidized glutathione compared with normal CD34(+) cells. These findings led us to hypothesize that AML cells will be hypersensitive to inhibition of glutathione metabolism. To test this premise, we identified compounds such as parthenolide (PTL) or piperlongumine that induce almost complete glutathione depletion and severe cell death in CD34(+) AML cells. Importantly, these compounds only induce limited and transient glutathione depletion as well as significantly less toxicity in normal CD34(+) cells. We further determined that PTL perturbs glutathione homeostasis by a multifactorial mechanism, which includes inhibiting key glutathione metabolic enzymes (GCLC and GPX1), as well as direct depletion of glutathione. These findings demonstrate that primitive leukemia cells are uniquely sensitive to agents that target aberrant glutathione metabolism, an intrinsic property of primary human AML cells.",,"['Pei, Shanshan', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', 'Callahan, Kevin P', 'Balys, Marlene', 'Ashton, John M', 'Neering, Sarah J', 'Lagadinou, Eleni D', 'Corbett, Cheryl', 'Ye, Haobin', 'Liesveld, Jane L', ""O'Dwyer, Kristen M"", 'Li, Zheng', 'Shi, Lei', 'Greninger, Patricia', 'Settleman, Jeffrey', 'Benes, Cyril', 'Hagen, Fred K', 'Munger, Joshua', 'Crooks, Peter A', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Pei S', 'Minhajuddin M', 'Callahan KP', 'Balys M', 'Ashton JM', 'Neering SJ', 'Lagadinou ED', 'Corbett C', 'Ye H', 'Liesveld JL', ""O'Dwyer KM"", 'Li Z', 'Shi L', 'Greninger P', 'Settleman J', 'Benes C', 'Hagen FK', 'Munger J', 'Crooks PA', 'Becker MW', 'Jordan CT']","['Department of Biomedical Genetics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642; Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021; Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Biomedical Genetics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York 14642; Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045.

The MLL fusion proteins that are expressed in 11q23-AML facilitate transcription of a set of HOX genes, including HOXA9 and HOXA10. Because Hox proteins are transcription factors, this suggests the possibility that Hox target genes mediate the adverse effects of MLL fusion proteins in leukemia. Identifying such Hox target genes might provide insights to the pathogenesis and treatment of 11q23-AML. In the current study we found that Mll-Ell (an MLL fusion protein) induced transcriptional activation of the FGF2 gene in a HoxA9- and HoxA10-dependent manner. FGF2 encodes fibroblast growth factor 2 (also referred to as basic fibroblast growth factor). Fgf2 influences proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitor cells, and increased Fgf2-expression has been described in AMLs. We determined that expression of Mll-Ell in myeloid progenitor cells resulted in autocrine production of Fgf2 and Fgf2-dependent cytokine hypersensitivity. Therefore, our results implicated increased Fgf2 expression in progenitor proliferation and expansion in 11q23-AML. Because small molecule inhibitors of Fgf-receptors are in human clinical trials, this suggested a potential therapeutic approach to this treatment refractory leukemia.",,"['Shah, Chirag A', 'Bei, Ling', 'Wang, Hao', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Shah CA', 'Bei L', 'Wang H', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['From The Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

Here we report that extracellular ROS production is strongly elevated (mean >10-fold) in >60% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and that this increase is attributable to constitutive activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOX). In contrast, overproduction of mitochondrial ROS was rarely observed. Elevated ROS was found to be associated with lowered glutathione levels and depletion of antioxidant defense proteins. We also show for the first time that the levels of ROS generated were able to strongly promote the proliferation of AML cell lines, primary AML blasts, and, to a lesser extent, normal CD34(+) cells, and that the response to ROS is limited by the activation of the oxidative stress pathway mediated though p38(MAPK). Consistent with this, we observed that p38(MAPK) responses were attenuated in patients expressing high levels of ROS. These data show that overproduction of NOX-derived ROS can promote the proliferation of AML blasts and that they also develop mechanisms to suppress the stress signaling that would normally limit this response.

In both tissues analyzed, a progressive, significant increase in the looseness of local chromatin structure, gene expression levels and DNA repair efficiency from MGUS to SMM and finally to MM was observed (all P<0.002). Following ex vivo treatment with melphalan, a gradual suppression of the apoptotic pathway occurred in samples collected at different stages of myelomagenesis, with the severity and duration of the inhibition of RNA synthesis, p53 phosphorylation at serine15 and induction of apoptosis being higher in MGUS than SMM and lowest in MM patients (all P<0.0103).

Differentiation induction is considered an alternative strategy for treating CML. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, induces erythroid differentiation of CML cells through the p38 MAPK pathway. In this study, treatment of the K562 CML stem/progenitor cell line with activin A followed by a subtoxic concentration of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib strongly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis compared with simultaneous treatment with activin A and imatinib. Imatinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis following activin A pretreatment were dose- and time-dependent. Imatinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were also dependent on the pretreatment dose of activin A. More than 90% of the activin A-induced increases in glycophorin A-positive cells were sensitive to imatinib. However, only some of original glycophorin A-positive cells in the activin A treatment group were sensitive to imatinib. Sequential treatment with activin A and imatinib decreased Bcr-Abl, procaspase-3, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL and also induced cleavage of procaspase-3/poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. The reduction of erythroid differentiation in p38 MAPK dominant-negative mutants or by short hairpin RNA knockdown of p38 MAPK decreased the growth inhibition and apoptosis mediated by sequential treatment with activin A and imatinib. Furthermore, the same inhibition level of multidrug resistance 1 expression was observed in cells treated with activin A alone, treated sequentially with activin A and imatinib, or treated simultaneously with activin A and imatinib. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580 can restore activin A-inhibited multidrug resistance 1 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that a subtoxic concentration of imatinib could exhibit strong cytotoxicity against erythroid-differentiated K562 CML cells.",,"['Huang, Yu-Wen', 'Lee, Wei-Hwa', 'Tsai, Yu-Hui', 'Huang, Huei-Mei']","['Huang YW', 'Lee WH', 'Tsai YH', 'Huang HM']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131002,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Progression from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute myelogenous leukemia [AML, 9 (6.12%) AML patients among 147 MDS subjects] was reported in a clinical trial. However, only one (0.15%) case of AML among 653 immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) subjects was reported. Our objective was to determine whether there is currently a safety signal in the FDA files termed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) for AML in ITP patients who receive MPL agonists. METHODS: We conducted a case-controlled study using the FAERS as a source of case and control data. We compared demographic characteristics, such as gender, age and exposure to MPL agonists between AML patients and others among ITP subjects registered between 2002 and 2011. RESULTS: Total of 4,821 ITP subjects were identified, including 62 AML patients. The number of patients treated with romiplostim and eltrombopag was 54 (1.74%) AML patients among 3,102 ITP subjects and nine (1.52%) AML patients among 594 ITP subjects, respectively. It should be noted that all AML patients were exposed to one or more MPL agonists. Another factor associated with AML was male gender. CONCLUSION: We herein report an association between AML and MPL agonist use in ITP subjects. Due to various biases and the incompleteness of the FAERS data, further studies are warranted to determine whether the detected signal is a real risk.

Recent evidence has shown the bone marrow microenvironment in patients with AML to be intrinsically hypoxic. Adaptive cellular responses by leukemia cells to survive under low oxygenation also confer chemoresistance. We therefore asked whether therapeutic exploitation of marrow hypoxia via the hypoxia-activated nitrogen mustard prodrug, TH-302, could effectively inhibit AML growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed the effects of hypoxia and TH-302 on human AML cells, primary samples, and systemic xenograft models. RESULTS: We observed that human AML cells and primary AML colonies cultured under chronic hypoxia (1% O2, 72 hours) exhibited reduced sensitivity to cytarabine-induced apoptosis as compared with normoxic controls. TH-302 treatment resulted in dose- and hypoxia-dependent apoptosis and cell death in diverse AML cells. TH-302 preferentially decreased proliferation, reduced HIF-1alpha expression, induced cell-cycle arrest, and enhanced double-stranded DNA breaks in hypoxic AML cells. Hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species by AML cells were also diminished. In systemic human AML xenografts (HEL, HL60), TH-302 [50 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) 5 times per week] inhibited disease progression and prolonged overall survival.

The structure elucidation was confirmed by spectroscopic methods, including one dimensional (1D)-, 2D-NMR and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The CH2Cl2 fraction and compound 7 exhibit potent cytotoxic effects against HL-60 human leukemia cells with the IC50 of 8.29 microg/mL and 2.70 microM, respectively, comparing to the positive control, mitoxantrone (IC50=6.80 microM). When HL-60 cells were treated with the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction or compound 7, several apoptosis events like chromatin condensation and the increase of the population of sub-G1 hypodiploid cells were observed. Investigations for the possible mechanism underlying the induction of apoptosis showed that CH(2)Cl(2) fraction or compound 7 induced apoptosis through down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax, cleavage of caspase-9, cleavage of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the apoptosis induction of HL-60 cell by CH(2)Cl(2) fraction or compound 7 was attended by the decreasing of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and C-myc. These results indicated that the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction and compound 7 could induce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells via the inactivation of ERK 1/2 and the decrease of C-myc.

The resulting nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The pi-pi planar structure of GNO and the carboxyl groups on the surface of GNO ensured it could act as an excellent substrate for adsorption and polymerization of aniline monomer. Because of the existence of GNO, the electrochemical activities of SPAN were enhanced obviously. Because of abundant sulfonic acid groups, the resulting nanocomposite showed obvious self-redox signal even at physiological pH, which is beneficial for biosensing field. DNA probes with amine groups could be covalently attached to the modified electrode surface through the acyl chloride cross-linking reaction of sulfonic groups and amines. When the flexible probe DNA was successfully grafted, the electrode was coated and electron transfer between electrode and buffer was restrained. Thus, the inner impedance value of SPAN (rather than using outer classic EIS probe, [Fe(CN)6](3-/4-)) increased significantly. After hybridization, the rigid helix opened the electron channel, which induced impedance value decreased dramatically.

While current treatment regimens achieve almost 80% overall survival, long-term side effects of chemotherapeutic agents can be severe. The functional BCL2-938C > A promoter polymorphism is known to influence the balance between survival and apoptosis of malignant hematolymphoid cells. We investigated its usefulness as a marker for treatment stratification for children with ALL. METHODS: We analyzed DNA from 182 children suffering from ALL in this study to determine genotypes of the -938 C > A polymorphism by ""slow-down"" PCR. RESULTS: ALL patients with the BCL2-938CC genotype had an approximately 3-fold higher risk of belonging to a high-risk group. Within the high-risk group, 50% of BCL2-938CC patients were classified as high-risk due to poor prednisone response whereas only 33% of patients with AC and AA genotypes were classified as high-risk for the same reason.

In the first decade of life, 70% of the mediastinal masses are benign whereas malignant tumors are more frequent in the second decade of life. Among the mediastinal masses, lymph nodes are the most common involved structures and could be enlarged due to a lymphoma, leukemia, metastatic disease, or due to infectious diseases as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and others. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 13-year-old Caucasian girl who came to the emergency room with a history of intermittent fever, weight loss and night sweating for at least 1 month. A radiologic image work-up presented an anterior and posterior mediastinal mass. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography presented a high maximum standard uptake value, which directed our decision for mediastinal biopsy for diagnostic elucidation. Histologic examination described the mass as granulomatous tuberculosis. The patient was treated with anti-tuberculosis therapy and developed a full clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The present case report demonstrates that a bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy detected on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is not always a malignant lesion, and in countries where tuberculosis is endemic, this etiology should not be forgotten during clinical investigations.

Methotrexate is a pro-oxidant compound that depletes dihydrofolate pools and is widely used in the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies. Through its effects on normal tissues with high rates of proliferation, methotrexate treatment leads to gastrointestinal mucositis. In rats, methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal mucositis is histologically characterized by crypt loss, callus fusion and atrophy, capillary dilatation, and infiltration of mixed inflammatory cells. The water-soluble dietary fiber sodium alginate (AL-Na) is derived from seaweed and has demonstrated muco-protective and hemostatic effects on upper gastrointestinal ulcers. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of AL-Na on methotrexate-induced small intestinal mucositis in rats. Animals were subcutaneously administered methotrexate at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg once daily for 3 d. Rats were treated with single oral doses of AL-Na 30 min before and 6 h after methotrexate administration. On the 4th day, small intestines were removed and weighed. Subsequently, tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and bromodeoxyuridine. AL-Na significantly prevented methotrexate-induced small intestinal mucositis.

Evidence of the cytotoxicity of Cameroonian plants against cancer cell lines including MDR phenotypes is been intensively and progressively provided. The present work was therefore designed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the methanol extracts of twenty-two Cameroonian medicinal plants against sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines. METHODS: The methanol maceration was used to obtain the crude plant extracts whilst the cytotoxicity of the studied extracts was determined using a resazurin reduction assay. RESULTS: A preliminary assay on leukemia CCRF-CEM cells at 40 mug/mL shows that six of the twenty plant extract were able to enhance less than 50% of the growth proliferation of CCRF-CEM cells.

Distances between SMN locations and RT field edge were estimated along with dose at SMN site. Expected radiation-induced SMN frequency in remote tissues receiving less than 0.1 Gy was predicted using risk estimates based on atomic bombing data.

Because folate status is influenced by both intake and genetic variation, the objective of this study was to explore maternal folate metabolic gene-folic acid fortification interactions and the risk of childhood ALL. The study population consisted of 120 ALL case-parent triads recruited from Texas Children's Cancer Center between 2003 and 2010. For this analysis, we focused on 13 maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR). Prefortification was defined as delivery before January 1997 and postfortification as delivery in or after January 1997. We used a two-step approach to evaluate gene-environment interactions. First, a case-only approach was used, as this design provides greater power in the assessment of gene-environment interactions compared to other approaches. Second, we confirmed all statistically significant interactions using a log-linear approach among case-parent triads. Only one of 13 interactions evaluated was confirmed in step 2. Specifically, mothers with the minor allele of MTR rs1804742 and who delivered during the prefortification period were at a greater risk of having a child with ALL (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.82-2.88), compared to those mothers who delivered during the postfortification period (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.22-2.99, P for interaction = .03). In one of the few studies to evaluate maternal folate metabolic genotype-folic acid interactions, we found limited evidence that the maternal MTR rs1804742 appeared to interact with higher folic acid levels to influence childhood ALL risk.",,"['Lupo, Philip J', 'Dietz, Danielle J', 'Kamdar, Kala Y', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Lupo PJ', 'Dietz DJ', 'Kamdar KY', 'Scheurer ME']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Dan L.

Prognostic factors affecting the clinical outcome in t-AML have not yet been clearly defined; therefore, we evaluated these factors in this study. METHODS: Forty-eight patients diagnosed with t-AML within the past 10 years were enrolled, and their chemotherapy regimens categorized into 4 groups: alkylating agents (AK) only, topoisomerase II inhibitors (TI) and AK, TI only, and others. The prognostic factors affecting clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: Five (10.4%), 21 (43.8%), 9 (18.8%), and 13 (27.0%) patients were treated with AK only, AK and TI, TI only, and others, respectively. Patients with an AML M3 phenotype showed significantly longer overall survival (OS; 55.1 vs. 14.3 months, P=0.040) and disease-free survival (DFS; 61.2 vs. 17.5 months, P=0.049) than other phenotypes. In contrast, patients with a complex karyotype showed significantly shorter OS (7.9 vs. 31.3 months, P=0.008) and DFS (9.5 vs. 38.6 months, P=0.046); additionally, patients with chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities showed significantly shorter OS (9.1 vs. 30.7 months, P=0.011) than other phenotypes. Only the presence of a complex karyotype or AML M3 phenotype retained prognostic impact in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Only the AML M3 phenotype was identified as having a good prognosis, and this might suggest that it exhibits unique clinical features in t-AML patients.

Both are associated with a poor prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only known curative treatment modality for these diseases, but data on outcomes following such treatment are limited. We analyzed the outcomes of patients with MDS/MPN after allogeneic HCT. METHODS: This retrospective study included 10 patients with MDS/MPN who received allogeneic HCT at Asan Medical Center from 2002 to 2010. Of these 10 patients, 7 had CMML, 2 had aCML, and 1 had unclassifiable MDS/MPN. Five patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen (busulfan-cyclophosphamide), and 5 received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. RESULTS: Neutrophil engraftment was achieved in all patients. After a median follow-up of 47.5 months among surviving patients, 4 had relapsed and 5 had died. There was only 1 treatment-related death. The 5-year rates of overall, relapse-free, and event-free survival were 42.2%, 51.9%, and 46.7%, respectively.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Tal1 and Lyl1 play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in the hematopoietic system and are involved in human leukemia. Tal2, which belongs to the same family of transcription factors as Tal1 and Lyl1, is also involved in human leukaemia. However, little is known regarding the expression and regulation of Tal2 in hematopoietic cells. Here we show that Tal2 is expressed in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. Interestingly, we found that usage of the Tal2 promoter is different in human and mouse cells. Two promoters, hP1 and hP2 drive Tal2 expression in human erythroleukemia K562 cells, however in mouse RAW cells only the mP1 promoter is used. Furthermore, we found that Tal2 expression is upregulated during oesteoclastogenesis. We show that Tal2 is a direct target gene of the myeloid transcription factor PU.1, which is a key transcription factor for osteoclast gene expression. Strikingly, PU.1 binding to the P1 promoter is conserved between mouse and human, but PU.1 binding to P2 was only detected in human K562 cells. Additionally, we provide evidence that Tal2 influences the expression of the osteoclastic differentiation gene TRACP.

Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is required for the survival and development of LSCs. Therefore, targeting beta-catenin is considered a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia. The goal of this study was to explore whether cordycepin, an active component of the traditional medicine Cordyceps sinensis, regulates beta-catenin expression in leukemia cells. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we found that cordycepin significantly suppressed cell proliferation in all malignant cancer cells, including U937, K562, A549, HepG2, SK-Hep1 and MCF7 in a dose-dependent manner. However, cordycepin reduced beta-catenin levels in U937, K562 and THP1 leukemia cells and had no effect on other solid cancer cells. In addition, treatment with cordycepin significantly suppressed leukemia colony formation in soft agar assay. Cordycepin enhanced proteasome-dependent degradation and inhibited nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in leukemia cells. Cordycepin-reduced beta-catenin stability was restored by the addition of a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3beta, indicating that cordycepin-suppressed beta-catenin stability is mediated by the activation of GSK-3beta. Furthermore, cordycepin abolished the effect of Wnt3a-induced beta-catenin in leukemia cells. In addition, cordycepin-impaired beta-catenin is regulated by Akt activation but is not significantly influenced by AMPK or mTOR signal pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show for the first time that codycepin selectively reduces beta-catenin stability in leukemia but not in other solid tumor cells. This suppressive effect is mediated by regulating GSK-3beta. A synergistic combination of cordycepin with other treatments should be used as a novel strategy to eradicate leukemia via elimination of LSCs.",,"['Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Lu, Yi-Jhu', 'Yao, Wen-Ling', 'Liu, Tzu-An', 'Tzean, Shean-Shong', 'Shen, Tang-Long', 'Liou, Jun-Yang']","['Ko BS', 'Lu YJ', 'Yao WL', 'Liu TA', 'Tzean SS', 'Shen TL', 'Liou JY']","['Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan ; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130926,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'GZ8VF4M2J8 (cordycepin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,2013/10/03 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/10/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0076320 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-17729 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Sep 26;8(9):e76320. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0076320. eCollection 2013.,PMC3784440,,['EP-C-16-014/EPA/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakage in the MLL gene preferentially occurs within a ~8 kb region that possesses a strong DNA topoisomerase II cleavage site. It has been proposed that DNA topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage within this and other regions triggers translocations that occur due to incorrect joining of broken DNA ends. To further clarify a possible mechanism for MLL rearrangements, we analysed the frequency of MLL cleavage in cells exposed to etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II poison commonly used as an anticancer drug, and positioning of the broken 3'-end of the MLL gene in respect to inherent chromosomal territories. It was demonstrated that exposure of human Jurkat cells to etoposide resulted in frequent cleavage of MLL genes. Using MLL-specific break-apart probes we visualised cleaved MLL genes in ~17% of nuclei. Using confocal microscopy and 3D modelling, we demonstrated that in cells treated with etoposide and cultivated for 1 h under normal conditions, ~9% of the broken MLL alleles were present outside the chromosome 11 territory, whereas in both control cells and cells inspected immediately after etoposide treatment, virtually all MLL alleles were present within the chromosomal territory. The data are discussed in the framework of the ""breakage first"" model of juxtaposing translocation partners.

Differentiation of immature stem/progenitor cells is critical for normal blood cell function. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that interfere with gene expression by degrading messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or blocking protein translation. Aberrant miRNA expression is a feature of leukemia and miRNAs also play a significant role in normal hematopoiesis and differentiation. We have identified miRNAs differentially expressed in AML and BC CML and identified a new role for miR-150 in myeloid differentiation. Expression of miR-150 is low or absent in BC CML and AML patient samples and cell lines. We have found that expression of miR-150 in AML cell lines, CD34+ progenitor cells from healthy individuals, and primary BC CML and AML patient samples at levels similar to miR-150 expression in normal bone marrow promotes myeloid differentiation of these cells. MYB is a direct target of miR-150, and we have identified that the observed phenotype is partially mediated by MYB. In AML cell lines, differentiation of miR-150 expressing cells occurs independently of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) signaling. High-throughput gene expression profiling (GEP) studies of the AML cell lines HL60, PL21, and THP-1 suggest that activation of CEPBA, CEBPE, and cytokines associated with myeloid differentiation in miR-150 expressing cells as compared to control cells contributes to myeloid differentiation.

The restriction of its expression to hematopoietic cells and many solid tumors raised questions regarding its cellular functions. Sequence analysis of the HMHA-1 encoding HMHA1 protein revealed the presence of a possible C-terminal RhoGTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain and an N-terminal BAR domain. Rho-family GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and control cell spreading and migration. RhoGTPase activity is under tight control as aberrant signaling can lead to pathology, including inflammation and cancer. Whereas Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) mediate the exchange of GDP for GTP resulting in RhoGTPase activation, GAPs catalyze the low intrinsic GTPase activity of active RhoGTPases, resulting in inactivation. Here we identify the HMHA1 protein as a novel RhoGAP. We show that HMHA1 constructs, lacking the N-terminal region, negatively regulate the actin cytoskeleton as well as cell spreading.

Finally, we demonstrate that the HMHA1 N-terminal BAR domain is auto-inhibitory as HMHA1 mutants lacking this region, but not full-length HMHA1, showed GAP activity towards RhoGTPases.

Specifically, aberrations in RON signaling result in increased cancer cell growth, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Biochemical events such as ligand binding, receptor overexpression, generation of structure-defected variants, and point mutations in the kinase domain contribute to RON signaling activation. Recently, functional crosstalk between RON and signaling proteins such as MET and EFGR has emerged as an additional mechanism for RON activation, which is critical for tumorigenic development. The RON signaling crosstalk acts either as a regulatory feedback loop that strengthens or enhances tumorigenic phenotype of cancer cells or serves as a signaling compensatory pathway providing a growth/survival advantage for cancer cells to escape targeted therapy. Moreover, viral oncoproteins derived from Friend leukemia or Epstein-Barr viruses interact with RON to drive viral oncogenesis. In cancer cells, RON signaling is integrated into cellular signaling network essential for cancer cell growth and survival. These activities provide the molecular basis of targeting RON for cancer treatment. In this review, we will discuss recent data that uncover the mechanisms of RON activation in cancer cells, review evidence of RON signaling crosstalk relevant to cancer malignancy, and emphasize the significance of the RON signaling addiction by cancer cells for tumor therapy. Understanding aberrant RON signaling will not only provide insight into the mechanisms of tumor pathogenesis, but also lead to the development of novel strategies for molecularly targeted cancer treatment.",,"['Wang, Ming-Hai', 'Zhang, Ruiwen', 'Zhou, Yong-Qing', 'Yao, Hang-Ping']","['Wang MH', 'Zhang R', 'Zhou YQ', 'Yao HP']","['Cancer Biology Research Center, ; Department of Biomedical Sciences, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130730,China,J Biomed Res,Journal of biomedical research,101551157,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Receptor tyrosine kinase (RON)', 'activation mechanism', 'oncogene addiction', 'signaling crosstalk', 'signaling pathway', 'tumorigenesis']",2013/10/03 06:00,2013/10/03 06:01,['2013/10/03 06:00'],"['2013/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7555/JBR.27.20130038 [doi]', 'jbr-27-05-345 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biomed Res. 2013 Sep;27(5):345-56. doi: 10.7555/JBR.27.20130038.

Network biology has emerged as the primary tool for studying systems biology as it utilises the mathematical analysis of the relationships between connected objects in a biological system and allows the integration of varied 'omic' datasets (including genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc.).

Flow cytometry was used to analyze percentages of Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 93 acute leukemia patients (ALL, n = 30; AML, n = 63) and 40 healthy volunteers. Serum levels of IL-17 and IL-21 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

We evaluated usefulness of comparative proteomics (MALDI-TOF) in two subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), M1 and M2, according to FAB classification. The bone marrow or blood cell proteomes were examined in 33 newly diagnosed patients before ""3 + 7"" induction therapy, after treatment and when the disease relapsed. We found that bone marrow and peripheral mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers revealed a number of quantitative and qualitative differences between the two proteomes, reflecting differences in the maturational status of normal cells. Such differences were not detected in our AML M1/M2 patients. Additionally, we found 9 proteins, which are potential biomarkers differentiating between the AML patients and healthy volunteers. Using comparative proteomics, we found that annexin I, glutathione transferase omega, esterase D and gamma 1 actin had prognostic significance. Applying statistical methods, we detected two proteins which might allow to predict results of induction therapy in AML M1/M2. One of them was esterase D, the higher concentration of which was associated with higher complete remission rate, and the other was gamma 1 actin, the higher concentration of which was related to resistance.

In addition, relapse frequently occurs after application of conventional chemotherapy in CLL. Recently several new chemo-free treatment options have been introduced within clinical trials. Among them are monoclonal antibodies, most of them targeting the CD20 molecule: besides the licensed drugs rituximab and ofatumumab obinutuzumab, although in combination with chemotherapy, has recently shown high clinical efficacy in front-line treatment of elderly patients with CLL. Lenalidomide as monotherapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed disease and first data within clinical trials have been generated in the front-line setting. A promising class of novel agents has been designed to block aberrant signaling from the B-cell receptor. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform. Another class of drugs with potential impact for chemo-free treatment strategies in CLL are the BH3-mimetic inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins. Other interesting candidate drugs that are currently explored for CLL patients include small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) proteins (e. g.

In vitro studies showed that midostaurin is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and that midostaurin inhibits and/or induces the same enzyme. Here, we address the clinical relevance of CYP3A4-related drug-drug interactions with midostaurin as either a ""victim"" or ""perpetrator."" METHODS: Three phase I studies in healthy volunteers evaluated the effects of a CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole 400 mg daily for 10 days) or CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin 600 mg daily for 14 days) on concentrations of midostaurin and its metabolites following a single 50-mg dose of midostaurin and the effects of midostaurin as a single dose (100 mg) and multiple doses (50 mg twice daily) on midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 probe) concentration. The plasma concentrations of midostaurin and its 2 active metabolites, CGP62221 and CGP52421, were determined using a sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole increased midostaurin exposure more than tenfold, and induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin decreased midostaurin exposure by more than tenfold. Midostaurin did not appreciably affect the concentrations of midazolam or its metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, at single or multiple doses. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and its metabolites was affected substantially by ketoconazole and rifampicin, suggesting that midostaurin is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.

However, the combination of AsA, a free radical scavenger, with radiation is not clearly understood; conflicting data are reported for cancer cell death. We conducted this study to determine the effect of AsA treatment combined with X-irradiation and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Additive cytotoxic effects were observed when the cells were exposed to 2 Gy X-irradiation after 2.5 mM AsA treatment. When catalase was added to the culture with AsA alone, the cytotoxic effects of AsA disappeared. X-irradiation increased intercellular ROS levels and mitochondrial superoxide levels. By contrast, AsA alone and in combination with X-irradiation decreased ROS levels. However, in the presence of catalase neutralizing H2O2, AsA alone or in combination with X-irradiation only slightly decreased the intercellular ROS. Moreover, AsA decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is commonly associated with apoptosis. These results suggest that the reduction of ROS did not result from ROS scavenging by AsA, and AsA induced apoptosis through a ROS-independent pathway.

Central to this are the multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs) and we have evaluated decision outcomes and financial costs of these. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic patient records of 551 newly referred patients, discussed at 14 tumour site-specific MDMs for adult solid tumours and lymphoma (paediatric oncology and acute leukaemia were excluded) over a 1-month period, a total of 52 MDMs were studied. In addition, the records of a further 81 patients from 10 different MDMs were reviewed where the treating consultant had clearly recorded their opinion of how the patient should be managed and this was compared with the final MDM's consensus view. We also costed the MDMs utilising two different methodologies. RESULTS: The mean age of the 551 patients in the study was 62 years. In all, 536 (97.3%) patients were treatment naive before MDM discussion and 15 (2.7%) had prior treatment. Median time to treatment after the MDM was 16 days. In 535 (97.1%) cases, the MDM discussions were clearly documented, 16 (2.9%) were not clearly documented. In total, 319 (57.9%) patients were discussed once, and 232 (42.1%) were re-discussed (one to six occasions). In 62 (12.7%) patients, there were delays in MDM discussion, 30 (48.4%) were related to radiology, 26 (41.9%) to histopathology and 6 (9.7%) a combination of both. Adherence to the MDM management plan decision occurred 503 times (91.3%) with 48 (8.7%) deviations. In the smaller cohort of 81 patients, the consultant management plan and MDM consensus was compatible 71 (87.6%) times. On four occasions, there were major alterations in management while six were minor. The cost per month of our MDMs ranged from pound2192 to pound10 050 (median pound5136) with total cost of pound80 850 per month and the cost per new patient discussed was pound415. CONCLUSION: Adherence to MDM decisions by health-care professionals occurs in the majority of patients. MDMs are costly, which may have relevance in the currently challenged health-care financial environment. There is a need to improve MDM efficiency without losing the considerable benefits associated with regular MDMs.",,"['De Ieso, P B', 'Coward, J I', 'Letsa, I', 'Schick, U', 'Nandhabalan, M', 'Frentzas, S', 'Gore, M E']","['De Ieso PB', 'Coward JI', 'Letsa I', 'Schick U', 'Nandhabalan M', 'Frentzas S', 'Gore ME']","['Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131001,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['*Decision Making', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Medical Oncology/*economics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*economics/*therapy', 'Patient Care Team/*economics', 'Referral and Consultation/economics']",,,2013/10/03 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/10/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013586 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.586 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Oct 29;109(9):2295-300. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.586.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate into different cell types including neurons; however, the contribution of miR-137 in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells remains unknown. Here, we show that miR-137 is mainly expressed in ES cells at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and highly upregulated during differentiation. We identify that ES cell transcription factors, Klf4 and Tbx3, are downstream targets of miR-137, and we show that endogenous miR-137 represses the 3' untranslated regions of Klf4 and Tbx3. Transfection of ES cells with mature miR-137 RNA duplexes led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and the expression of Klf4, Tbx3, and other self-renewal genes.

METHODS: Human leukemic cell line U-937 (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After 24 h, the cells were treated with NM at 0, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml, in triplicate at each dose. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 100 ng/ml was added to cells to induce MMP-9 secretion. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, MMP expression by gelatinase zymography, invasion through Matrigel, apoptosis by using live green caspase detection kit (Molecular Probe), and COX-2 and COX-1 expression by Western blot. RESULTS: NM had no effect on U-937 cell growth at a concentration of 250 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml and exhibited an antiproliferative effect at 500 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml concentration. Zymography did not demonstrate MMP-2 or MMP-9 secretion in normal cells; however, PMA strongly induced MMP-9, which was inhibited by NM in a dose-dependent manner. Cell penetration through Matrigel was significantly reduced (by 95%) at 250 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml NM and completely blocked at 500 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml NM. NM induced slight apoptosis at 100 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml and moderate at 500 and 1000 capital O, Cyrillicsmall je, Serbiang/ml concentration.

Functional activity is then evaluated using clonogenic assays in methylcellulose or soft agar cultures. Experimental compounds that demonstrate activity in cell culture assays are evaluated in vivo using NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice transplanted orthotopically with human leukemia cell lines. Initial in vivo pharmacodynamic studies evaluate target inhibition in leukemic blasts isolated from the bone marrow. This approach is used to determine the dose and schedule of administration required for effective target inhibition. Subsequent studies evaluate the efficacy of the TKIs in vivo using luciferase expressing leukemia cells, thereby allowing for non-invasive bioluminescent monitoring of leukemia burden and assessment of therapeutic response using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system.

Physical activity in recent years has been a strategy for rehabilitation in cancer patients to remedy disease and treatment related symptoms and side effects. To date, there are no clinical practice exercise guidelines for patients with acute leukemia undergoing induction and consolidation chemotherapy. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine if patients with acute leukemia can benefit by a structured and supervised counseling and exercise program. METHODS/DESIGN: This paper presents the study protocol: Patient Activation through Counseling and Exercise--Acute Leukemia (PACE-AL) trial, a two center, randomized controlled trial of 70 patients with acute leukemia (35 patients/study arm) following induction chemotherapy in the outpatient setting. Eligible patients will be randomized to usual care or to the 12 week exercise and counseling program. The intervention includes 3 hours + 30 minutes per week of supervised and structured aerobic training (moderate to high intensity 70-80%) on an ergometer cycle, strength exercises using hand weights and relaxation exercise. Individual health counseling sessions include a self directed home walk program with a step counter. The primary endpoint is functional performance/exercise capacity (6 minute walk distance). The secondary endpoints are submaximal VO(2) max test, sit to stand and bicep curl test, physical activity levels, patient reported outcomes (quality of life, anxiety and depression, symptom prevalence, intensity and interference). Evaluation of clinical outcomes will be explored including incidence of infection, hospitalization days, body mass index, time to recurrence and survival. Qualitative exploration of patients' health behavior and experiences. DISCUSSION: PACE-AL will provide evidence of the effect of exercise and health promotion counseling on functional and physical capacity, the symptom burden and quality of life in patients with acute leukemia during out patient management. The results will inform clinical practice exercise guidelines and rehabilitation programs for patients undergoing treatment for acute leukemia. Optimizing the treatment and care pathway may ease the transition for patients from illness to the resumption of everyday activities.

Outcomes of treatment of older AML patients have been poor. The advent of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens made allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) an available treatment option with curative intent for older AML patients. Because older patients are often excluded from clinical trials, little is known about the stratification of their risks before allogeneic HCT. While recent studies of RIC and allogeneic HCT have shown little impact of age on outcomes, other variables such as the recipient health status and the AML disease status and chromosomal aberrations have proven to be of prognostic significance. Here, the authors review recent studies of allogeneic HCT for older patients with AML with detailed evaluation of risk factors for relapse as well as non-relapse mortality.

A result of molecular alterations of these pathways is uncontrolled cell growth and survival, ultimately resulting in oncogenic transformation and progression. Aberrant expression of Bcl-2/Bax and MAPK can lead to therapeutic resistance. In this review, the Bcl-2 and MAPK pathways are analyzed, focusing the attention on their molecular alterations, and the complex interactions between these signaling cascades are also analyzed. The observation that both MAPK and Bcl-2/Bax signaling play a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancer suggests that this kinase cascade represents a novel opportunity for the development of new anticancer targeted therapies designed to be less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. The evidence that they are often implicated in sensitivity and resistance to leukemia therapy suggests that characterization of the cancer genome may offer personalized cancer genomic information that can lead to the formulation of much more effective personalized therapy.",,"['Vitagliano, Orsola', 'Addeo, Raffaele', ""D'Angelo, Velia"", 'Indolfi, Cristiana', 'Indolfi, Paolo', 'Casale, Fiorina']","['Vitagliano O', 'Addeo R', ""D'Angelo V"", 'Indolfi C', 'Indolfi P', 'Casale F']","['Pediatric Department, Pediatric Oncology Service, F Fede, II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20131002,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2013/10/03 06:00,2014/05/08 06:00,['2013/10/03 06:00'],"['2013/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2013.827415 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2013 Oct;6(5):587-97. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2013.827415.

To evaluate the clinical significance of serum 2-HG levels in hematologic malignancies, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular, we analyzed this metabolite in distinct types of human leukemia and lymphoma and established the range of serum 2-HG in appropriate normal control individuals by using gas chromatograph-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Indeed, glutamine-related metabolites exhibited a pattern in favor of 2-HG synthesis in the high 2-HG group. In AML patients with cytogenetically normal AML (n = 234), high 2-HG represented a negative prognostic factor in both overall survival and event-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed high serum 2-HG as a strong prognostic predictor independent of other clinical and molecular features.

Analysis of initial events following transduction showed that both oncogenes immediately induced a wide range of enhanced proliferative states, the most extreme of which could generate continuous lines of cells. Maturation defects accompanied the enhanced proliferative states. At all times, the transformed cells exhibited complete dependency on hematopoietic growth factors, particularly GM-CSF and IL-3. Myelomonocytic leukemic cells from primary or transplanted mice formed colonies in semisolid agar. The large majority were dependent on hematopoietic growth factors, but a low frequency of autonomous colonies was also detected. Unexpectedly, reculture of autonomous leukemic colonies generated large numbers of growth factor-dependent clonogenic progeny. Similarly, transplanted clonal autonomous leukemic cells produced leukemias containing a majority of factor-dependent cells. Conversely, recultures of factor-dependent colonies in vitro always produced small numbers of autonomous colonies among the dependent progeny.

Mobilization of the cell cycle in quiescent leukemia stem cells sensitizes them to cell death signals. However, it is unclear that mobilization of the cell cycle can eliminate quiescent cancer stem-like cells in solid cancers. Thus, we explored the use of a genetically-engineered telomerase-specific oncolytic adenovirus, OBP-301, to mobilize the cell cycle and kill quiescent cancer stem-like cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells from human gastric cancer MKN45 and MKN7 cells. We investigated the efficacy of OBP-301 against quiescent cancer stem-like cells. We visualized the treatment dynamics of OBP-301 killing of quiescent cancer stem-like cells in dormant tumor spheres and xenografts using a fluorescent ubiquitination cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI). RESULTS: CD133(+) gastric cancer cells had stemness properties. OBP-301 efficiently killed CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells resistant to chemoradiotherapy. OBP-301 induced cell-cycle mobilization from G0-G1 to S/G2/M phases and subsequent cell death in quiescent CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells by mobilizing cell-cycle-related proteins. FUCCI enabled visualization of quiescent CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells and proliferating CD133(-) non-cancer stem-like cells. Three-dimensional visualization of the cell-cycle behavior in tumor spheres showed that CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells maintained stemness by remaining in G0-G1 phase. We showed that OBP-301 mobilized quiescent cancer stem-like cells in tumor spheres and xenografts into S/G2/M phases where they lost viability and cancer stem-like cell properties and became chemosensitive. CONCLUSION: Oncolytic adenoviral infection is an effective mechanism of cancer cell killing in solid cancer and can be a new therapeutic paradigm to eliminate quiescent cancer stem-like cells.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Yano, Shuya', 'Tazawa, Hiroshi', 'Hashimoto, Yuuri', 'Shirakawa, Yasuhiro', 'Kuroda, Shinji', 'Nishizaki, Masahiko', 'Kishimoto, Hiroyuki', 'Uno, Futoshi', 'Nagasaka, Takeshi', 'Urata, Yasuo', 'Kagawa, Shunsuke', 'Hoffman, Robert M', 'Fujiwara, Toshiyoshi']","['Yano S', 'Tazawa H', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Shirakawa Y', 'Kuroda S', 'Nishizaki M', 'Kishimoto H', 'Uno F', 'Nagasaka T', 'Urata Y', 'Kagawa S', 'Hoffman RM', 'Fujiwara T']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences; Center for innovative clinical medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama; Oncolys BioPharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan; Department of Surgery, University of California San Diego; and AntiCancer, Inc., San Diego, California.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology/virology', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*genetics', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Time-Lapse Imaging', 'Tumor Burden', 'Virus Replication', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2013/10/02 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/10/02 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0742 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0742 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Dec 1;19(23):6495-505. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0742.

Hypomethylation of ZNF423 regulatory sequences and BMP2 signaling result in transactivation of ZNF423alpha and a novel ZNF423beta-isoform encoding a nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex-interacting domain. Aberrant ZNF423 inhibits the transactivation of EBF-1 target genes and leads to B cell maturation arrest in vivo.

Here we demonstrate that the most prevalent, activating mutation, CSF3R T618I, is sufficient to drive a lethal myeloproliferative disorder in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Mice transplanted with CSF3R T618I-expressing hematopoietic cells developed a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by overproduction of granulocytes and granulocytic infiltration of the spleen and liver, which was uniformly fatal.

A total of 1483 patients undergoing transplantation for myeloid malignancies (IV-BU, N = 1025; TBI, N = 458) were enrolled. Cohorts were similar with respect to age, gender, race, performance score, disease, and disease stage at transplantation. Most patients had acute myeloid leukemia (68% IV-BU, 78% TBI). Grafts were primarily peripheral blood (77%) from HLA-matched siblings (40%) or well-matched unrelated donors (48%).

The Programa Espanol de Tratamientos en Hematologia group conducted a trial for patients diagnosed with untreated AML aged 60 years and older, using the combination of clofarabine (20 mg/m(2) x 5 days) plus low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m(2) x 14 days). The protocol was flexible regarding the use of antifungal and antibacterial prophylaxis, and outpatient induction therapy was allowed. Although the planned recruitment goal was 75 patients, only 11 patients were enrolled (median age, 74 years) after observing high toxicity and unacceptable mortality (46 and 73 % at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively). The response assessment showed three CR (27 %), three resistant diseases (27 %), and five induction deaths (46 %). Induction was administered in an outpatient modality in five patients, while antifungal and antibacterial prophylaxis was not given in seven and five patients, respectively. In our context, induction therapy with the combination of clofarabine (20 mg/m(2)) plus LDAC was associated with high toxicity and unacceptable mortality in elderly AML patients, leading to the early interruption of the trial.

DLI, however, carries the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Recipient leukocyte infusion (RLI) induces graft-versus-leukemia responses without GvHD in mice and is currently being explored clinically. Here, we demonstrate that both DLI and RLI, when given to mixed C57BL/6-->A/J radiation chimeras carrying subcutaneous Neuro2A neuroblastoma implants, can slow the local growth of such tumors. DLI provoked full donor chimerism and GvHD; RLI produced graft rejection but left mice healthy. Flow cytometric studies showed that the chimerism of intratumoral leukocytes paralleled the systemic chimerism. This was associated with increased CD8/CD4 ratios, CD8+ T-cell IFN-gamma expression and NK-cell Granzyme B expression within the tumor, following both DLI and RLI. The clinically safe anti-tumor effect of RLI was further enhanced by adoptively transferred naive recipient-type NK cells. In models of intravenous Neuro2A tumor challenge, allogeneic chimeras showed superior overall survival over syngeneic chimeras. Bioluminescence imaging in allogeneic chimeras challenged with luciferase-transduced Neuro2A cells showed both DLI and RLI to prolong metastasis-free survival. This is the first experimental evidence that RLI can safely produce a local and systemic anti-tumor effect against a solid tumor.

We describe a case of a 48-year-old male with refractory acute myeloid leukemia with acute kidney injury associated with clofarabine treatment. We conducted a review of the literature and utilized the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System to identify spontaneous reporting of renal adverse events with this drug in 29 other cases. Since clofarabine inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, we postulate by extrapolation from the animal studies that collapsing glomerulopathy or severe tubular injury or a combination of both may be the mechanism of acute kidney injury observed with this agent.

Furthermore, influence of storage on the PV measurements was assessed and a reference range based on plasma from 585 healthy men and women was established. RESULTS: Imprecision of the free oscillation rheometer was comparable to other viscometers and performance of the instrument was satisfying. The non-parametrical reference range established was 1.22-1.44 mPa s at 37 (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). CONCLUSIONS: We have established a FOR PV reference range to support clinical decision-making.

However, mechanistically little is known regarding their selectivity in killing malignant cells while sparing normal cells. Gene expression-based chemical genomics identified HDACis as being particularly potent against Down syndrome-associated myeloid leukemia (DS-AMKL) blasts. Investigating the antileukemic function of HDACis revealed their transcriptional and post-translational regulation of key autophagic proteins, including ATG7. This leads to suppression of autophagy, a lysosomal degradation process that can protect cells against damaged or unnecessary organelles and protein aggregates. DS-AMKL cells exhibit low baseline autophagy due to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Consequently, HDAC inhibition repressed autophagy below a critical threshold, which resulted in accumulation of mitochondria, production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and apoptosis. Those HDACi-mediated effects could be reverted upon autophagy activation or aggravated upon further pharmacological or genetic inhibition.

METHODS: Ten patients with higher-risk MDS and 12 patients with AML over 65 years of age were enrolled into this study and received oral induction therapy with cytarabine ocfosfate and etoposide. RESULTS: The therapy response rates were 60% in the MDS group and 41.7% in the AML group. The difference in overall survival among MDS and AML patients was not statistically significant. The difference in the median survival times of the responsive and nonresponsive groups, which included MDS and AML patients, was statistically significant (790 and 174 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a comparison of the data of this therapy in elderly higher-risk MDS patients versus elderly AML patients, we conclude that this therapy is well tolerated and can be cost-effective and useful for higher-risk MDS in elderly patients.","['(c) 2013 S.

We conducted experiments to identify the mechanisms involved in the regulatory functions of adrenergic signaling on erythroid differentiation and the expression of hemoglobin genes. The reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is also an important therapeutic option in patients with hemoglobin disorders. We determined that the adrenergic agonists phenylephrine (PE) and isoproterenol (ISO) can induce the production of beta-hemoglobin embryonic 1 (hbbe1) mRNA and protein in adult zebrafish erythrocytes. Elevated levels of HbF mRNA and protein were also observed in human K562 cells after the adrenergic agonist treatments. In addition, elevated levels of histone acetylation were observed in both the PE- and the ISO-treated K562 cells. Additionally, our data further indicate that the induction effects of the adrenergic agonists on HbF synthesis and erythroid differentiation in K562 cells are mainly mediated by the p38 MAPK/cAMP response element binding pathway.

The biosensor has been formulated as an ex vivo assay, designed for peripheral blood or bone marrow cells, which can produce a clinical result within a working day. The nucleoside analogue ara-C is a key agent for treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML); treatment decisions are made rapidly with AML, patients often receiving same-day commencement of chemotherapy. Currently no rapid predictive test is available to select appropriate therapy for patients prior to treatment. Experiments were designed to determine optimal assay conditions using leukaemic cell lines. We observed a significant increase (~15 fold) in bioluminescence signal compared to control after 8-h incubation of the biosensor with ara-C. This corresponded to a >2-log increase in light output per bacterial cell. Interestingly, bioluminescence conferred a survival advantage to the bacteria following ara-C treatment. The assay is sensitive (lower limit of quantitation of 0.05 microM), selective, accurate (</= 15% RE) and precise (</= 15% coefficient of variation) over a linear concentration range of ara-CTP (0.05-0.5 microM), and detection is independent of reaction volume. Recovery of added standard was tested using ex vivo patient leukaemic cells (n=5). Stability studies on lyophilized bacterial biosensor were performed to ensure maintenance of performance over 12 months.

Some chromosomal abnormalities albeit recurrent are rare such as tetrasomy 8 or isochromosome 5p. In addition, erratic chromosomal rearrangements may occur in AML, sometimes unbalanced and also accompanied by other abnormalities. Knowledge on the contribution of rare abnormalities to AML disease, progression and prognosis is limited.Here we report a unique case of acute monoblastic leukemia with gain of i(5)(p10), tetrasomy 8, an unbalanced translocation der(19)t(17;19)(q23;p13.3) and mutated NPM1. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells were examined by conventional karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and mutation analysis at diagnosis and follow-up. At diagnosis we detected trisomy 8, an unbalanced translocation der(19)t(17;19)(q23;p13.3) and mutated NPM1. During the course of the disease we observed clonal evolution with gain of i(5)(p10), tetrasomy 8 and eventually duplication of der(19)t(17;19)(q23;p13.3). By using the der(19)t(17;19) as clonal marker, we found that i(5)(p10) and tetrasomy 8 were secondary genetic events and that tetrasomy 8 had clonally evolved from trisomy 8. CONCLUSIONS: This case of acute monoblastic leukemia presents a combination of rare chromosomal abnormalities including the unbalanced translocation der(19)t(17;19)(q23;p13.3), hitherto un-reported in AML. In addition, our case supports the hypothesis of a step-wise clonal evolution from trisomy 8 to tetrasomy 8 in AML. Reporting and collecting data of rare chromosomal abnormalities will add information to AML disease, progression and prognosis, and may eventually translate to improved patient management.",,"['Paar, Christian', 'Herber, Gabriele', 'Voskova, Daniela', 'Fridrik, Michael', 'Stekel, Herbert', 'Berg, Jorg']","['Paar C', 'Herber G', 'Voskova D', 'Fridrik M', 'Stekel H', 'Berg J']","['Institute of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital Linz, Krankenhausstrasse 9, A-4020, Linz, Austria. joerg.berg@akh.linz.at.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20130930,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,,,2013/10/02 06:00,2013/10/02 06:01,['2013/10/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/02 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-6-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-6-40 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2013 Sep 30;6(1):40. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-6-40.,PMC3852770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethyl 2-amino-6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (CXL017) was recently identified as a promising lead for the treatment of multidrug-resistant leukemia, which elicits its cytotoxic effect, in part, through inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA). Herein initial experiments with SERCA1a and CXL017 demonstrated no significant effect on calcium affinity, competed with ATP, and induced a dose-dependent decrease in ATPase activity. Among all CXLs tested, (-)-CXL017 exhibited the greatest SERCA inhibition with an IC50 = 13.5 +/- 0.5 muM. Inhibitor combination studies were used to assess potential interactions between (-)-CXL017 and well-known SERCA inhibitors: thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone. Surprisingly, (-)-CXL017 exhibited marked synergy with each of the known SERCA inhibitors, whereas all combinations of the known inhibitors yielded additive effects, indicating that (-)-CXL017 may bind at a unique allosteric site. Treatment of parental (HL60) and multidrug-resistant (HL60/MX2) acute myeloid leukemia cells with the known SERCA inhibitors revealed that all of these inhibitors demonstrate selective cytotoxicity (7.7-400-fold) for the resistant cell line. Within the CXL series, a positive correlation exists between SERCA inhibition and cytotoxicity in HL60/MX2 but not HL60. (-)-CXL017 was also shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of thapsigargin in HL60/MX2 cells. Given the elevated SERCA levels and ER calcium content in HL60/MX2, SERCA likely plays a significant role in the collateral sensitivity of this multidrug-resistance cell line to CXL molecules as well as known SERCA inhibitors.",,"['Bleeker, Nicholas P', 'Cornea, Razvan L', 'Thomas, David D', 'Xing, Chengguo']","['Bleeker NP', 'Cornea RL', 'Thomas DD', 'Xing C']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota , 2231 Sixth St. SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate', ')', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",IM,"['Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2013/10/02 06:00,2014/10/30 06:00,['2013/10/02 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp400458u [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2013 Nov 4;10(11):4358-66. doi: 10.1021/mp400458u.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hMSC engraftment on HCC tissues in nude mouse models, and assess the effect on metastatic potential of HCC. METHODS: hMSCs were engrafted into the nude mouse models of high metastatic HCC via the tail vein. The mice in the experimental group were engrafted with hMSCs (5 x 105 cells per mouse) via the tail vein 15 days after inoculation of tumor cells, twice a week, while the animals in the control group were injected with hMSC culture medium (0.2 mL per mouse) via the tail vein. The subcutaneous tumor size was measured using an electronic digital caliper once every 4 days after hMSC engraftment. After 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks of tumor cell inoculation, the mice were killed and the tumors were collected in their entirety. The tumor weights and body weights of mice were measured, and the tumor inhibition rate was calculated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expression of metastasis-related genes including osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and integrin alpha5 subunit (alpha-V) in the mouse models of high-metastatic HCC, and the expression of apoptosis-related genes including B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and caspase 3 in tumor samples. RESULTS: The tumor weight inhibition rate was 26.62% at 2 weeks, 52.00% at 3 weeks, 38.20% at 4 weeks, 31.98% at 5 weeks, and 30.23% at 6 weeks. Tumor tissue weight comparison results were significantly lower in the hMSC engraftment groups than in the control group at the second and third weeks. The expression of metastasis-related factors OPN, BSP and alpha-V gene was downregulated with time. The expression of antiapoptotic gene Bcl2 exhibited an obvious declining tendency, while the expression of apoptotic genes Bax and caspase 3 showed an obvious rising tendency. The expression of alpha-V and BSP significantly correlated positively with the expression of Bcl2, and negatively correlated with the expression of Bax and caspase 3. The tumor inhibition rate was not significantly correlated with the expression of antiapoptotic and apoptotic factors, and alpha-V and BSP factors, though it exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the expression of OPN. CONCLUSIONS: The highest tumor inhibition rate was observed 3 weeks after hMSCs engraftment, and the tumor inhibition rate gradually reduced with the progression of time. The metastatic potential of tumor cells was downregulated after hMSC engraftment and hMSCs induce further tumor cells apoptosis. The decrease in the proliferation ability of tumor cells may induce a decline in metastatic potential in tumor cells.",,"['Li, Tianran', 'Song, Bin', 'Du, Xiangke', 'Wei, Zhengmao', 'Huo, Tianlong']","['Li T', 'Song B', 'Du X', 'Wei Z', 'Huo T']","['Department of Radiology, The 95th Hospital of PLA, PuTian, FuJian Province 351100, China. lizhaoruixin@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130930,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Tumor Burden', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2013/10/02 06:00,2014/04/26 06:00,['2013/10/02 06:00'],"['2013/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['2047-783X-18-34 [pii]', '10.1186/2047-783X-18-34 [doi]']",epublish,Eur J Med Res. 2013 Sep 30;18:34. doi: 10.1186/2047-783X-18-34.,PMC3850116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Preparation of nano-realgar was mechanical milled using a high-energy planetary ball mill. Using drug-sensitive leukemia cells (K562) as target cells, MTT assay was used to detect the proliferating activity of K562 cells, and the cellular apoptosis was investigated with double staining of FITC-Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry (FCM) was employed to detect expression of intracellular Bax, Bcl-2, P-53 protein and the activity of Caspase-3. RESULT: The raw realgar was made to ultra-fine powder by ball milling, and the average diameter of the nanoparticle was (72.72 +/- 22.18) nm measured with electron microscopes. Nano-realgar significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells, Treated for 24, 48 and 72 hours, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 43.48, 20.52, 16.07 mg x L(-1). After exposure to 20 mg x L(-1) and 50 mg x L(-1) nano-realgar for 48 hours, the apoptosis of K562 cells detected by Annexin V/PI staining was increased, the apoptotic rate of K562 cells was 10. 52% and 73.25%. After the target cells were treated with 20 mg x L(-1) and 50 mg x L(-1) nano-realgar for 48 h, the expression of P-53, Bax, Bcl-2 markedly increased in a time and dose-dependent manner. After administration of 20 mg x L(-1) and 50 mg x L(-1) nano-realgar for 48 h, the percentage of BCRP+, P-gp+ and co-expressing P-gp and BCRP cell population in K562 cells incrased dramatically.

Samples were tested for the common respiratory viruses including influenza viruses by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Overall, 6 samples were found positive for influenza A and/or B viruses. Among these positive clinical samples, only one collected sample from a female one-year-old immunocompromised child with leukemia showed a coinfection with influenza A and B viruses. In present study coinfection was confirmed by inoculation of the clinical specimen in specific pathogenfree embryonating chicken eggs and identification of the virus isolates by hemagglutination and one-step RT-PCR.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was employed to measure the expression of BCL2L12 gene in 134 patients with de novo AML. The results were correlated with clinical features of patients. RESULTS: BCL2L12 gene transcript was determined for 134 AML patients and 49 healthy controls, with the median levels measured 0.1029 (0.0119-26.4090) and 0.2677 (0.0173-1.2858), respectively. There was a significant difference in the strength of BCL2L12 gene expression between patients and normal controls (P < 0.01). Those with lower BCL2L12 expression levels had a higher FLT3-ITD mutation rate compared with those with higher levels (27% vs. 5%, P = 0.036). Relapsed or refractory AML patients had lower expression compared with newly diagnosed patients (0.0873 vs. 0.1359, P = 0.014). There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between patients with higher and lower expression levels. However, for AML patients with a normal karyotype, the OS for those with lower expression was significant shorter (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: De novo AML patients have a lower level of BCL2L12 gene expression. AML patients with lower BCL2L12 expression have a higher FLT3-ITD mutation rate, and most of them are relapse or refractory patients. In addition, among patients with a normal karyotype, those with a lower BCL2L12 expression have a shorter OS.

The role of unrelated donor transplantation (URD) in first remission has not been fully determined. We sought to compare directly the outcome of URD allo-HSCT and chemotherapy in patients with high-risk ALL. In this single center retrospective analysis, we included 74 consecutive adult patients with high-risk ALL in first complete remission(CR) and without a sibling donor, in which 32 patients received URD allo-HSCT in CR1 with busulfan-cyclophosphamide preparation regimen and in vivo T-cell depletion with anti-T-lymphoglobulin (ATG). The remaining 42 patients received chemotherapy consolidation and maintenance only in first remission. With median follow-up of 18 months, in the URD allo-HSCT group, the relapse rate(RR) was 30.6 +/- 11.4 % which was significantly lower than that of the chemotherapy group (80.5 +/- 10.1 %,p < 0.001), while non-relapse mortality (NRM) was higher(16.4 +/- 6.7 % vs. 0, p = 0.028). Overall, 3-year leukemia free survival (LFS) was superior in the URD allo-HSCT group compared to chemotherapy group (57.8 +/- 10.6 vs.19.5 +/- 10.5 %, p = 0.002), as was 3-year overall survival(OS, 63.5 +/- 13.3 vs. 31.6 +/- 10.6 %, p = 0.016). URDHSCT was the only factor associated with improved OS, LFS and reduced RR in multivariate analysis. Based on our data, URD allo-HSCT significantly reduced the relapse in high-risk ALL and the benefit translated into improvement in both LFS and OS.

We developed a high-information-content mass spectrometry approach to profile global histone modifications in human cancers. When applied to 115 lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, this approach identified distinct molecular chromatin signatures. One signature was characterized by increased histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation, exhibited by several lines harboring translocations in NSD2, which encodes a methyltransferase. A previously unknown NSD2 p.Glu1099Lys (p.E1099K) variant was identified in nontranslocated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines sharing this signature. Ectopic expression of the variant induced a chromatin signature characteristic of NSD2 hyperactivation and promoted transformation. NSD2 knockdown selectively inhibited the proliferation of NSD2-mutant lines and impaired the in vivo growth of an NSD2-mutant ALL xenograft. Sequencing analysis of >1,000 pediatric cancer genomes identified the NSD2 p.E1099K alteration in 14% of t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1-containing ALLs.

Previous studies showed that miR-29a and miR-29b could function as tumor suppressors in leukemogenesis. However, a comprehensive investigation of the function and mechanism of miR-29 family in AML development and their potentiality in AML therapy still need to be elucidated. Herein, we reported that the family members, miR-29a, -29b and -29c, were commonly downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells derived from AML patients as compared with the healthy donors. Overexpression of each miR-29 member in THP1 and NB4 cells markedly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. AKT2 and CCND2 mRNAs were demonstrated to be targets of the miR-29 members, and the role of miR-29 family was attributed to the decrease of Akt2 and CCND2, two key signaling molecules. Significantly increased Akt2, CCND2 and c-Myc levels in the AML cases were detected, which were correlated with the decreased miR-29 expression in AML blasts. Furthermore, a feed-back loop comprising of c-Myc, miR-29 family and Akt2 were found in myeloid leukemogenesis. Reintroduction of each miR-29 member partially corrected abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis repression and myeloid differentiation arrest in AML BM blasts. An intravenous injection of miR-29a, -29b and -29c in the AML model mice relieved leukemic symptoms significantly. Taken together, our finding revealed a pivotal role of miR-29 family in AML development and rescue of miR-29 family expression in AML patients could provide a new therapeutic strategy.",,"['Gong, J-N', 'Yu, J', 'Lin, H-S', 'Zhang, X-H', 'Yin, X-L', 'Xiao, Z', 'Wang, F', 'Wang, X-S', 'Su, R', 'Shen, C', 'Zhao, H-L', 'Ma, Y-N', 'Zhang, J-W']","['Gong JN', 'Yu J', 'Lin HS', 'Zhang XH', 'Yin XL', 'Xiao Z', 'Wang F', 'Wang XS', 'Su R', 'Shen C', 'Zhao HL', 'Ma YN', 'Zhang JW']","['1] Key State Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China [2].']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130927,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism']",,,2013/10/01 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/10/01 06:00'],"['2013/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2013133 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2014 Jan;21(1):100-12. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.133.

Although complex, the underlying representations of many biomedical data are often sparse. For example, for a certain disease such as leukemia, even though humans have tens of thousands of genes, only a few genes are relevant to the disease; a gene network is sparse since a regulatory pathway involves only a small number of genes; many biomedical signals are sparse or compressible in the sense that they have concise representations when expressed in a proper basis. Therefore, finding sparse representations is fundamentally important for scientific discovery. Sparse methods based on the [Formula: see text] norm have attracted a great amount of research efforts in the past decade due to its sparsity-inducing property, convenient convexity, and strong theoretical guarantees. They have achieved great success in various applications such as biomarker selection, biological network construction, and magnetic resonance imaging.

SUMMARY: Genomic studies in patients at risk of t-APL are relevant to better adapt treatment for the primary disease and to implement monitoring during follow-up and early diagnosis of t-APL. Improved molecular characterization of t-APL may include next generation sequencing approaches to better identify distinguishing features as compared to de-novo APL.

RECENT FINDINGS: Relapse still represents the most common cause of treatment failure, occurring in approximately 15-20% of childhood ALL. Risk-oriented standard salvage regimens are mostly based on combinations of the same agents incorporated in frontline therapies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is largely employed as postremission therapy, being superior to chemotherapy in high-risk patients. With conventional therapies including HSCT, 40-50% of children with relapsed ALL can be rescued. Thus, innovative approaches are needed to further improve the outcome of patients, especially when carrying poor prognostic factors. The last decade has witnessed the development of novel agents, including nucleoside analogues, anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies and bi-specific, anti-CD3/CD19 antibodies, together with new formulations of existing chemotherapeutic agents and targeted molecules, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and FLT3 inhibitors.

A recent study has suggested that Msi2 is strongly expressed in leukemic cells of acute myeloid leukemia patients, and elevated Msi2 is associated with poor prognosis. However, the potential role of Msi2 in leukemogenesis is still not well understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Msi2 knockdown on the biological properties of leukemic cells. High expression of Msi2 was found in K562 and KG-1a leukemic cell lines, and low expression was observed in the U937 cell line. We transduced K562 cells with two independent adenoviral shRNA vectors targeting Msi2 and confirmed knockdown of Msi2 at the mRNA and protein levels. Msi2 silencing inhibited cell growth and caused cell cycle arrest by increasing the expression of p21 and decreasing the expression of cyclin D1 and cdk2. In addition, knockdown of Msi2 promoted cellular apoptosis via the upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, Msi2 knockdown resulted in the inactivation of the ERK/MAPK and p38/MAPK pathways, but no remarkable change in p-AKT was observed. These data provide evidence that Msi2 plays an important role in leukemogenesis involving the MAPK signaling pathway, which indicates that Msi2 may be a novel target for leukemia treatment.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

At present, there are some controversial reports about the Tn antigen (GalNAcalpha-O-Ser/Thr) expression and there is a great lack of information about the [UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-d-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-Ts)] expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To gain insight in these issues we evaluated the Tn antigen expression in CLL patient samples using two Tn binding proteins with different fine specificity. We also studied the expression from 14 GalNAc-Ts genes in CLL patients by RT-PCR. Our results have provided additional information about the expression level of the Tn antigen, suggesting that a low density of Tn residues is expressed in CLL cells. We also found that GALNT11 was expressed in CLL cells and normal T cell whereas little or no expression was found in normal B cells. Based on these results, GALNT11 expression was assessed by qPCR in a cohort of 50 CLL patients. We found significant over-expression of GALNT11 in 96% of B-CLL cells when compared to normal B cells. Moreover, we confirmed the expression of this enzyme at the protein level. Finally we found that GALNT11 expression was significantly associated with the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV), [(2)(1)=18.26; P<0.0001], lipoprotein lipase expression [(2)(1)=13.72; P=0.0002] and disease prognosis [(2)(1)=15.49; P<0.0001].

It was found that non-activated as well as CPR-activated form of MX used at IC90 were able to influence cell cycle of sensitive HL60 as well as resistant cells and induce apoptosis. Interestingly, it was evidenced that HL60/VINC cells were more susceptible to undergo caspase-3/caspase-8-dependent apoptosis induced by both studied forms of MX compared to HL60 and HL60/DOX cells. However, the examined agent did not change the expression of Fas receptors on the surface of HL60 sensitive as well as resistant cells regardless of its form used in the study. Obtained results suggest that CPR-dependent reductive activation of MX does not change its apoptotic stimuli properties in regard to sensitive HL60 and multidrug resistant (HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX) leukaemia cells. Nevertheless, taking into account that side toxic effects observed in course of patient treatment with antitumour drugs are dose-dependent, it seems that the reported increase in antiproliferative activity and ability to induce apoptosis of MX after its reductive activation by exogenous CPR against the MDR cells overexpressing both P-glycoprotein and MRP1 at much more lower concentrations of this drug could be of clinical importance for the treatment of tumours resistant to classical chemotherapy.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We previously demonstrated that C/EBPalpha interacts with the ETS domain of widely expressed GABPalpha, which leads to cooperative transcriptional activation of the myeloid-specific promoter for human FCAR encoding the Fc receptor for IgA (FcalphaR, CD89) in part by facilitating recruitment of C/EBPalpha to the promoter. The C/EBPalpha molecule contains transactivation domains (TADs) at its N-terminus and a DNA-binding and dimerization bZIP structure at its C-terminus. We demonstrate here that GABPalpha interacts with the last 18 residues of the C/EBPalpha C-terminus beyond the bZIP DNA-binding and dimerizing region. Deletion of this C-terminus resulted in loss of GABPalpha interaction but not affecting its DNA binding ability, indicating that it is not required for homodimer formation. Moreover, the C-terminus confers the ability to functionally synergize with GABP on a heterologous TAD when fused to the C-terminus of the VP16 TAD. We identified a three-amino acid stretch (amino acids 341-343) that is important for both functional and protein interactions with GABP. Ectopic expression in K562 cells of C/EBPalpha mutant incapable of interacting with GABPalpha does not induce expression of granulocytic differentiation markers including CD15, CD11b, GCSF-R and C/EBPepsilon, and does not inhibit proliferation, whereas wild type does. These results demonstrate the functional importance of the C/EBPalpha C-terminus beyond the bZIP DNA-binding and dimerization region, which may mediate cooperative activation by C/EBPalpha and GABP of myeloid-specific genes involved in C/EBPalpha-dependent granulopoiesis.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Shimokawa, Toshibumi', 'Nunomura, Satoshi', 'Fujisawa, Daisuke', 'Ra, Chisei']","['Shimokawa T', 'Nunomura S', 'Fujisawa D', 'Ra C']","['Division of Molecular Cell Immunology and Allergology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.

A lot of investments have been done in the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recently gene-modified immune cells have been considered as an alternative approach whenever chemotherapy fails to eradicate the disease. In this sense, AML is a potential suitable target for immunotherapeutic approaches, due to overexpression of several tumor antigens.

Although a number of studies have identified regulators in the morphogenesis of the myocardium, relatively little is known about the molecules that control endocardial morphogenesis. Prior work has implicated the bHLH transcription factor Tal1 in endocardial tube formation: in zebrafish embryos lacking Tal1, endocardial cells form a disorganized mass within the ventricle and do not populate the atrium. Through blastomere transplantation, we find that tal1 plays a cell-autonomous role in regulating endocardial extension, suggesting that Tal1 activity influences the behavior of individual endocardial cells. The defects in endocardial behavior in tal1-deficient embryos originate during the earliest steps of endocardial morphogenesis: tal1-deficient endocardial cells fail to generate a cohesive monolayer at the midline and instead pack tightly together into a multi-layered aggregate. Moreover, the tight junction protein ZO-1 is mislocalized in the tal1-deficient endocardium, indicating a defect in intercellular junction formation. In addition, we find that the tal1-deficient endocardium fails to maintain its identity; over time, a progressively increasing number of tal1-deficient endocardial cells initiate myocardial gene expression. However, the onset of defects in intercellular junction formation precedes the onset of ectopic myocardial gene expression in the tal1-deficient endocardium. We therefore propose a model in which Tal1 has distinct roles in regulating the formation of endocardial intercellular junctions and maintaining endocardial identity.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

(Celastraceae) (S. leptoclada) and to isolate and elucidate the structure of the biologically active compound. METHODS: Bioassay-guided fractionation of the acetonic extract of the stem barks of S. leptoclada was carried out by a combination of chromatography technique and biological experiments in viro using Plasmodium falciparum and P388 leukemia cell lines as models. The structure of the biologically active pure compound was elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Biological screening of S. leptoclada extracts resulted in the isolation of a pentacyclic triterpenic quinone methide. The pure compound exhibited both in vitro a cytotoxic effect on murine P388 leukemia cells with IC50 value of (0.041+/-0.020) mug/mL and an antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine-resistant strain FC29 of Plasmodium falciparum with an IC50 value of (0.052+/-0.030) mug/mL. Despite this interesting anti-malarial property of the lead compound, the therapeutic index was weak (0.788). In the best of our knowledge, the quinone methide pentacyclic triterpenoid derivative compound is reported for the first time in S. leptoclada. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that furthers studies involving antineoplastic activity is needed for the development of this lead compound as anticancer drug.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Asian Pacific Tropical Biomedical Magazine.

Naturally occurring xanthones possess a variety of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer effects. The present study was aimed at investigating the cytotoxicity and the modes of action of three naturally occurring xanthones namely, morusignin I (1), 8-hydroxycudraxanthone G (2) and cudraxanthone I (3) against a panel of nine cancer cell lines, including various sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using a resazurin reduction assay, whereas the caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspases 3/7, caspase 8 and caspase 9 in cells treated with compounds 3. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptotic cells, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well as measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: Compounds 1 and 3 inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines including sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. Compound 2 was active on 8/9 cell lines with the IC50 values ranging from 16.65 muM (against leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 70.38 muM (against hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells). The IC50 value ranged from 7.15 muM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 53.85 muM [against human glioblastoma U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells] for compound 1, and from 2.78 muM (against breast cancer MDA-MB231 BCRP cells) to 22.49 muM (against U87MG cells) for compound 3. P-glycoprotein expressing CEM/ADR5000 cells were cross-resistant to compounds 1 and 2 (4.21- to 610-fold) while no cross-resistance or even collateral cross-sensitivity were observed in other drug-resistant cell lines to the three compounds. Normal AML12 liver cells were more resistant to the three compounds than HepG2 liver cancer cells. Compounds 3 arrested the cell cycle between G0/G1 and S phases, strongly induced apoptosis via caspases 3/7, caspase 8, caspase 9 activation and disrupted the MMP in CCRF-CEM cells. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxicity of the studied xanthones and especially compound 3 deserve more detailed exploration in the future to develop novel anticancer drugs against sensitive and otherwise drug-resistant phenotypes.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

The etiology remains unknown however factors regulating embryo implantation likely contribute. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has roles in extravillous trophoblast adhesion and invasion and is present in ectopic implantation sites. We hypothesised that LIF facilitates blastocyst adhesion/invasion in the Fallopian tube, contributing to ectopic pregnancy. METHODS: We immunolocalised LIF receptor (R) in tubal ectopic pregnancy (N = 5). We used an oviduct cell line (OE-E6/E7) to model Fallopian tube epithelial cells and a trophoblast spheroid co-culture model (HTR-8/SVneo cell line formed spheroids) to model blastocyst attachment to the Fallopian tube. We examined LIF signaling pathways in OE-E6/E7 cells by Western blot. The effect of LIF and LIF inhibition (using a novel LIF inhibitor, PEGLA) on first-trimester placental outgrowth was determined. RESULTS: LIFR localised to villous and extravillous trophoblast and Fallopian tube epithelium in ectopic pregnancy. LIF activated STAT3 but not the ERK pathway in OE-E6/E7 cells. LIF stimulated HTR-8/SVneo spheroid adhesion to OE-E6/E7 cells which was significantly reduced after PEGLA treatment. LIF promoted placental explants outgrowth, while co-treatment with PEGLA blocked outgrowth. DISCUSSION: Our data suggests LIF facilitates the development of ectopic pregnancy by stimulating blastocyst adhesion and trophoblast outgrowth from placental explants. Ectopic pregnancy is usually diagnosed after 6 weeks of pregnancy, therefore PEGLA may be useful in targeting trophoblast growth/invasion. CONCLUSION: LIF may contribute to the development of ectopic pregnancies and that pharmacologically targeting LIF-mediated trophoblast outgrowth may be useful as a treatment for ectopic pregnancy.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) may be the best treatment option for relapsed/refractory ALL. However, the outcome of allo-HSCT is very poor when a patient is not in CR. Quiescent leukemia cells protect them from the commonly used cell cycle-specific chemotherapeutic agents. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a very well characterized T cell growth factor, is responsible for the progression of T lymphocytes from the G0 to the S phase of the cell cycle. IL-2 receptors are present on malignant T cells. Interaction of IL-2 with the IL-2 receptor triggers T cell proliferation, but T cells must change from a resting to an activated state, which leads to the de novo synthesis of IL-2 and expression of the IL-2 receptor. Thus, exogenous IL-2 administration is pivotal for the activation of T cells.

CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS: Among 263 individuals treated with allo-HSCT for severe aplastic anemia, pure white cell aplasia, T-prolymphocytic leukemia, and relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, we diagnosed EBV-PTLD in 5 patients. Median age was 29 years (range 19-70 years) and four of five patients were EBV-seropositive prior to HSCT. All five had unrelated EBV-positive donors. In all cases, PTLD occurred within the first year post-transplant (median 4 months). INTERVENTION: There were two rapidly fatal courses with extensive organ involvement. Both patients showed lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. In contrast, the three surviving patients had higher lymphocytes and normal platelet counts, while PTLD was restricted to one site and resolved after 2-4 cycles of rituximab.

Coagulation disorders can be induced and worsened by cytotoxic drugs; however, the mechanisms are largely unknown. Our study aims to investigate the effects of daunorubicin (DNR) and L-asparaginase (L-ASP) on phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and the procoagulant activity (PCA) of Jurkat/ALL cells. The anticoagulant properties of lactadherin were also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Jurkat cells and cells from 10 newly diagnosed patients with ALL were treated with DNR or L-ASP. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to quantify and locate PS exposure, respectively. PCA was evaluated using coagulation assays and purified coagulation complex assays. Lactadherin, a glycoprotein of the milk fat globule membrane with stereospecific binding to phosphatidyl-L-serine, was used as a probe for the detection of exposed PS. RESULTS: Untreated Jurkat/ALL cells exhibited higher PS exposure and greater PCA than mononuclear cells (MNCs). The PCA of cells treated with DNR or L-ASP was markedly increased. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy indicated that the increased PCA occurred in parallel with PS exposure. The blocking of PS with lactadherin prolonged the coagulation time and inhibited approximately 85-90% of the activities of procoagulant enzyme complexes in Jurkat/ALL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that DNR and L-ASP increased the PCA of Jurkat/ALL cells through PS exposure and played a critical role in inducing thrombosis in ALL patients. Lactadherin is an ideal probe for PS detection at an early stage and a potential anticoagulant to improve the hypercoagulability of ALL patients.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Dong, Xiushuai', 'Shi, Jialan', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Chen, Xi', 'Jin, Yinglan', 'Zhang, Xiaomin', 'Li, Xiaoyun', 'Dai, Haibin', 'Wang, Jinghua']","['Dong X', 'Shi J', 'Zhou J', 'Chen X', 'Jin Y', 'Zhang X', 'Li X', 'Dai H', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130913,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Thrombosis/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'APL', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BSA', 'Chemotherapy', 'DNR', 'L-ASP', 'L-asparaginase', 'Lactadherin', 'MNCs', 'PCA', 'PPP', 'PS', 'Phosphatidylserine', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'bovine serum albumin', 'daunorubicin', 'mononuclear cells', 'phosphatidylserine', 'platelet-poor plasma', 'procoagulant activity']",2013/10/01 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/10/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(13)00410-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2013.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2013 Nov;132(5):614-20. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2013.09.010.

METHODS: Isolated CNS recurrence was documented in 34 patients: there were 18, 6, and 10 patients with meningeal involvement type (type A), cranial nerve palsy type (type B), and myeloid sarcoma type (type C), respectively. For patients with type A, intrathecal chemotherapy was the predominant strategy. For type B, systemic HD-Ara-C with four cycles was the main treatment. For type C, cranial irradiation or craniospinal irradiation was adopted and two cycles of HD-Ara-C were given after the irradiation. RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS recurrence was 12.8%. There was a significantly higher WBC count (32.6 approximately 60.8 x 10(9)/l) in patients at first diagnosis who developed CNS recurrence (all of the three types) compared with patients with no CNS recurrence (10.1 x 10(9)/l) (P = 0.005). We found that a significantly more patients with AML-M5 and 11q23 abnormalities developed CNS recurrence in type A (P < 0.001, 0.005). Twenty-four out of 34 patients (70.6%) with CNS recurrence achieved CNS complete remission at a median of 58 days (range, 30-120). The 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival estimates for all CNS recurrence patients were 21.6 and 25.3%, respectively.

Exons 7 and 9 of WT1 were screened in samples from 216 adult NK-AML using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques. Twenty-three patients (10.6%) harbored WT1 mutations. Younger ages and higher marrow blasts were significantly associated with WT1 mutations (P = 0.006 and 0.003 respectively). Complete remission rates were significantly lower in patients with WT1 mutations than those with WT1 wild-type (P = 0.015). Resistance, relapse, and mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with WT1 mutations than those without (P = 0.041, 0.016, and 0.008 respectively). WT1 mutations were inversely associated with NPM1 mutations (P = 0.007). Patients with WT1 mutations had worse disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P < 0.001) than patients with WT1 wild-type.

METHODS: A meta-analysis of six studies was performed. Among 415 included cases, 165 cases were in the ATRA + ATO group, 129 cases in the ATRA-alone group, and 121 cases in the ATO-alone group. The complete remission (CR) rate and incidences of three groups were compared, respectively, between the therapies of ATRA + ATO with ATRA-alone, ATRA + ATO with ATO-alone, and ATRA with ATO. RESULTS: The assessment results showed that ATRA + ATO therapy significantly improved the CR rate and decreased the incidences of cutaneous reaction compared with ATRA-alone (P < 0.05). However, incidence of liver injury was higher in the ATRA + ATO and ATO-alone groups than that in ATRA-alone group (P < 0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS, AIM OF STUDY: The aim of our study was assessment of selected markers of apoptosis and angiogenesis and their potential as new prognostic factors. We evaluated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; furthermore, we quantified expression of type II receptor for transforming growth factor beta (TGFbetaRII) and type 2 receptor for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) on CLL cells using flow cytometry analysis in 75 previously untreated patients with CLL (47 males and 28 females, median age, 65 years, range 38- 82) and healthy donors. RESULTS: We found significantly elevated TNFalpha in patients with CLL compared to the control group (p < 0.0001); high expression of TNFalpha was associated with unfavourable prognosis: significantly higher concentrations were found in patients with Rai highrisk group compared to low and intermediate-risk group (p = 0.0008 and p = 0.0097), with high serum beta2- microglobulin (p = 0.045), massive lymphadenopathy (p = 0.0083), unmutated genes for variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) (p = 0.041) and unfavourable cytogenetic aberrations (p = 0.0014). In addition, patients with progressive CLL had significantly higher TNFalpha than those with stable clinical course (p = 0.0009); time to treatment was significantly shorter in patients with higher TNFalpha (p = 0.0049). Higher TGFbeta1 concentrations were associated with favourable subgroups: with Rai low risk group compared to high risk group (p = 0.011), patients without massive lymphadenopathy (p = 0.041), patients with mutated IgVH (p = 0.012) and ZAP 70 negativity (zeta associated protein of 70 kilodaltons) (p = 0.044). Patients with progressive CLL had significantly lower TGFbeta1 levels than those with stable course (p = 0.0014) and time to treatment was significantly longer in patients with higher TGFbeta1 (p = 0.016). Patients with Rai high risk group had significantly lower TGFbetaRII expression than those with low risk group (p = 0.022). The prognostic significance of FGFR2 was not found. Significant and independent prognostic factors for overall survival were high serum concentrations of TNFalpha and massive lymphadenopathy (p = 0.036, resp. p = 0.047).

METHODS: We expressed DEK-NUP214 in the myeloid cell lines U937 and PL-21 and studied the effects on cellular functions. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that expression of DEK-NUP214 increases cellular proliferation. Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of one of the key proteins regulating proliferation, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, mTOR. This conferred increased mTORC1 but not mTORC2 activity, as determined by the phosphorylation of their substrates, p70 S6 kinase and Akt. The functional importance of the mTOR upregulation was determined by assaying the downstream cellular processes; protein synthesis and glucose metabolism. A global translation assay revealed a substantial increase in the translation rate and a metabolic assay detected a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, as determined by a reduction in lactate production without a concomitant decrease in glucose consumption. Both these effects are in concordance with increased mTORC1 activity. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) selectively reversed the DEK-NUP214-induced proliferation, demonstrating that the effect is mTOR-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the DEK-NUP214 fusion gene increases proliferation by upregulation of mTOR, suggesting that patients with leukemias carrying DEK-NUP214 may benefit from treatment with mTOR inhibitors.",,"['Sanden, Carl', 'Ageberg, Malin', 'Petersson, Jessica', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Gullberg, Urban']","['Sanden C', 'Ageberg M', 'Petersson J', 'Lennartsson A', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Hematology, Lund University, BMC B13, Klinikgatan 26, 221 84 Lund, Sweden. carl.sanden@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130927,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,,2013/10/01 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/10/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-440 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-440 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Sep 27;13:440. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-440.,PMC3849736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms provide the most effective way of miRNA profiling, particularly as expression of different isoforms of miRNA (IsomiRs) can be estimated by NGS. Therefore, it is now possible to discern the overall complexity of miRNA populations that participate in gene regulatory networks. It is thus important to consider different isoforms of miRNA as part of total profiling in order to understand all aspects of the biology of miRNAs. RESULTS: Here next generation sequencing data of small RNAs derived from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients has been used to generate miRNA profiles using a computation pipeline which can identify isomiRs that are natural variants of mature miRNAs. IsomiR profiles have been generated for all the 5p and 3p miRNAs (previously known as major mature miRNA and minor or miRNA*) and the data has been presented as a composite total miRNA transcriptome. The results indicated that the most abundant isomiR sequence of about 68% miRNAs, did not match the reference miRNA sequence as entered in the miRBase and that there is a definite pattern in relative concentration of different isomiRs derived from same precursors. Finally, a total of 17 potential novel miRNA sequences were identified suggesting that there are still some new miRNAs yet to be discovered. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of different isoforms provides a detailed miRnome of a cell type or tissues. Availability of miRnome will be useful for finding biomarkers of different cell types and disease states. Our results also indicate that the relative expression levels of different isoforms of a miRNA are likely to be dynamic and may change with respect to changes in the cell or differentiation status.",,"['Vaz, Candida', 'Ahmad, Hafiz M', 'Bharti, Richa', 'Pandey, Priyatama', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Kulshreshtha, Ritu', 'Bhattacharya, Alok']","['Vaz C', 'Ahmad HM', 'Bharti R', 'Pandey P', 'Kumar L', 'Kulshreshtha R', 'Bhattacharya A']","['School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India. alok.bhattacharya@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130928,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",,,2013/10/01 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2013/10/01 06:00'],"['2012/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-0500-6-390 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-6-390 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2013 Sep 28;6:390. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-6-390.,PMC3851811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro proliferative capacity of AML cells derived from two independent groups was investigated. Cells were cultured under highly standardized conditions and proliferation assayed by (3) H-thymidine incorporation after seven days culture. Patients were subclassified by clustering models, and gene expression profile was examined by microarray analyses. RESULTS: Based on proliferative capacity of the AML cells, three different patient clusters were identified: (i) autocrine proliferation that was increased by exogenous cytokines; (ii) detectable proliferation only in presence of exogenous cytokines; and (iii) low or undetectable proliferation even in presence of exogenous cytokines. Patients with highest proliferative capacity cells had no favourable prognostic impact by NPM-1 mutation. Analysis of gene expression profiles showed that the most proliferative cells generally had altered expression of genes involved in regulation of transcription/RNA functions, whereas patients with high proliferative capacity and internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the FLT3 cytokine receptor gene had altered expression of several molecules involved in cytoplasmic signal transduction.

There is considerable interest in the identification of new treatments, as most current approaches are not curative. While most patients respond to initial chemotherapy, relapsed disease is often resistant to the drugs commonly used in CLL and patients are left with limited therapeutic options. In this study, we used a luminescent cell viability assay based on ATP levels to find compounds that were potent and efficacious in killing CLL cells. We employed an in-house process of quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) to assess 8 concentrations of each member of a 2,816 compound library (including FDA-approved drugs and those known to be bio-active from commercial suppliers). Using qHTS we generated potency values on each compound in lymphocytes donated from each of six individuals with CLL and five unaffected individuals.

We successfully observed the migration of dendritic cells derived from a myeloid leukemia cell line (MUTZ-3) in a soluble chemokine (CCL-19) gradient. Our experiments suggest the utility of microdevices in monitoring dendritic cell chemotaxis in real time and getting important information regarding migration speeds and distances previously not available from conventional chemotaxis assays.

While induction chemotherapy achieves a complete remission in almost 90% of patients, the majority will relapse and die of their disease. Relapsed ALL is associated with a high reinduction mortality and chemotherapy resistance, with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offering the only therapy with curative potential. However, there is no efficacious and well tolerated standard regimen accepted as a ""bridge"" to allogeneic stem cell transplantation or as definitive treatment for patients who are not transplant candidates. Vincristine is an active drug in patients with ALL, but its dose intensity is limited by neurotoxicity, and its full potential as an anticancer drug is thus not realized.

The current clinically established RNR inhibitors have the shortcomings of short half-life, drug resistance, and iron chelation. Here, we report the development of a novel class of effective RNR inhibitors addressing these issues. A novel ligand-binding pocket on the RNR small subunit (RRM2) near the C-terminal tail was proposed by computer modeling and verified by site-directed mutagenesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. A compound targeting this pocket was identified by virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) diverse small-molecule database. By lead optimization, we developed the novel RNR inhibitor COH29 that acted as a potent inhibitor of both recombinant and cellular human RNR enzymes. COH29 overcame hydroxyurea and gemcitabine resistance in cancer cells. It effectively inhibited proliferation of most cell lines in the NCI 60 human cancer panel, most notably ovarian cancer and leukemia, but exerted little effect on normal fibroblasts or endothelial cells. In mouse xenograft models of human cancer, COH29 treatment reduced tumor growth compared with vehicle. Site-directed mutagenesis, NMR, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor studies confirmed COH29 binding to the proposed ligand-binding pocket and offered evidence for assembly blockade of the RRM1-RRM2 quaternary structure.

However, we previously demonstrated that it failed to inhibit BCL2 or induce apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, which are dependent on BCL2 for survival. In contrast, we show here that S1 rapidly increases reactive oxygen species, initiates endoplasmic reticulum stress, and upregulates the BH3-only protein NOXA. The BCL2 inhibitors, ABT-737, ABT-263, and ABT-199, have demonstrated pro-apoptotic efficacy in cell lines, while ABT-263 and ABT-199 have demonstrated efficacy in early clinical trials. Resistance to these inhibitors arises from the upregulation of anti-apoptotic factors, such as MCL1, BFL1, and BCLXL. This resistance can be induced by co-culturing CLL cells on a stromal cell line that mimics the microenvironment found in patients. Since NOXA can inhibit MCL1, BFL1, and BCLXL, we hypothesized that S1 may overcome resistance to ABT-737. Here we demonstrate that S1 induces NOXA-dependent sensitization to ABT-737 in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4).

The purpose of this study was to assess the relative ability of the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) rating process to detect sensory and motor neuropathy as compared to administration of the pediatric modified Total Neuropathy Score (peds-mTNS). METHODS: The ped-mTNS was administered to 60 children/adolescents ages 5-18 undergoing treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, or non-CNS solid tumors. CTCAE v3.0 scores for the same time point were abstracted from the medical record by a separate trained rater. Comparisons were made between scores using descriptive statistics, correlations, and specificity and sensitivity calculations. RESULTS: The median ped-mTNS score was 9 (32 possible), while the median sensory and motor CTCAE ratings were 0 and 2, respectively (4 and 5 possible, respectively). There was no correlation between ped-mTNS and combined sensory and motor CTCAE scores. The only ped-mTNS item with significant correlation to CTCAE scoring was strength testing. Medical record abstraction of CTCAE scores failed to identify sensory neuropathy in 40 % and significant motor neuropathy (manual muscle test grade 3 or worse) in 15 % of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective measures of CIPN using the ped-mTNS identified a far greater proportion of subjects with peripheral neurotoxicity as compared to CTCAE v3.0 sensory and motor neuropathy ratings, and thus we recommend the use of a specific measure of CIPN such as the ped-mTNS.",,"['Gilchrist, L S', 'Marais, L', 'Tanner, L']","['Gilchrist LS', 'Marais L', 'Tanner L']","['Physical Therapy Program, St. Catherine University, 601 25th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN, USA, lsgilchrist@stkate.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130927,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,2013/09/28 06:00,2014/08/07 06:00,['2013/09/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-013-1981-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2014 Feb;22(2):359-66. doi: 10.1007/s00520-013-1981-6.

WES revealed 37-99 deleterious gene mutations per exome with no common affected genes between patients, but with clear overlap in terms of molecular and disease pathways (hematological and dermatological disease). We identified for the first time deleterious mutations in IKZF3, HOXB9, UBE2G2 and ZEB2 in human leukemia. Target sequencing identified 29 recurring genes, ranging in prevalence from 36% for previously known genes, such as TET2, to 12-16% for newly identified genes, such as IKZF3 or ZEB2. Half of the tumors had mutations affecting either the DNA methylation or chromatin remodeling pathways. The clinical analysis revealed that patients with mutations in DNA methylation pathway had a significantly reduced overall survival (P=0.047). We provide the first mutational profiling of BPDCN.

Pharmacologically enforced egress of hematopoietic stem cells from BM, or mobilization, has been achieved by directly or indirectly targeting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Shortcomings of the standard mobilizing agent, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), administered alone or in combination with the only approved CXCR4 antagonist, Plerixafor, continue to fuel the quest for new mobilizing agents. Using Protein Epitope Mimetics technology, a novel peptidic CXCR4 antagonist, POL5551, was developed. In vitro data presented herein indicate high affinity to and specificity for CXCR4. POL5551 exhibited rapid mobilization kinetics and unprecedented efficiency in C57BL/6 mice, exceeding that of Plerixafor and at higher doses also of G-CSF. POL5551-mobilized stem cells demonstrated adequate transplantation properties. In contrast to G-CSF, POL5551 did not induce major morphological changes in the BM of mice. Moreover, we provide evidence of direct POL5551 binding to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo, strengthening the hypothesis that CXCR4 antagonists mediate mobilization by direct targeting of HSPCs.

PCR amplicon generated from in the process was sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: The translocation event in chromosome 9 and 22 could be successfully detected. BCR/ABL dual color, dual fusion probe generated a classical balanced translocation scenario within the nucleus of affected cells and presented a '1O1G2F' signal pattern.

Further investigation revealed presence of the rare e14a3 (b3a3) fusion. DISCUSSION: This is the first report of rare e14a3 fusion in the BCR ABL gene in a CML patient from India. The observation indicates the need for interrogating rare BCR ABL fusions when common breakpoint cluster regions are absent such that minimal residual disease (MRD), critical for disease monitoring, can be performed and false positive remission cases can be avoided. It also emphasizes the utility and significance of cytogenetics and FISH techniques in primary diagnosis of CML and use of RT-PCR based assays only for generating secondary information within special reference to MRD. CONCLUSION: The rare e14a3 (b3a3) fusion of the BCR ABL gene is present in Indian population as demonstrated from this first report and clinical laboratories using commercial kit that do not cover such rare fusions are likely to generate false result thereby declaring complete molecular remission in CML patients under therapy while conducting MRD assay using RT-PCR technology.",,"['Vaniawala, Salil', 'Acharya, Arpan', 'Parekh, Harsh', 'Mukhopadhyaya, Pratap N']","['Vaniawala S', 'Acharya A', 'Parekh H', 'Mukhopadhyaya PN']","['SN Genelab, Surat, Gujarat, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),Analytical cellular pathology (Amsterdam),101541993,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Leukemia', 'b3a3', 'breakpoint', 'e14a3']",2013/09/28 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2013/09/28 06:00'],"['2013/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['C63X4843L575780X [pii]', '10.3233/ACP-130083 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst). 2013;36(3-4):85-92. doi: 10.3233/ACP-130083.,PMC4605808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five Hsa21derived microRNAs (i.e., hsa-miR-99a, let-7c, miR-125b-2, miR-155 and miR-802) are involved in variable phenotypes of DS. However, the changes involved in the genome-wide microRNA expression of DS fetuses under the influence of trisomy 21 have yet to be determined. To investigate the expression characteristic of microRNAs during the development of DS fetuses and identify whether another microRNA gene resides in the Hsa21, Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to comprehensively characterize the microRNA expression profiles of the DS and normal fetal cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs). In total, 149 of 395 identified microRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (fold change >2.0 and P<0.001) and 2 of 181 candidate novel microRNAs were identified as residing within the DS critical region of human chromosome 21 (chr21q22.222.3). Additionally, 7 of 14 Hsa21-derived microRNAs were detected, although not all seven were overexpressed in DS CBMCs compared with the control. Gene ontology enrichment analyses revealed that a set of abnormally expressed microRNAs were involved in the regulation of transcription, gene expression, cellular biosynthetic process and nucleic acid metabolic process. Significantly, most of the mRNA targets in these categories were associated with immune modulation (i.e., SOD1, MXD4, PBX1, BCLAF1 and FOXO1). Findings of the present study provided a considerable insight into understanding the expression characteristic of microRNAs in the DS fetal CBMCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine genome-wide microRNA expression profiles in the DS fetus. Differentially expressed microRNAs may be involved in hemopoietic abnormalities and the immune defects of DS fetuses and newborns.",,"['Xu, Yong', 'Li, Wuxian', 'Liu, Xueyan', 'Ma, Hualin', 'Tu, Zhiguang', 'Dai, Yong']","['Xu Y', 'Li W', 'Liu X', 'Ma H', 'Tu Z', 'Dai Y']","[""Clinical Medical Research Center, Pingshan People's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518118, P.R.

The majority of cases of invasive trichosporonosis occurs in immunocompromised individuals. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of disseminated infection by Trichosporon asahii in a hematology patient. A 52-year-old man diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed a febrile episode during the third cycle of the induction chemotherapy. The blood cultures were positive after 24h incubation, showing elongated structures compatible with fungal elements in the Gram stain. The identification of the fungus as Trichosporon asahii was carried out by the assimilation of compounds of carbon and the amplification and sequencing of the D1/D2 domain and the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA. The fungus was also isolated from the pustular lesions that the patient had in the chest. After treatment with amphotericin B, the patient progressed satisfactorily. CONCLUSIONS: Trichosporon asahii is an emergent pathogen in immunosupressed patients and its presence should not be considered as colonization, as there is risk of invasive infection.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Revista Iberoamericana de Micologia.

Unfortunately, CDK inhibitors developed to date have demonstrated variable efficacy. METHODS: We generated drug-resistant cells by continuous low-dose exposure to a model pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine CDK inhibitor and investigated potential structural alterations for optimal efficacy. RESULTS: We identified induction of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB1 and ABCG2, in resistant cells. Assessment of features involved in the ABC transporter substrate specificity from a compound library revealed high polar surface area (>100 A(2)) as a key determinant of transporter interaction. We developed ICEC-0782 that preferentially inhibited CDK2, CDK7 and CDK9 in the nanomolar range. The compound inhibited phosphorylation of CDK substrates and downregulated the short-lived proteins, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1. ICEC-0782 induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis. The permeability and cytotoxicity of ICEC-0782 were unaffected by ABC transporter expression. Following daily oral dosing, the compound inhibited growth of human colon HCT-116 and human breast MCF7 tumour xenografts in vivo by 84% and 94%, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 143 patients aged >65 years, who received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) (n=49), fludarabine and rituximab (FR) (n=74), or rituximab with chlorambucil (R-CLB) (n=20) as first initial immunochemotherapy. RESULTS: At current follow-up (median: 24 months), the proportion of patients with a clinical response was higher with FCR (75%) than FR (57%) and R-CLB (28%). For FCR, FR, and R-CLB patients, 2-year overall survival (OS) was 94%, 76%, and 73%, respectively, (p=0.14), while 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 90%, 58%, and 30% (p<0.001). In the fludarabine based regimen (FR and FCR) population, higher rituximab doses (500mg/m(2) vs. 375mg/m(2)) correlated with prolonged PFS. CONCLUSION: Despite the retrospective nature of this study, we demonstrate that elderly patients with CLL benefit from frontline immunochemotherapy, and emphasize the importance of maintaining rituximab dose intensity.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The cause of second cancers in LPDs is probably multifactorial, and the relative contribution of treatments, genetic predisposition, and immune dysfunction typical of LPDs is still unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 230 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) to assess the frequency, characteristics, and predictive factors of second cancers and to evaluate whether patients with WM are at higher risk of second cancers compared with an age- and sex-matched control population. RESULTS: In a competing-risk model, the cumulative incidence of solid cancers was 6% at 5 years, 11% at 10 years, and 17% at 15 years, whereas the incidence of hematologic malignancies was 4% at 5 years, 7% at 10 years, and 8% at 15 years. Compared with an age- and sex-matched population, the overall risk of second cancers was 1.7-fold higher than expected (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-2.38; P = .002). Patients with WM were at increased risk for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 8.64; 95% CI, 3.88-19.22; P < .0001), myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) (SIR 9.5; 95% CI, 3.6-25.3; P < .0001), and brain cancer (SIR, 7.59; 95% CI, 1.9-30.4; P < .0001). The risk of a second hematologic malignancy was 5-fold higher in treated than in untreated patients (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Patients with WM are at increased risk of DLBCL, MDS/AML, and brain cancers compared with the general population. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the increased incidence of second cancers is related to treatments, to the immunologic impairment associated with the disease, or to genetic predisposition.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The term autophagy [self (auto)-eating (phagy)] was first introduced in 1963 by Christian de Duve, who discovered the involvement of lysosomes in the autophagy process. Since then, substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanism and signalling regulation of autophagy and several reviews have been published that comprehensively summarize these findings. The role of autophagy in cancer has received a lot of attention in the last few years and autophagy modulators are now being tested in several clinical trials. In the present chapter we aim to give a brief overview of recent findings regarding the mechanism and key regulators of autophagy and discuss the important physiological role of mammalian autophagy in health and disease. Particular focus is given to the role of autophagy in cancer prevention, development and in response to anticancer therapy.

CML evolves through three phases, based on both clinical and pathological features: a chronic phase, an accelerated phase and blast crisis. TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) are the treatment modality for patients with chronic phase CML. The therapeutic potential of the TKI imatinib is affected by BCR-ABL dependent an independent mechanisms. Development of MDR (multidrug resistance) contributes to the overall clinical resistance. MDR involves overexpression of ABC -transporters (ATP-binding-cassette transporter) among other features. MDR studies include the analysis of cancer cell lines selected for resistance.

BACKGROUND: In previous studies, hypertensive outpatients have had modest improvement in overall mortality rate as compared with standard risk groups. While excessive mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and stroke were evident in hypertensive outpatients, the mortality rate of malignant neoplasm was greatly reduced. METHODS: Using database systems of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co, Japan, standard life tables were generated, and ratios or rates for mortality and morbidity of hypertensive outpatients were extrapolated and analyzed. RESULTS: The mortality ratio of all cancers was significantly low, 85% (95% CI: 77%-93%), and the morbidity ratio was significantly increased, 121% (95% CI: 109%-133%). The mortality ratio of each of categorized malignant neoplasm was below 100% except for colorectal cancer (111%, 95% CI: 83%-138%). The mortality ratios of stomach cancer (56%, 95% CI: 41%-72%) and liver cancer (52%, 95% CI: 32%-80%) were significantly decreased. The morbidity ratios of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, and others were over 100%, and was statistically significant in colorectal cancer (140%, 95% CI: 112%-167%) and others (139%, 95% CI: 113%-165%). The differences between the mortality ratio and the morbidity ratio of stomach cancer and others were statistically significant. The relative lethality of all but pancreatic cancer and leukemia were less than 1.0, and there was a positive correlation between the general prognosis of each cancer and the relative lethality.

Polymorphisms in the DNMT3B gene may influence the DNA methylation enzymatic activity of DNMT3B, thereby modulating the susceptibility to AML. Thus, we investigated the association between SNPs in the DNMT3Bgene and their haplotypes with the risk of AML in the Chinese Han population. The DNMT3B genotype was determined by HRM in 317 de novo AML patients and 406 healthy control subjects matched for age and gender. Among the 5 SNPs investigated in this study, rs2424913 demonstrated no polymorphisms in the Chinese Han populations, rs1569686 and rs2424908 were significantly associated with AML risk. The GG genotype of rs1569686 was associated with increased AML risk (OR: 5.76; 95%CI: 2.60-12.73; P<0.01) compared with the TT genotype, and individuals with a G allele had a significantly increased risk (OR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.41-2.52; P<0.01) for AML compared with those harboring a C allele, this polymorphism can predict the risk of AML in a minority of patients. While the CC genotype of rs2424908 appeared to reduce the AML risk (OR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.36-0.91; P=0.01) compared with the TT genotype, individuals with a C allele were associated with a lower risk (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.64-0.97, P=0.03) for developing AML compared with those harboring a T allele.

The CGGT, CTAT, TGAT, and CGAT haplotypes of rs6087990, rs1569686, rs6119954, and rs2424908 appeared to significantly increase the AML risk, and the TTGC haplotype appeared to significantly reduce the risk.

Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gfi1 is an important factor in the initiation and maintenance of lymphoid leukemias and its deficiency significantly impedes Notch dependent initiation of T-ALL in animal models. Here, we show that immature hematopoietic cells require Gfi1 to competently integrate Notch-activated signaling. Notch1 activation coupled with Gfi1 deficiency early in T-lineage specification leads to a dramatic loss of T-cells, whereas activation in later stages leaves development unaffected. In Gfi1 deficient multipotent precursors, Notch activation induces lethality and is cell autonomous. Further, without Gfi1, multipotent progenitors do not maintain Notch1-activated global expression profiles typical for T-lineage precursors. In agreement with this, we find that both lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP) and early T lineage progenitors (ETP) do not properly form or function in Gfi1(-/-) mice. These defects correlate with an inability of Gfi1(-/-) progenitors to activate lymphoid genes, including IL7R, Rag1, Flt3 and Notch1.

The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene is encoded in the minus strand of the proviral DNA and is constitutively expressed in infected cells and ATL cells. HBZ increases the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells by inducing the Foxp3 gene transcription. Recent studies have revealed that some CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells are not terminally differentiated but have a plasticity to convert to other T-cell subsets. Induced Treg (iTreg) cells tend to lose Foxp3 expression, and may acquire an effector phenotype accompanied by the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In this study, we analyzed a pathogenic mechanism of chronic inflammation related with HTLV-1 infection via focusing on HBZ and Foxp3. Infiltration of lymphocytes was observed in the skin, lung and intestine of HBZ-Tg mice. As mechanisms, adhesion and migration of HBZ-expressing CD4(+) T cells were enhanced in these mice. Foxp3(-)CD4(+) T cells produced higher amounts of IFN-gamma compared to those from non-Tg mice. Expression of Helios was reduced in Treg cells from HBZ-Tg mice and HAM/TSP patients, indicating that iTreg cells are predominant. Consistent with this finding, the conserved non-coding sequence 2 region of the Foxp3 gene was hypermethylated in Treg cells of HBZ-Tg mice, which is a characteristic of iTreg cells. Furthermore, Treg cells in the spleen of HBZ-transgenic mice tended to lose Foxp3 expression and produced an excessive amount of IFN-gamma, while Foxp3 expression was stable in natural Treg cells of the thymus. HBZ enhances the generation of iTreg cells, which likely convert to Foxp3(-)T cells producing IFN-gamma. The HBZ-mediated proinflammatory phenotype of CD4(+) T cells is implicated in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated inflammation.",,"['Yamamoto-Taguchi, Nanae', 'Satou, Yorifumi', 'Miyazato, Paola', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Nakagawa, Masanori', 'Katagiri, Koko', 'Kinashi, Tatsuo', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Yamamoto-Taguchi N', 'Satou Y', 'Miyazato P', 'Ohshima K', 'Nakagawa M', 'Katagiri K', 'Kinashi T', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130919,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/09/27 06:00,2015/01/28 06:00,['2013/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1003630 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-13-01005 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2013 Sep;9(9):e1003630. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003630.

In developing B cells, the IL-7R and precursor B cell Ag receptor (pre-BCR) synergize to induce proliferation and the repression of Rag at the protein and mRNA levels for a brief period following successful Ig H chain gene rearrangement. Whereas the mechanism of RAG2 protein downregulation is well defined, little is known about the pathways and transcription factors that mediate transcriptional repression of Rag. Using Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed B cells to model this stage of development, we identified early B cell factor 1 (Ebf1) as a strong repressor of Rag transcription. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of either Ebf1 or its downstream target c-Myb was sufficient to induce Rag transcription in these highly proliferative cells. Ebf1 and c-Myb antagonize Rag transcription by negatively regulating the binding of Foxo1 to the Rag locus. Ebf1 accomplishes this through both direct negative regulation of Foxo1 expression and direct positive regulation of Gfi1b expression. Ebf1 expression is driven by the IL-7R downstream effector Stat5, providing a link between the negative regulation of Rag transcription by IL-7 and a novel repressive pathway involving Ebf1 and c-Myb.",,"['Timblin, Greg A', 'Schlissel, Mark S']","['Timblin GA', 'Schlissel MS']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130925,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ebf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gfi1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Interleukin-7', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2013/09/27 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1301675 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1301675 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Nov 1;191(9):4676-87. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1301675.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) constitute the main cell population that enables cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate the level of Tregs in newly diagnosed CML patients and to correlate it with the patients' clinical, laboratory and molecular data. We also aimed to assess the effect of treatment using tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on Treg levels. METHODS: Tregs were characterized and quantified by flow cytometry in 63 newly diagnosed CML patients and 40 healthy controls. TKI was used in 45 patients with chronic phase CML, and the response to therapy was correlated with baseline Treg levels. RESULTS: The percentages of Tregs were significantly increased in CML patients compared to the controls.

To distinguish and consolidate GvL from GvHD, the anti-human CD4 antibody MAX16.H5 IgG1 was tested in murine GvHD and tumor models. The survival rate was significantly increased in recipients receiving a MAX.16H5 IgG1 short-term (2 h) pre-incubated graft even when tumor cells were co-transplanted or when recipient mice were treated by MAX.16H5 IgG1 before transplantation. After engraftment, regulatory T-cells are generated only supporting the GvL effect. It was also possible to transfer the immune tolerance from GvHD-free recipient chimeras into third party recipient mice without the need of reapplication of MAX.16H5 IgG1 anti-human CD4 antibodies. These findings are also benefical for patients with leukemia when no matched related or unrelated donor is available and provides a safer allogeneic HSCT, which is more effective against leukemia.

Currently, the average rate of non-adherence to oral anti-cancer therapy is estimated at around 21%. In this study, we use the examples of the imatinib treatment against chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the tamoxifene treatment against breast cancer to assess the negative consequences of the non-adherence to therapy in terms of medical outcome and health care cost. One of the main causes of non-adherence to these oral cancer treatments is depression. Surprisingly, this aspect is still relatively unknown to oncologists, while depression has been taken into account for the treatment of other chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes...). We therefore propose that cancer patients should be screened for depression throughout their treatment to improve the adherence to therapy. Cancer patients should have the opportunity to explain their own perception of their disease and their treatment that are key parameters in the onset of depression.

However, endogenous factors involved in the protection against manganese toxicity remain unclear. Previously, we showed that rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells are highly sensitive to MnCl(2) compared with other rat cell lines. To identify the genes involved in resistance to manganese toxicity, two lines of Mn-resistant cells showing resistance to 300 microM MnCl(2) (RBL-Mnr300) and 1200 microM MnCl(2) (RBL-Mnr1200) were developed from RBL-2H3 cells by a stepwise increase in MnCl(2) concentration in the medium. Microarray analyses were carried out to compare gene expression between parental RBL-2H3 cells and RBL-Mnr300 or RBL-Mnr1200 cells. Five genes exhibited more than 10-fold up-regulation in both RBL-Mnr300 and RBL-Mnr1200 cells, and 24 genes exhibited less than 0.1-fold down-regulation in both Mn-resistant cell lines. The S100a9 and S100a10 genes, encoding the calcium-binding S100A9 and S100A10 proteins, respectively, were found among the three most down-regulated genes in both Mn-resistant cell lines. The marked decreases in mRNA levels of S100a9 and S100a10 were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analyses.

Autophagy is a major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins. We have reported recently that autophagy was responsible for amyloid precursor protein cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) degradation and amyloid beta clearance in an Atg5-dependent manner. Here we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which autophagy mediates the degradation of APP-CTF and the clearance of amyloid beta. Through affinity purification followed by mass spectrum analysis, we identified adaptor protein (AP) 2 together with phosphatidylinositol clathrin assembly lymphoid-myeloid leukemia (PICALM) as binding proteins of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Further analysis showed that AP2 regulated the cellular levels of APP-CTF. Knockdown of AP2 reduced autophagy-mediated APP-CTF degradation. Immunoprecipitation and live imaging analysis demonstrated that AP2 and PICALM cross-link LC3 with APP-CTF. These data suggest that the AP-2/PICALM complex functions as an autophagic cargo receptor for the recognition and shipment of APP-CTF from the endocytic pathway to the LC3-marked autophagic degradation pathway.

Major progress has been made in lowering treatment-related mortality by reducing intensity of the conditioning regimen and by improving supportive care (eg, for infectious complications). Accordingly, relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation has become the major cause for treatment failure. Major efforts to prevent or treat relapse are focused on cellular- (T cell, natural killer cell), cytokine-, or antibody-based strategies to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effect or circumvent immunoescape. In the more recent years, new classes of agents have shown activity in several hematological malignancies, and besides their immediate antitumor activity, most of them also possess immune-modulatory qualities that may be useful alone or in combination with adoptive immunotherapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation to enhance graft-versus-tumor effects.

In this study, we determined whether CS1, a surface protein that is highly expressed on MM cells, can be targeted by CAR NK cells to treat MM. We successfully generated a viral construct of a CS1-specific CAR and expressed it in human NK cells. In vitro, CS1-CAR NK cells displayed enhanced MM cytolysis and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production, and showed a specific CS1-dependent recognition of MM cells. Ex vivo, CS1-CAR NK cells also showed similarly enhanced activities when responding to primary MM tumor cells. More importantly, in an aggressive orthotopic MM xenograft mouse model, adoptive transfer of NK-92 cells expressing CS1-CAR efficiently suppressed the growth of human IM9 MM cells and also significantly prolonged mouse survival.

A morphological characteristic of RCCs is an irregular nuclear shape, which is used to index cancer grades. Other features of RCCs include the genetic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene, VHL, and p53 genetic-independent inactivation. An aberrant nuclear shape or p53 suppression has not yet been demonstrated. We examined the effect of progerin (an altered splicing product of the LMNA gene linked to Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome; HGPS) on the nuclear deformation of RCCs in comparison to that of HGPS cells. In this study, we showed that progerin was suppressed by pVHL and was responsible for nuclear irregularities as well as p53 inactivation. Thus, progerin suppression can ameliorate nuclear abnormalities and reactivate p53 in response to genotoxic addition. Furthermore, we found that progerin was a target of pVHL E3 ligase and suppressed p53 activity by p14/ARF inhibition. Our findings indicate that the elevated expression of progerin in RCCs results from the loss of pVHL and leads to p53 inactivation through p14/ARF suppression. Interestingly, we showed that progerin was expressed in human leukemia and primary cell lines, raising the possibility that the expression of this LMNA variant may be a common event in age-related cancer progression.",,"['Jung, Youn-Sang', 'Lee, Su-Jin', 'Lee, Sun-Hye', 'Chung, Ji-Yun', 'Jung, Youn Jin', 'Hwang, Sang Hyun', 'Ha, Nam-Chul', 'Park, Bum-Joon']","['Jung YS', 'Lee SJ', 'Lee SH', 'Chung JY', 'Jung YJ', 'Hwang SH', 'Ha NC', 'Park BJ']","['Department of Molecular Biology; College of Natural Science, Pusan National University; Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (prelamin A)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (VHL protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lamin Type A', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Organelle Shape/genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/09/27 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/09/27 06:00'],"['2013/09/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['25371 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.25371 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Jul 15;12(14):2277-90. doi: 10.4161/cc.25371.,PMC3755078,,,,,['Cell Cycle. 2013 Sep 1;12(17):2721-2.

HTLV-1 causes adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma, whereas HTLV-2 infection is not etiologically linked to human disease. The viral genomes of HTLV-1 and -2 encode highly homologous transforming proteins, Tax-1 and Tax-2, respectively. Tax-1 is thought to play a central role in transforming CD4+ T lymphocytes. Expression of Tax-1 is crucial for promoting survival and proliferation of virally infected human T lymphocytes and is necessary for initiating HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis. In transgenic mice and humanized mouse model, Tax-1 has proven to be leukemogenic. Although Tax-1 is able to efficiently transform rodent fibroblasts and to induce lymphoma in mouse model, it rarely transforms primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes. In contrast, Tax-2 efficiently immortalizes human CD4+ T cells though it exhibits a lower transforming activity in rodent cells as compared to Tax-1.

These genes encode neomorphic proteins that produce the presumed oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Despite the prospect of treating AML and other cancers by targeting IDH mutant proteins, it remains unclear how these mutants affect tumor development and maintenance in vivo, and no cancer models exist to study the action of IDH2 mutants in vivo. We show that IDH2 mutants can cooperate with oncogenic Flt3 or Nras alleles to drive leukemia in mice by impairing the differentiation of cells of the myeloid lineage. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of IDH2 triggers the differentiation and death of AML cells, albeit only with prolonged IDH2 inhibition. In contrast, inhibition of the bromodomain-containing protein Brd4 triggers rapid differentiation and death of IDH2 mutant AML.

The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded by an mRNA of the opposite polarity of the viral genomic RNA, interacts with several transcription factors and is involved in T cell proliferation, viral gene transcription and cellular transformation. Cyclin D1 is a pivotal regulatory protein involved in cell cycle progression, and its depressed expression correlates with cell cycle prolongation or arrested at the G1/S transition. In our present study, we observed that HBZ expression suppressed cyclin D1 level. To investigate the role of HBZ on cyclin D1 depression, we transduced HBZ with lentivirus vector into 293T cells, CEM cells and Jurkat cells. The results of Western blot, RT-PCR and luciferase assays showed that transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter was suppressed by the bZIP domain of HBZ (HBZ-bZIP) through cyclic AMP response element (CRE) site. Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays showed the binding of HBZ-bZIP to CRE-binding protein (CREB), which confirmed that the cyclin D1 promoter activity inhibition via the CRE-site was mediated by HBZ-bZIP. The results suggested that HBZ suppressed cyclin D1 transcription through interactions with CREB and along with other viral protein, HBZ may play a causal role for leukemogenesis.",,"['Ma, Yunyun', 'Zheng, Shangen', 'Wang, Yuanyuan', 'Zang, Wenqiao', 'Li, Min', 'Wang, Na', 'Li, Ping', 'Jin, Jing', 'Dong, Ziming', 'Zhao, Guoqiang']","['Ma Y', 'Zheng S', 'Wang Y', 'Zang W', 'Li M', 'Wang N', 'Li P', 'Jin J', 'Dong Z', 'Zhao G']","['College of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130925,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/06/08 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-013-2706-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2013 Oct;40(10):5967-75. doi: 10.1007/s11033-013-2706-0.

Several new drugs have been approved for CLL treatment (fludarabine, bendamustine, and the monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab, rituximab, and ofatumumab) and many more drugs are in advanced clinical development to be approved for this disease. In addition, the extreme heterogeneity of the clinical course and our improved ability to foresee the prognosis of this leukemia by the use of clinical, biological, and genetic parameters now allow us to characterize patients with a very mild onset and course, an intermediate prognosis, or a very aggressive course with high-risk leukemia.

Because of their unique phylogenetic position of being the most primitive group of vertebrates to possess all the components necessary for an adaptive immune system, the immune regulatory compounds they possess may represent the earliest evolutionary forms of novel compounds with the potential for innovative therapeutic applications. Conditioned medium, generated from short term culture of cells from the epigonal organ of bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), has been shown to have potent reproducible cytotoxic activity against a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro. Existing data suggest that epigonal conditioned medium (ECM) exerts this cytotoxic activity through induction of apoptosis in target cells. This manuscript describes apoptosis induction in a representative tumor cell line, Jurkat E6-1, in response to treatment with ECM at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg/mL. Data indicate that ECM exposure initiates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis through activation of caspase enzymes. Future purification of ECM components may result in the isolation of an immune-regulatory compound with potential therapeutic benefit for treatment of human cancer.",,"['Walsh, Catherine J', 'Luer, Carl A', 'Yordy, Jennifer E', 'Cantu, Theresa', 'Miedema, Jodi', 'Leggett, Stephanie R', 'Leigh, Brittany', 'Adams, Philip', 'Ciesla, Marissa', 'Bennett, Courtney', 'Bodine, Ashby B']","['Walsh CJ', 'Luer CA', 'Yordy JE', 'Cantu T', 'Miedema J', 'Leggett SR', 'Leigh B', 'Adams P', 'Ciesla M', 'Bennett C', 'Bodine AB']","['Marine Immunology Program, Mote Marine Laboratory, 1600 Ken Thompson Parkway, Sarasota, FL 34236, USA. cjwalsh@mote.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130826,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sharks/*metabolism']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['md11093224 [pii]', '10.3390/md11093224 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2013 Aug 26;11(9):3224-57. doi: 10.3390/md11093224.,PMC3806469,,['F32 GM077017/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the large number of the isolated bromotyrosine derivatives, studies focusing on their biological mechanism of action are scarce. In the current study we designed a set of experiments to reveal the underlying mechanism of DT cytotoxic activity against K562 cells. First, the results of MTT cytotoxic and the annexin V-FITC/PI apoptotic assays, indicated that the DT cytotoxic activity is mediated through induction of apoptosis. This effect was also supported by caspases-3 and -9 activation as well as PARP cleavage. DT induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as indicated by flow cytometric assay. The involvement of ROS generation in the apoptotic activity of DT was further corroborated by the pretreatment of K562 cells with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, which prevented apoptosis and the disruption of MMP induced by DT. Results of cell-free system assay suggested that DT can act as a topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor, unlike the clinical anticancer drug, etoposide, which acts as a topoisomerase poison. Additionally, we found that DT treatment can block IKK/NFkappaB pathway and activate PI3K/Akt pathway. These findings suggest that the cytotoxic effect of DT is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction-dependent apoptosis which is mediated through oxidative stress. Therefore, DT represents an interesting reference point for the development of new cytotoxic agent targeting IKK/NFkappaB pathway.",,"['Su, Jui-Hsin', 'Chen, Yu-Cheng', 'El-Shazly, Mohamed', 'Du, Ying-Chi', 'Su, Chiang-Wen', 'Tsao, Chia-Wei', 'Liu, Li-Lian', 'Chou, Yalan', 'Chang, Wen-Been', 'Su, Yin-Di', 'Chiang, Michael Y', 'Yeh, Yao-Tsung', 'Lu, Mei-Chin']","['Su JH', 'Chen YC', 'El-Shazly M', 'Du YC', 'Su CW', 'Tsao CW', 'Liu LL', 'Chou Y', 'Chang WB', 'Su YD', 'Chiang MY', 'Yeh YT', 'Lu MC']","['National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium, Pingtung 944, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130826,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Porifera/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['md11093168 [pii]', '10.3390/md11093168 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2013 Aug 26;11(9):3168-85. doi: 10.3390/md11093168.,PMC3801119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Casticin induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability associated with apoptosis induction and G2/M cell cycle arrest. The addition of SB203580, an inhibitor for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not SP600125 [c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) inhibitor] and PD98059 [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor], abrogated casticin-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis associated with the activation of caspases including caspase-8, -9 and -3. Endogenous p38 MAPK activation was observed in untreated cells based on the detection of the expression levels of phospho-p38 MAPK, whereas casticin did not affect the degree of p38 MAPK activation. Interestingly, the addition of SB203580 suppressed casticin-induced phosphorylation of histone H3, a downstream molecule of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and known to be involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis. More importantly, casticin induced upregulation of intracellular ATP levels. Although casticin induced intracellular reactive oxygen species, antioxidants failed to block casticin-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating that casticin-induced cytotoxicity appears to be independent of reactive oxygen species generation. Based on the fact that SB203580 has been reported to compete with ATP for binding to the active form of p38 MAPK, and consequently blocks the p38 MAPK activity in activating downstream molecules, these results suggest that casticin induces cytotoxicity associated with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cells through the p38 MAPK pathway, in which intracellular ATP levels and phosphorylation of histone H3 play critical roles.",,"['Kikuchi, Hidetomo', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Yuhara, Eisuke', 'Takagi, Norio', 'Toyoda, Hiroo']","['Kikuchi H', 'Yuan B', 'Yuhara E', 'Takagi N', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130920,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '753GT729OU (casticin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2013.2106 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2013 Dec;43(6):2046-56. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2013.2106.

However, a significant number of BCP-ALL patients are still genetically unassigned. Using array-comparative genomic hybridization in a selected BCP-ALL cohort, we characterized a recurrent V(D)J-mediated intragenic deletion of the ERG gene (ERG(del)). A breakpoint-specific PCR assay was designed and used to screen an independent non-selected cohort of 897 children aged 1-17 years treated for BCP-ALL in the EORTC-CLG 58951 trial. ERG(del) was found in 29/897 patients (3.2%) and was mutually exclusive of known classifying genetic lesions, suggesting that it characterized a distinct leukemia entity. ERG(del) was associated with higher age (median 7.0 vs. 4.0 years, P=0.004), aberrant CD2 expression (43.5% vs. 3.7%, P<0.001) and frequent IKZF1 Delta4-7 deletions (37.9% vs. 5.3%, P<0.001).

Our goals were to determine the occurrence and impact of these infections in children treated for AML and to understand the factors that increase the risk of VGS infections and viridans streptococcal shock syndrome (VSSS) in this population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included children </=18 years of age with de novo AML treated at 15 Canadian centers. We evaluated factors related to VGS infection and VSSS. RESULTS: Among 341 children with AML, VGS occurred in 78 (22.9%) children over the entire course of therapy and 16 had recurrent episodes. VGS infection occurred in 97 of 1277 courses of chemotherapy (7.6%). VSSS occurred in 19.6% of these episodes and included 11 patients who required intensive care services with 2 VGS infections resulting in death. In multiple regression analysis, factors independently related to VGS included treatment on a Medical Research Council-based protocol (odds ratio (OR) 2.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-5.39; P = 0.001), cytarabine dose per gram/m(2) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; P = 0.002) and prolonged neutropenia (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 0.97-2.56; P = 0.06).

Th22 cells are recently-identified CD4(+) T cells that implicated in the pathogenesis of many hematological diseases, such as AML. However, the role of Th22 cells in the pathophysiology of T-ALL remains unclear. We examined the Th22, Th17 and Th1 cell frequencies in peripheral blood of T-ALL patients. METHODS: We studied 24 newly-diagnosed (ND), 17 morphologic complete remission (CR) T-ALL patients and 30 healthy controls. Th subsets were examined by flow cytometry. Plasma IL-22 and IL-17 concentrations were measured by ELISA. Transcription factor RORC, T-bet and AHR mRNA expressions were examined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Th22, Th17 frequencies, plasma IL-22 concentration and AHR expression were significantly increased in ND or CR T-ALL patients compared with controls. Moreover, Th22 showed positive correlation with Th17 or Th1 cells in T-ALL patients. However, a significant decrease of IL-17 concentration, Th1 frequency and T-bet expression was found in ND or CR ALL patients compared with controls. Furthermore, Th17 cells showed positive correlation but Th1 cells showed negative correlation with white blood cell counts. CONCLUSION: The profile of Th subsets was distinct for T-ALL patients and showed some correlations with clinical index, which suggest that these Th subsets may be implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and be reasonable targets for therapeutic intervention.",['(c) 2013.

Previous studies have reported context-dependent regulation of E2A-dependent transcription. For example, whereas the E2A portion of the E2A-Pbx1 leukemia fusion protein mediates robust transcriptional activation in t(1;19) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the transcriptional activity of wild-type E2A is silenced by high levels of corepressors, such as the AML1-ETO fusion protein in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia and ETO-2 in hematopoietic cells. Here, we show that, unlike the HEB E-protein, the activation domain 1 (AD1) of E2A has specifically reduced corepressor interaction due to E2A-specific amino acid changes in the p300/CBP and ETO target motif. Replacing E2A-AD1 with HEB-AD1 abolished the ability of E2A-Pbx1 to activate target genes and to induce cell transformation. On the other hand, the weak E2A-AD1-corepressor interaction imposes a critical importance on another ETO-interacting domain, downstream ETO-interacting sequence (DES), for corepressor-mediated repression. Deletion of DES abrogates silencing of E2A activity by AML1-ETO in t(8;21) leukemia cells or by ETO-2 in normal hematopoietic cells. Our results reveal an E2A-specific mechanism important for its context-dependent activation and repression function, and provide the first evidence for the differential involvement of E2A-corepressor interactions in distinct leukemogenic pathways.",,"['Gow, Chien-Hung', 'Guo, Chun', 'Wang, David', 'Hu, Qiande', 'Zhang, Jinsong']","['Gow CH', 'Guo C', 'Wang D', 'Hu Q', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130924,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt855 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt855 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(1):137-52. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt855.

Here we observed that on HL-60 leukemia cells, sonoporation may induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress on a time-lapse basis and, in turn, signal the mitochondria to commit a cell toward apoptosis. Our observations were derived from in vitro ultrasound exposure experiments performed on HL-60 cells in the presence of lipid-shelled microbubbles (1:1 cell-to-bubble ratio; 1-MHz frequency; 0.45-MPa in situ peak negative pressure; 100-cycle pulse length; 1-kHz pulse repetition frequency; 60-s exposure period). Using flow cytometry, we found that sonoporated cells exhibited a progressive loss of functional ER mass over a 6-h period. Also, post-exposure Western blot assays (between 0 and 24 h) revealed various indications of post-sonoporation ER stress: (i) upregulation of ER-resident enzymes responsible for catalyzing protein folding; (ii) activation of trans-ER-membrane stress sensors; (iii) increased expression of ER-induced regulatory proteins that mediate pro-apoptotic signals to the mitochondria. These results corresponded to flow cytometry observations that depicted a progressive depolarization of a sonoporated cell's mitochondrial outer membrane potential.

In the first screening tests, serological false negative and positive samples have been reduced thanks to advances in assay techniques that apply new emission agents and sensors. On the other hand, western blot (WB) remains problematic. For example, WB analysis yields many samples equivalent to antibody positive ones. To reduce the need for WB, an alternative testing strategy is required to detect HTLV-1 infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the HTLV-1 provirus has recently been recommended for a final diagnosis of infection. However, although PCR is thought to be one element, the validation of detection performance for HTLV-1 infection between serological and molecular testing is not always clear. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and test the validity of an improved methodology for serological detection of HTLV-infection, as well as that of PCR. In conclusion, the high values of kappa-statistics are expected to deliver high quality in chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (or chemiluminescent immunoassay), while the problems with WB assays remain to be elucidated.

Although e-cigarettes have been proposed as long-term substitutes for traditional smoking or as a tool for smoking cessation, very scarce data are available on their efficacy and safety.We describe the protocol of a 5-year multicentric prospective study aimed to evaluate short- and long-term adherence to e-cigarette smoking and the efficacy of e-cigarettes in reducing and/or quitting traditional cigarette smoking. The study will also compare the health effects of electronic vs traditional vs mixed cigarette smoking. METHODS/DESIGN: From June to December 2013, we will enroll adult smokers of: (EC) e-cigarettes (self-reported inhaling >/= 50 puffs per week since >/= 6 months); (TC) traditional cigarettes (>/= 1 per day since >/= 6 m); (Mixed) both electronic and traditional cigarettes (>/= 1 per day since >/= 6 m). Eligible subjects will be requested participation through newspaper advertisements and direct contact at the shops. Each subject will have to compile a structured questionnaire at enrolment and after 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months. The level of carbon monoxide in expired after breath will be evaluated in all subjects declaring no traditional cigarette smoking in any follow-up phase, using portable carbon monoxide analyzers. The primary outcomes are traditional smoking cessation rates and number of smoked cigarettes. Secondary outcomes include adherence to e-cigarettes, self-reported adverse events, quality of life, and time to hospital admission for one among cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cancer of the lung, esophagus, larynx, oral cavity, bladder, pancreas, kidney, stomach, cervix, and myeloid leukemia. Admissions will be checked using official discharge data of the Abruzzo Region. A minimum of 500 subjects in each group will be enrolled, for a total of 1500 participants. Cox proportional hazards analysis will be used to calculate adjusted relative hazards of smoking cessation by each variable. DISCUSSION: Data on long-term efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes will be of utmost importance to form the basis for guidelines and regulatory decisions on e-cigarettes.

However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the role of this group of genes in different cancer types. RESULTS: We have analyzed 4,623 tumor samples from thirteen anatomical sites to determine which chromatin regulatory factors are candidate drivers in these different sites. We identify 34 chromatin regulatory factors that are likely drivers in tumors from at least one site, all with relatively low mutational frequency. We also analyze the relative importance of mutations in this group of genes for the development of tumorigenesis in each site, and indifferent tumor types from the same site. CONCLUSIONS: We find that, although tumors from all thirteen sites show mutations in likely driver chromatin regulatory factors, these are more prevalent in tumors arising from certain tissues. With the exception of hematopoietic, liver and kidney tumors, as a median, the mutated factors are less than one fifth of all mutated drivers across all sites analyzed. We also show that mutations in two of these genes, MLL and EP300, correlate with broad expression changes across cancer cell lines, thus presenting at least one mechanism through which these mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis in cells of the corresponding tissues.",,"['Gonzalez-Perez, Abel', 'Jene-Sanz, Alba', 'Lopez-Bigas, Nuria']","['Gonzalez-Perez A', 'Jene-Sanz A', 'Lopez-Bigas N']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mutation Rate', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Interaction Mapping']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2013/09/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['gb-2013-14-9-r106 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2013-14-9-r106 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Biol. 2013;14(9):r106. doi: 10.1186/gb-2013-14-9-r106.,PMC4054018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between DNA methylation, cytogenetic background, drug resistance and relapse in ALL is poorly understood. RESULTS: We surveyed the DNA methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites in samples from 764 children at diagnosis of ALL and from 27 children at relapse. This survey uncovered four characteristic methylation signatures. First, compared with control blood cells, the methylomes of ALL cells shared 9,406 predominantly hypermethylated CpG sites, independent of cytogenetic background. Second, each cytogenetic subtype of ALL displayed a unique set of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites. The CpG sites that constituted these two signatures differed in their functional genomic enrichment to regions with marks of active or repressed chromatin. Third, we identified subtype-specific differential methylation in promoter and enhancer regions that were strongly correlated with gene expression. Fourth, a set of 6,612 CpG sites was predominantly hypermethylated in ALL cells at relapse, compared with matched samples at diagnosis. Analysis of relapse-free survival identified CpG sites with subtype-specific differential methylation that divided the patients into different risk groups, depending on their methylation status.

To verify that our RNAi approach produced the expected Pdp1 knockdown, the abdominal fat tissues sections were stained with PDP1 antibodies. PDP1 protein immunostaining was absent in flies injected with dsRNA targeting a sequence common to all known Pdp1 isoforms. Subsequent experiments revealed that lipid staining is reduced in flies injected with dsRNA against Pdp1 gamma (fat body specific) and not against Pdp1 epsilon (predominantly involved in circadian mechanisms). Drosophila PDP1 gamma protein shows a high homology to mammalian thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF), albumin D site-binding protein (DBP), and hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) transcription factors. In an in vitro model of drug- (olanzapine-) induced adiposity in mouse 3T3-L1 cells, the mRNA content of HLF but not TEF and DBP was increased by the drug treatment. A knockdown of the HLF mRNA by transfecting the cultures with HLF dsRNA significantly reduced their lipid content.

BKV infects humans at an early age. Initial infections with BKV are mainly asymptomatic and usually remain latent in the brain, peripheral blood, kidneys, and urothelium. Following the primary infection, viruses persist indefinitely as 'latent' infections of the kidney and urinary system because the virus is urotheliotropic. Reactivation of the virus infections occurs in individuals with severe immunosuppression states such as kidney and stem cell transplantation and rarely in pregnancy. In this line, BKV has been implicated as a common cause of late-onset haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation. In contrast, reports of BKV-associated diseases in nontransplant paediatric patients are almost exclusively in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of adult T cell leukemia and multiple neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases while HTLV-2 disease association remains elusive, with few infected individuals displaying neurodegenerative diseases similar to HTLV-1. The HTLV group of oncoretroviruses has a genome that encodes structural and enzymatic proteins Gag, Pro, and Env, regulatory proteins Tax and Rex, and several accessory proteins from the pX region. Of these proteins, HTLV-1 p30 and HTLV-2 p28 are encoded by the open reading frame II of the pX region. Like most other accessory proteins, p30 and p28 are dispensable for in vitro viral replication and transformation but are required for efficient viral replication and persistence in vivo. Both p30 and p28 regulate viral gene expression at the post-transcriptional level whereas p30 can also function at the transcriptional level. Recently, several reports have implicated p30 and p28 in multiple cellular processes, which provide novel insight into HTLV spread and survival and ultimately pathogenesis.

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the detailed molecular mechanism related to Mith-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Mith decreased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in both cell lines overexpressing phospho-mTOR compared to RWPE-1 human normal prostate epithelial cells. Mith significantly induced truncated Bid (tBid) and siRNA-mediated knock-down of Mcl-1 increased tBid protein levels. Moreover, Mith also inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR on serine 2448 and Mcl-1, and increased tBid protein in prostate tumors in athymic nude mice bearing DU145 cells as xenografts.

The identification of such candidates is complicated by the involvement of multiple miRNAs and mRNAs as well as unknown disease topology of the miRNAs. Here, we investigated if disease-associated miRNAs regulate modules of disease-associated mRNAs, if those miRNAs act complementarily or synergistically, and if single or combinations of miRNAs can be targeted to alter module functions. We first analyzed publicly available miRNA and mRNA expression data for five different diseases. Integrated target prediction and network-based analysis showed that the miRNAs regulated modules of disease-relevant genes. Most of the miRNAs acted complementarily to regulate multiple mRNAs. To functionally test these findings, we repeated the analysis using our own miRNA and mRNA expression data from CD4+ T cells from patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. This is a good model of complex diseases because of its well-defined phenotype and pathogenesis. Combined computational and functional studies confirmed that miRNAs mainly acted complementarily and that a combination of two complementary miRNAs, miR-223 and miR-139-3p, could be targeted to alter disease-relevant module functions, namely, the release of type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) cytokines.

We investigated whether measuring chemotherapy sensitivity by multiparameter flow cytometric minimal residual disease (MFC-MRD) detection has prognostic value in patients older than age 60 years or is simply a surrogate for known age-related risk factors. PATIENT AND METHODS: Eight hundred ninety-two unselected patients treated intensively in the United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute AML16 Trial were assessed prospectively for MFC-MRD during treatment. Eight hundred thirty-three patients had leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) identified by pretreatment screening. Four hundred twenty-seven patients entered complete remission (CR) after one or two courses (designated C1 and C2, respectively) and were MFC-MRD assessable by LAIP detection in CR bone marrow for at least one of these time points. MRD positivity was defined as residual disease detectable by LAIP. RESULTS: MFC-MRD negativity, which was achieved in 51% of patients after C1 (n = 286) and 64% of patients after C2 (n = 279), conferred significantly better 3-year survival from CR (C1: 42% v 26% in MRD-positive patients, P < .001; C2: 38% v 18%, respectively; P < .001) and reduced relapse (C1: 71% v 83% in MRD-positive patients, P < .001; C2: 79% v 91%, respectively; P < .001), with higher risk of early relapse in MRD-positive patients (median time to relapse, 8.5 v 17.1 months, respectively). In multivariable analysis, MRD status at the post-C1 time point independently predicted survival, identifying a subgroup of intermediate-risk patients with particularly poor outcome. However, survival benefit from gemtuzumab ozogamicin was not associated with MFC-MRD chemotherapy sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Early assessment of treatment response using flow cytometry provides powerful independent prognostic information in older adults with AML, lending support to the incorporation of MRD detection to refine risk stratification and inform clinical trial design in this challenging group of patients.",,"['Freeman, Sylvie D', 'Virgo, Paul', 'Couzens, Steve', 'Grimwade, David', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Burnett, Alan K']","['Freeman SD', 'Virgo P', 'Couzens S', 'Grimwade D', 'Russell N', 'Hills RK', 'Burnett AK']","[""Sylvie D.

Residual treatment-surviving leukemia is considered responsible for the outgrowth of AML. In many retrospective studies, detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) has been shown to enable identification of these poor-outcome patients by showing its independent prognostic impact. Most studies focus on molecular markers or analyze data in retrospect. This study establishes the value of immunophenotypically assessed MRD in the context of a multicenter clinical trial in adult AML with sample collection and analysis performed in a few specialized centers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In adults (younger than age 60 years) with AML enrolled onto the Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group/Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research Acute Myeloid Leukemia 42A study, MRD was evaluated in bone marrow samples in CR (164 after induction cycle 1, 183 after cycle 2, 124 after consolidation therapy). RESULTS: After all courses of therapy, low MRD values distinguished patients with relatively favorable outcome from those with high relapse rate and adverse relapse-free and overall survival. In the whole patient group and in the subgroup with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, MRD was an independent prognostic factor. Multivariate analysis after cycle 2, when decisions about consolidation treatment have to be made, confirmed that high MRD values (> 0.1% of WBC) were associated with a higher risk of relapse after adjustment for consolidation treatment time-dependent covariate risk score and early or later CR.

The aim of this study was to address clonal heterogeneity in AML based on metaphase cytogenetics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis included all patients enrolled onto two consecutive, prospective, randomized multicenter trials of the Study Alliance Leukemia. Patients were newly diagnosed with non-M3 AML and were fit for intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Cytogenetic subclones were detected in 418 (15.8%) of 2,639 patients from the whole study population and in 418 (32.8%) of 1,274 patients with aberrant karyotypes. Among those, 252 karyotypes (60.3%) displayed a defined number of distinct subclones, and 166 (39.7%) were classified as composite karyotypes. Subclone formation was particularly frequent in the cytogenetically adverse group, with subclone formation in 69.0%, 67.1%, and 64.8% of patients with complex aberrant, monosomal, and abnl(17p) karyotypes (P < .001 each). Two-subclone patterns typically followed a mother-daughter evolution, whereas for >/= three subclones, a branched pattern prevailed. In non-core binding factor AML, subclone formation was associated with inferior event-free and overall survival and was confirmed as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis showed that subclone formation adds prognostic information particularly in the cytogenetic adverse-risk group. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation improved the prognosis of patients with subclone karyotypes as shown in landmark analyses. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic subclones are frequent in AML and permit tracing of clonal evolution and architecture. They bear prognostic significance with clonal heterogeneity as an independent adverse prognostic marker in cytogenetically adverse-risk AML.",,"['Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Heilig, Christoph E', 'Kunz, Christina', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Janssen, Johannes W G', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Benner, Axel', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Bochtler T', 'Stolzel F', 'Heilig CE', 'Kunz C', 'Mohr B', 'Jauch A', 'Janssen JW', 'Kramer M', 'Benner A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ho AD', 'Ehninger G', 'Schaich M', 'Kramer A']","['Tilmann Bochtler, Christoph E.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1, 2008, and March 1, 2011, 212 newly diagnosed patients with AML received treatment at our center. Ninety-five patients age less than 75 years with intermediate- or high-risk AML achieved a complete remission, and 21 patients achieved a morphologic remission with incomplete blood count recovery. RESULTS: Seventy-eight (67%; 95% CI, 58% to 76%) of 116 patients received HCT at a median of 2.8 months (range, 0.5 to 19 months) from their CR1 date. The median age was 57 years in both the HCT patient group (range, 18 to 75 years) and the non-HCT patient group (range, 24 to 70 years; P = .514). Between the HCT patients and the non-HCT patients, the mean Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1.1 compared with 1.5, respectively (P = .005), and the average HCT comorbidity score within 60 days of CR1 was 1.7 and 2.1, respectively (P = .68). Twenty-nine (76%) of 38 non-HCT patients were HLA typed, and matched donors were found for 13 of these 29 patients (34% of all non-HCT patients). The most common causes for patients not receiving transplantation in CR1 were early relapse (within 6 months) in 12 patients (32%), poor performance status in eight patients (21%), and physician decision in five patients (13%). CONCLUSION: HCT can be performed in CR1 in the majority of patients with AML for whom it is currently recommended. The main barriers to HCT were early relapse and poor performance status, highlighting the need for improved therapies for patients with AML of all ages.",,"['Mawad, Raya', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Sandhu, Vicky', 'Lionberger, Jack', 'Scott, Bart', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', ""O'Donnell, Paul"", 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Petersdorf, Stephen', 'Dorcy, Kathleen Shannon', 'Hendrie, Paul', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Pagel, John M']","['Mawad R', 'Gooley TA', 'Sandhu V', 'Lionberger J', 'Scott B', 'Sandmaier BM', ""O'Donnell P"", 'Becker PS', 'Petersdorf S', 'Dorcy KS', 'Hendrie P', 'Sorror ML', 'Walter RB', 'Deeg HJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey EH', 'Pagel JM']","[""Raya Mawad, Ted A.

Zoledronate (ZOL), an inhibitor of osteoclastic activity, is known to stimulate peripheral blood-derived gammadeltaT cells and sensitize tumors to gammadeltaT cell-mediated killing. To investigate the feasibility of gammadeltaT cell-based immunotherapy for patients with GBM, we focused on the killing of GBM cell lines by gammadeltaT cells and the molecular mechanisms involved in these cell-cell interactions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were expanded in ZOL and interleukin (IL)-2 for 14 days, and gammadeltaT cells were enriched in the expanded cells by the immunomagnetic depletion of alphabetaT cells. Gliomas are resistant to NK cells but susceptible to lymphokine-activated killer cells and some cytotoxic T lymphocytes. When the gammadeltaT cell-mediated killing of three GBM cell lines (U87MG, U138MG and A172 cells) and an NK-sensitive leukemia cell line (K562 cells) were tested, 32% U87MG, 15% U138MG, 1% A172, and 50% K562 cells were killed at an effector:target ratio of 5:1. The gammadeltaT cell-mediated killing of all three GBM cell lines was significantly enhanced by ZOL and this ZOL-enhanced killing was blocked by an anti-T cell receptor (TcR) antibody. These results indicated that TcR gammadelta is crucial for the recognition of ZOL-treated GBM cells by gammadeltaT cells. Since the low level killing of GBM cells by the gammadeltaT cells was enhanced by ZOL, gammadeltaT cell-targeting therapy in combination with ZOL treatment could be effective for patients with GBM.",,"['Nakazawa, Tsutomu', 'Nakamura, Mitsutoshi', 'Park, Young Soo', 'Motoyama, Yasushi', 'Hironaka, Yasuo', 'Nishimura, Fumihiko', 'Nakagawa, Ichiro', 'Yamada, Shuichi', 'Matsuda, Ryosuke', 'Tamura, Kentaro', 'Sugimoto, Tadashi', 'Takeshima, Yasuhiro', 'Marutani, Akiko', 'Tsujimura, Takahiro', 'Ouji, Noriko', 'Ouji, Yukiteru', 'Yoshikawa, Masahide', 'Nakase, Hiroyuki']","['Nakazawa T', 'Nakamura M', 'Park YS', 'Motoyama Y', 'Hironaka Y', 'Nishimura F', 'Nakagawa I', 'Yamada S', 'Matsuda R', 'Tamura K', 'Sugimoto T', 'Takeshima Y', 'Marutani A', 'Tsujimura T', 'Ouji N', 'Ouji Y', 'Yoshikawa M', 'Nakase H']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840, Shijocho, Kashihara, Nara, 634-8522, Japan, nakazawa@naramed-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130924,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diphosphonates/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Glioblastoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Zoledronic Acid']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2013/09/25 06:00'],"['2013/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-013-1258-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2014 Jan;116(1):31-9. doi: 10.1007/s11060-013-1258-4.

Although in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for specific mutations have been suggested to guide TKI choice in the clinic, the quantitative relationship between IC(50) and clinical response has never been demonstrated. We used Hill's equation for in vitro response of Ba/F3 cells transduced with various BCR-ABL mutants to determine IC(50) and the slope of the dose-response curve. We found that slope variability between mutants tracked with in vitro TKI resistance, provides particular additional interpretive value in cases where in vitro IC(50) and clinical response are disparate. Moreover, unlike IC(50) alone, higher inhibitory potential at peak concentration (IPP), which integrates IC(50), slope, and peak concentration (Cmax), correlated with improved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates in CML patients treated with dasatinib.

This retrospective study used multiparametric flow cytometric analysis aimed at immunophenotypic profiling of composite mature B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms in a cohort of 413 subsequent patients with de novo leukemic B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders diagnosed in our institution during a 30-month period. Biclonality was found in 16 (3.9 %) patients. The vast majority (88 %) of the cases had one of the clones phenotypically corresponding to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Only when composite cases were categorized by phenotype of the non-CLL/SLL malignant population did we find a statistically significant (P = 0.001) higher frequency of biclonality among cases with hairy cell leukemia (22 %). Biclonal cases had the overall B-cell membrane kappa to lambda ratio within the normal range (median, 1.9; reference interval 0.5-4.0), making recognition of malignancy somewhat challenging. Our analysis strategy was therefore based on the detection of aberrant B-cell phenotypes, with subsequent confirmation of the monoclonal nature of neoplastic clones with regards to light chain restriction analysis. Discrimination of the coexisting clones in biclonal cases was possible on the basis of the expression of other antigen(s) (63 %), light scatter properties (44 %), different surface light chain restriction (69 %) and/or pattern of expression (44 %). The most informative cell surface antigens proved to be CD22, CD20, surface IgM, and CD23.

This study evaluated genetic variants in genes encoding microRNA (miRNA) binding sites for informing of time to prostate cancer diagnosis among ethnically diverse, high-risk men undergoing prostate cancer screening. METHODS: The Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program (PRAP) is a longitudinal screening program for high-risk men. The eligibility includes men aged between 35 and 69 years with a family history of prostate cancer or African descent. Participants with >/=1 follow-up visit were included in the analyses (n=477). Genetic variants in genes encoding miRNA binding sites (ALOX15 (arachidonate 15-lipooxygenase), IL-16, IL-18 and RAF1 (v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1)) previously implicated in prostate cancer development were evaluated. Genotyping methods included Taqman SNP Genotyping Assay or pyrosequencing. Cox models were used to assess time to prostate cancer diagnosis by risk genotype. RESULTS: Among 256 African Americans with >/=one follow-up visit, the TT genotype at rs1131445 in IL-16 was significantly associated with earlier time to prostate cancer diagnosis vs the CC/CT genotypes (P=0.013), with a suggestive association after correction for false discovery (P=0.065). Hazard ratio after controlling for age and PSA for TT vs CC/CT among African Americans was 3.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.26-7.12). No association with time to diagnosis was detected among Caucasians by IL-16 genotype. No association with time to prostate cancer diagnosis was found for the other miRNA target genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in IL-16 encoding miRNA target site may be informative of time to prostate cancer diagnosis among African-American men enrolled in prostate cancer risk assessment, which may inform individualized prostate cancer screening strategies in the future.",,"['Hughes, L', 'Ruth, K', 'Rebbeck, T R', 'Giri, V N']","['Hughes L', 'Ruth K', 'Rebbeck TR', 'Giri VN']","['Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130924,England,Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,9815755,"['0 (Interleukin-16)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Binding Sites', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-16/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', '*RNA Interference', 'Risk Factors']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2014/06/21 06:00,['2013/09/25 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['pcan201336 [pii]', '10.1038/pcan.2013.36 [doi]']",ppublish,Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 2013 Dec;16(4):308-14. doi: 10.1038/pcan.2013.36.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied interphase - fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on total 238 cases of B-CLL. RESULTS: Our study disclosed 69% of patients with genetic aberrations such as 13q deletion (63%), trisomy 12 (28%), 11q deletion (18%), 6q21 deletion (11%) with comparatively higher frequency of TP53 deletion (22%). Deletion 13q displayed as a most frequent sole abnormality. In group with coexistence of >/=2 aberrations, 13q deletion was a major clone indicating del(13q) as a primary event followed by 11q deletion, TP53 deletion, trisomy 12, 6q deletion as secondary progressive events. In comparison with del(13q), trisomy 12, group with coexistence of >/=2 aberrations associated with poor risk factors such as hyperleukocytosis, advanced stage, and multiple nodes involvement. In a separate study of 116 patients, analysis of IgH abnormalities revealed either partial deletion (24%) or translocation (5%) and were associated with del(13q), trisomy 12, TP53 and ATM deletion. Two of 7 cases had t(14;18), one case had t(8;14), and four cases had other variant IgH translocation t(?;14). CONCLUSION: Detail characterization and clinical impact are necessary to ensure that IgH translocation positive CLL is a distinct pathological entity.

In an increasing number of B-cell malignancies, BCR signaling is implicated as a pivotal pathway in tumorigenesis. Mechanisms of BCR activation are quite diverse and range from chronic antigenic drive by microbial or viral antigens to autostimulation of B-cells by self-antigens to activating mutations in intracellular components of the BCR pathway. Hepatitis C virus infection can lead to the development of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, while Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. In some of these cases, successful treatment of the infection removes the inciting antigen and results in resolution of the lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been recognized for decades as a malignancy of auto-reactive B-cells and its clinical course is in part determined by the differential response of the malignant cells to BCR activation. In a number of B-cell malignancies, activating mutations in signal transduction components of the BCR pathway have been identified; prominent examples are activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) that carry mutations in CD79B and CARD11 and display chronic active BCR signaling resulting in constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Despite considerable heterogeneity in biology and clinical course, many mature B-cell malignancies are highly sensitive to kinase inhibitors that disrupt BCR signaling. Thus, targeted therapy through inhibition of BCR signaling is emerging as a new treatment paradigm for many B-cell malignancies. Here, we review the role of the BCR in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies and summarize clinical results of the emerging class of kinase inhibitors that target this pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

METHODS: To investigate the prevalence and predictors of CAM use in this group of patients, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was offered to all carers of patients either on or off treatment for malignancy at a single pediatric cancer center over an 8-week period. RESULTS: Of a total of 220 questionnaires distributed, 98 (43%) were returned. Six were excluded because of inadequate data. A total of 58% of children were male and the mean age was 9 years. The most common cancer diagnosis was leukemia (45%). Fifty-two respondents (57%) said their child had used or was using CAM, and 55% of whom had started since their cancer diagnosis. The most common types of CAM used were vitamins and minerals (18%), reflexology (11%), dietary supplements (11%), faith healers (9%), and energy therapies (9%). The most common reason for CAM use was to improve physical well-being (31%). A total of 65% of CAM users had not told their doctor that they were doing so. Of the 52 CAM users, 30 (58%) were using oral CAM medication. A total of 86% of CAM users reported benefit from the treatment, and no respondent reported side effects.There was no significant relationship between sex, tumor type, age, income, previous treatment, and CAM use. Where parents had a higher level of education, children were more likely to use CAM (P=0.035.) There was a statistically significant relationship between respondents rating of conventional therapy and CAM use (P=0.007). Interestingly, parents who were satisfied with conventional therapy were more likely to use CAM. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of CAM use demonstrated in this study and particularly the high use of CAM medication therapies underlines the importance of physicians asking routinely about CAM use in this population.",,"[""O'Connor, Niamh"", 'Graham, Donna', ""O'Meara, Anne"", 'Devins, Mary', 'Jennings, Valerie', ""O'Leary, Denise"", ""O'Reilly, Maeve""]","[""O'Connor N"", 'Graham D', ""O'Meara A"", 'Devins M', 'Jennings V', ""O'Leary D"", ""O'Reilly M""]","[""The Departments of Palliative Medicine and Oncology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Complementary Therapies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ireland', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2013/09/26 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/25 06:00'],"['2013/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31829f408a [doi]', '00043426-201310000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Oct;35(7):537-42. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31829f408a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In clinical practice, determination of nutritional status can be accomplished with measurement of body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, DXA is seldom available in low-income countries where most children with cancer live. This study sought to provide predictive equations for lean body mass and fat mass, measured by DXA, on the basis of simple arm anthropometry providing measures of mid-upper arm circumference and triceps skin-fold thickness in a population (N=99) of children diagnosed with cancer. Such equations were derived successfully with the inclusion of absolute body weight, the body weight Z-score, and the predicted whole-body bone mineral content on the basis of age and sex. Attempted validation in a small sample (N=7) of children who completed therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed disparities reflective of the prevalence of obesity in such survivors.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of 2 different strengths of the imatinib formulation containing 100 mg (reference) and 400 mg (test) to satisfy the regulatory requirement for marketing. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, comparative crossover study with a 14-day washout period was conducted in 30 healthy male volunteers. Plasma samples for the drug analysis were collected up to 72 hours after drug treatment. Participants received either the reference (4 tablets of 100-mg imatinib) or the test (1 tablet of 400-mg imatinib) formulation during the first period and the alternative formulation during the second period. The safety profiles and tolerability of the 2 formulations were also assessed based on physical examinations, laboratory tests, a 12-lead ECG, and vital signs. RESULTS: Thirty participants were initially enrolled; their mean (SD) age, height, weight, and body mass index were 24.9 (2.0) years (range, 23-30 years), 174 (5) cm (range, 164-185 cm), 69.9 (2.0) kg (range, 54.1-87.4 kg), and 23.0 (2.0) kg/m(2) (range, 18.5-26.9 kg/m(2)); 28 healthy participants completed both treatment periods. Two subjects did not complete the study because they withdrew consent for personal reasons. The observed mean (SD) Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-infinity values for the reference formulation were 1792 (357) ng/mL, 28,485 (6274) ng . h/mL, and 29,079 (6371) ng . h/mL, respectively. Corresponding values for the test formulation were 1710 (312) ng/mL, 27,222 (4624) ng . h/mL , and 27,872 (4751) ng . h/mL. The geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) between the 2 formulations at the 400-mg dose of imatinib were 0.9579 (0.9054-1.0136) for Cmax, 0.9652 (0.9174-1.0155) for AUC0-last, and 0.9679 (0.9203-1.0179) for AUC0-infinity, respectively. During the study period, 6 adverse events (3 for the reference and 3 for the test formulation) were reported; all were transient, mild, and resolved completely during the treatment period. There were 4 cases of nausea and 1 case each of dizziness and oropharyngeal pain. Four adverse events were considered related to the study drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that despite the different strengths of the 2 imatinib formations, the test and reference formulations both met the regulatory criteria for pharmacokinetic equivalence at a dose of imatinib 400 mg in these healthy Korean male subjects. Both imatinib formulations seemed to be generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01270984.","['(c) 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: The PubMed database was used to search studies up to May 5, 2013, and the lists of references of retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional relevant studies. Studies were included if they reported the odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of childhood AL, including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with respect to maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy. RESULTS: Compared with non/lowest drinkers, the combined odds ratio regarding the relationship of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and childhood AL was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.04-1.43) for ever drinkers, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00-1.34) for low to moderate-level drinkers, and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) for high-level drinkers. When analysis was conducted by subtypes of childhood AL, maternal coffee consumption (high-level drinkers vs non/lowest drinkers) was statistically significantly associated with childhood ALL (1.65; 95% CI, 1.28-2.12) and childhood AML (1.58; 95% CI, 1.20-2.08). We observed the linear dose-response relationship of coffee consumption and childhood AL (P for nonlinearity = .68), including childhood ALL and childhood AML; with increased coffee consumption, the risk of childhood AL increased. CONCLUSION: The findings of the metaanalysis suggest that maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of childhood AL. Because of limited studies, further prospective studies are urgently needed to explore the adverse effect of coffee consumption on childhood AL.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Mosby, Inc.

The target gene vector (containing CD and TK) and envelope (containing GFP and anti-MUC1) and packaging plasmids were cotransfected into 293T cells to produce the recombinant lentivirus. Suicide genes in virus-infected leukemia cells (U937, Jurkat, and K562) were detected by western blot. The cytotoxicity and bystander effect in vitro and the therapeutic effect in vivo were detected after treatment with the prodrugs. The results revealed that combined treatment with prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and ganciclovir (GCV) inhibited leukemia cell growth and caused significant bystander effect than treatment with either prodrug alone. TK/GCV treatment alone induced degeneration and cell death while the effect of CD/5-FC alone mainly caused vacuolar degeneration and necrosis. The addictive effects of combinatorial use of GCV and 5-FC mainly induced swelling of the mitochondria followed by necrosis of the leukemia cells. In vivo experiments revealed that both single and combinatorial prodrug treatments could prolong the survival time of leukemic mice. In summary, anti-MUC1 antibody directed lentiviral vector successfully transduced dual suicide genes and exerted targeted cytotoxicity against MUC1 positive leukemia cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the outcomes of patients receiving imatinib outside of a clinical trial (off protocol) or in a clinical trial (on protocol) for CML-CP. RESULTS: We identified 65 patients treated with imatinib off protocol and 71 patients treated on protocol with standard-dose imatinib. The overall complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate was 83% for patients treated on and off protocol. CCyR rates 12 months after initiation of imatinib were not statistically different (61% vs. 66%, respectively; P = .15). Patients treated off protocol had similar rates of overall major molecular response (72% vs. 73%) compared with the patients treated on protocol. The 5-year event-free survival rates were 84% and 86% for off and on protocol patients, respectively. There was also no significant difference in 5-year transformation free survival (94% vs. 96%) and overall survival (96% vs. 90%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed clonogenic assays on mononuclear bone marrow cells from 14 patients. Of the 10 assessable samples, 6 were from patients in CMR and 4 from patients in complete cytogenetic remission but had detectable MRD using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis (positive controls). At least 10 colonies per sample were microaspirated and individual colonies were subjected to PCR analysis. RESULTS: Of the 6 patients in CMR, 5 harbored breakpoint cluster region abelson (BCR-ABL1) negative colonies but in 1 sample, 1 of the 10 colonies analyzed was positive for BCR-ABL1. Of the 4 patients with evidence of MRD in peripheral blood, 2 had negative and 2 had positive BCR-ABL1 colonies. CONCLUSION: MRD is still detectable using clonogenic assays in some patients with CML after achieving CMR using TKI therapy, which is likely responsible for relapse on TKI discontinuation. Because of the large number of single colonies that need to be analyzed, the use of clonogenic assays in clinical practice to determine the feasibility of TKI discontinuation is not recommended.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

FINDINGS: From a literature survey it is concluded that there is statistically significant published evidence consistent with the involvement of airborne electroactive agents in the powerline proximity modulation of some cytokine activity. Attention is drawn to overhead line fault associated corona discharge action as a source of potentially bioactive agents deserving careful study in view of the widespread close residential proximity to overhead power distribution lines in many countries. Particular attention is given to the role of electricity access associated faults as a possible explanation for the high childhood leukaemia rates in certain districts of Mexico City. CONCLUSIONS: Despite more than 30 years research worldwide there is no generally accepted biological mechanism to explain the adverse health impact of overhead powerline residential proximity.

While the activity of these proteins is tightly regulated under physiological conditions, they can become constitutively activated in a broad range of human cancers. This inappropriate STAT activation leads to enhanced transcription of genes that can directly lead to the malignant phenotype. Since STATs are largely dispensable for normal cell function, this has raised the possibility that STATs might be key targets for cancer therapy. Although a number of structure-based strategies have been used to develop STAT inhibitors, an alternate approach is to use cell-based assays that make use of the transcriptional function of STATs. Employing these systems, one can screen large chemical libraries to identify compounds that specifically block the function of a given STAT. This approach can lead to the identification of compounds that inhibit STATs by a variety of mechanisms, and can suggest novel targets for therapy. This type of functional screening strategy has already identified a drug that potently inhibits STAT3, and which is now being evaluated in a clinical trial for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,"['Walker, Sarah R', 'Frank, David A']","['Walker SR', 'Frank DA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and Department of Medicine; Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School; Boston, MA USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,JAKSTAT,JAK-STAT,101591376,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cancer therapy', 'drug discovery', 'phosphorylation', 'transcription factors']",2013/09/24 06:00,2013/09/24 06:01,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/jkst.22662 [doi]', '2012JAKS0060R [pii]']",ppublish,JAKSTAT. 2012 Oct 1;1(4):292-9. doi: 10.4161/jkst.22662.,PMC3670287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JAK-STAT3 activating cytokines have exhibited cardioprotective roles in the heart. The cardiac-specific deletion of SOCS3 enhances the activation of cardioprotective signaling pathways, inhibits myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis and results in the inhibition of left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI).

These mechanisms enhance the extent and the duration of, e.g., STAT3 activation and have profound consequences on the phenotypes of the affected cells. The fine tuning of STAT3 signaling is required to maintain its physiological functions and its deregulation is associated with diverse pathological states. Deregulation can be exerted by the gain of function of components mediating the activation of STAT3 or the loss of function of molecules involved in the deactivation steps of STAT3. Gain of function mutations can involve tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate STAT3, mutations in cytokine and growth factor receptors causing their ligand independent activation, mutations in STAT3 that enhance and prolong its tyrosine phosphorylation and the autocrine or paracrine production and secretion of cytokines, most notably IL-6. Diminished deactivation of phosphorylated STAT3 can be due to the reduced expression of tyrosine phosphatases, inactivating mutations in these enzymes, silencing or functional inactivation of SOCS molecules, post-transcriptional inhibition of PIAS3 expression or deletion mutations in the lymphocyte adaptor protein, LNK. STAT3 variants that exhibit autonomous transactivation potential have been detected in 40% of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia in clonally expanded CD8(+) T cells.

However, many studies failed to detect XMRV and to verify these disease associations. Data suggesting the contamination of specimens in particular by PCR-based methods and recent reports demonstrating XMRV generation via recombination of two murine leukemia virus precursors raised serious doubts about XMRV being a genuine human pathogen. To elucidate cell tropism of XMRV, we generated replication competent XMRV reporter viruses encoding a green fluorescent protein or a secretable luciferase as tools to analyze virus infection of human cell lines or primary human cells. Transfection of proviral DNAs into LNCaP prostate cancer cells resulted in readily detectably reporter gene expression and production of progeny virus. Inoculation of known XMRV susceptible target cells revealed that these virions were infectious and expressed the reporter gene, allowing for a fast and highly sensitive quantification of XMRV infection. Both reporter viruses were capable of establishing a spreading infection in LNCaP and Raji B cells and could be easily passaged. However, after inoculation of primary human blood cells such as CD4 T cells, macrophages or dendritic cells, infection rates were very low, and a spreading infection was never established. In line with these results we found that supernatants derived from these XMRV infected primary cell types did not contain infectious virus. Thus, although XMRV efficiently replicated in some human cell lines, all tested primary cells were largely refractory to XMRV infection and did not support viral spread.

The highly conserved PIWI protein family regulates proliferative states of stem cells and their progeny in diverse organisms. A Human piwi gene (for clarity, the non-italicized ""piwi"" refers to the gene subfamily), HIWI (PIWIL1), is expressed in CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells and transient expression of HIWI in a human leukemia cell line drastically reduces cell proliferation, implying the potential function of these proteins in hematopoiesis. Here, we report that one of the three piwi genes in mice, Miwi2 (Piwil4), is expressed in primitive hematopoetic cell types within the bone marrow. Mice with a global deletion of all three piwi genes, Miwi, Mili, and Miwi2, are able to maintain long-term hematopoiesis with no observable effect on the homeostatic HSC compartment in adult mice.

However, the majority of patients achieving remission with TKI still have molecular evidences of disease persistence. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the disease persistence and recurrence. One of the hypotheses is that the primitive leukemic stem cells (LSCs) can survive in the presence of TKI. Understanding the mechanisms leading to TKI resistance of the LSCs in CML is a critical issue but is limited by availability of cells from patients. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from CD34(+) blood cells isolated from CML patients (CML-iPSCs) as a model for studying LSCs survival in the presence of TKI and the mechanisms supporting TKI resistance. Interestingly, CML-iPSCs resisted to TKI treatment and their survival did not depend on BCR-ABL1, as for primitive LSCs. Induction of hematopoietic differentiation of CML-iPSC clones was reduced compared to normal clones. Hematopoietic progenitors obtained from iPSCs partially recovered TKI sensitivity. Notably, different CML-iPSCs obtained from the same CML patients were heterogeneous, in terms of BCR-ABL1 level and proliferation. Thus, several clones of CML-iPSCs are a powerful model to decipher all the mechanisms leading to LSC survival following TKI therapy and are a promising tool for testing new therapeutic agents.",,"['Bedel, Aurelie', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Taillepierre, Miguel', 'Lagarde, Valerie', 'Dabernat, Sandrine', 'Dubus, Pierre', 'Charaf, Lucie', 'Beliveau, Francois', 'de Verneuil, Hubert', 'Richard, Emmanuel', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Moreau-Gaudry, Francois']","['Bedel A', 'Pasquet JM', 'Lippert E', 'Taillepierre M', 'Lagarde V', 'Dabernat S', 'Dubus P', 'Charaf L', 'Beliveau F', 'de Verneuil H', 'Richard E', 'Mahon FX', 'Moreau-Gaudry F']","['Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des maladies genetiques et cancers, Bordeaux, France ; Universite Bordeaux Segalen, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2013/09/24 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2013/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0071596 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-20261 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 23;8(8):e71596. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071596. eCollection 2013.,PMC3751925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CEL involves the presence of clonal genetic markers, such as a fusion of FIP1-like 1 protein and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, or F/P) or PDGFRalpha-activating mutations. METHODS: Sixteen patients with HES/CEL were enrolled in the phase 2 nilotinib registration trial (NCT00109707) and treated with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily. The median duration of treatment was 95 days (range 3-1,079). RESULTS: Twelve patients had HES: 1 achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR), 3 achieved stable disease, 3 had progressive disease, and 5 were not evaluable for response. Four patients had CEL: 2 with the F/P fusion and 2 with PDGFRalpha-activating mutations. Both patients with an F/P fusion achieved a CHR; 1 also achieved a complete molecular response (CMR). Of the 2 patients with PDGFRalpha-activating mutations, 1 had stable disease and the other achieved CMR. At 24 months, overall survival in the HES group was 75.0 % (95 % CI 50.5-100.0) and no patients in the CEL group died. Median survival was not yet reached after a median follow-up of 32 months. The most common grade 3/4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities were lymphocytopenia (31.3 %) and neutropenia (25.0 %). The most common drug-related nonhematologic grade 3/4 adverse event was pruritus, which occurred in 2 patients (12.5 %).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the first line therapy is based on the combination of fludarabine, a nucleoside analogue, and rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and there are presently no HDAC inhibitors are used to manage CLL. In the present study, we found that the addition of valproic acid (VPA), a HDAC inhibitor, increases cell death in B-cell-neoplasm-derived cell lines, BJAB, NALM-6 and I-83. This increased apoptosis caused release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspases, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of a ROS scavenger inhibited cell death induced by the VPA-fludarabine combination. In contrast, blocking the death receptor pathway failed to inhibit VPA increased fludarabine induced apoptosis. Combination of VPA and fludarabine treatment decreased both total and phosphorylated levels of AKT, an important anti-apoptotic protein, and ATM, a pivotal protein in DNA damage response. Chemical inhibition of AKT or ATM was sufficient to enhance fludarabine-induced apoptosis. We next examined patient samples from a local clinical trial where relapsed CLL patients were treated with VPA and examined the effects of VPA on AKT and ATM in vivo. After 30 days, there was a reduction in ATM levels in three out of the four patients treated, while AKT phosphorylation was reduced only in one patient. Taken together, VPA reduces ATM levels, thereby increasing ROS-dependent cell death via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway when combined with fludarabine.",,"['Yoon, Ju-Yoon', 'Ishdorj, Ganchimeg', 'Graham, Bonnie A', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Yoon JY', 'Ishdorj G', 'Graham BA', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valproic Acid/*administration & dosage', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,,2013/09/24 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-013-0906-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2014 Jan;19(1):191-200. doi: 10.1007/s10495-013-0906-7.,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CEBPA was screened in a cohort of 2296 adult AML cases. Of 244 patients (10.6%) with CEBPA mutations, 140 cases (6.1%) were single-mutated (CEBPAsm) and 104 cases (4.5%) were double-mutated (CEBPAdm). Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotype in 172/244 (70.5%) of CEBPAmut cases, whereas in 72/244 cases (29.5%) at least one cytogenetic aberration was detected. Concurrent molecular mutations were seen less frequently in CEBPAdm than in CEBPAsm AML cases (69.2% vs 88.6% P<0.001). In detail, the spectrum of concurrent mutations was different in both groups with the frequent occurrence of GATA1 and WT1 mutations in CEBPAdm patients. In contrast, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations were detected more frequently in CEBPAsm cases.

Using different EBV-immortalized B-cell models, we showed that only RelA activation increased both survival and cell growth. RelB activity was induced secondarily to RelA activation and repressed RelA DNA binding by trapping the p50 subunit. Reciprocally, RelA activation repressed RelB activity by increasing expression of its inhibitor p100. To search for such reciprocal inhibition at the transcriptional level, we studied gene expression profiles of our RelA and RelB regulatable cellular models. Ten RelA-induced genes and one RelB-regulated gene, ARNTL2, were repressed by RelB and RelA, respectively. Apart from this gene, RelB signature was included in that of RelA Functional groups of RelA-regulated genes were for control of energy metabolism, genetic instability, protection against apoptosis, cell cycle and immune response. Additional functions coregulated by RelA and/or RelB were autophagy and plasma cell differentiation. Altogether, these results demonstrate a cross-inhibition between RelA and RelB and suggest that, in fine, RelB was subordinated to RelA.

LC50 values were determined by MTT cytotoxicity assays for 29 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 12 acute myeloid leukemia patient samples and correlated with protein expression levels of the constitutive proteasome subunits (beta5, beta1, beta2) and their immunoproteasome counterparts (beta5i, beta1i, beta2i). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were up to 5.5-fold more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than acute myeloid leukemia cells (P<0.001) and the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone proved additive/synergistic in the majority of patient specimens. Although total proteasome levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cells did not differ significantly, the ratio of immuno/constitutive proteasome was markedly higher in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells over acute myeloid leukemia cells. In both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, increased ratios of beta5i/beta5, beta1i/beta1 and beta2i/beta2 correlated with increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors.

Our aim was to determine the role of mismatched unrelated cord blood grafts in transplantation for 802 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission. Using Cox regression we compared outcomes after 116 mismatched single or double cord blood transplants, 546 peripheral blood progenitor cell transplants and 140 bone marrow transplants. The characteristics of the recipients and their diseases were similar except cord blood recipients were younger, more likely to be non-Caucasians and more likely to have a low white blood cell count at diagnosis. There were differences in donor-recipient human leukocyte antigen-match depending on the source of the graft. Most adult donor transplants were matched at the allele-level considering human leukocyte antigens-A, -B, -C and -DRB1. In contrast, most cord blood transplants were mismatched and considered antigen-level matching; 57% were mismatched at two loci and 29% at one locus whereas only 29% of adult donor transplants were mismatched at one locus and none at two loci. There were no differences in the 3-year probabilities of survival between recipients of cord blood (44%), matched adult donor (44%) and mismatched adult donor (43%) transplants. Cord blood transplants engrafted slower and were associated with less grade 2-4 acute but similar chronic graft-versus-host disease, relapse, and transplant-related mortality. The survival of cord blood graft recipients was similar to that of recipients of matched or mismatched unrelated adult donor grafts and so cord blood should be considered a valid alternative source of stem cells for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the absence of a matched unrelated adult donor.",,"['Marks, David I', 'Woo, Kwang Ahn', 'Zhong, Xiaobo', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Barker, Juliet N', 'Brunstein, Claudio G', 'Gibson, John', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Olsson, Richard', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Marks DI', 'Woo KA', 'Zhong X', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Bachanova V', 'Barker JN', 'Brunstein CG', 'Gibson J', 'Kebriaei P', 'Lazarus HM', 'Olsson R', 'Perales MA', 'Pidala J', 'Savani B', 'Rocha V', 'Eapen M']",['David.Marks@UHBristol.nhs.uk.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Allografts', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/metabolism/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Unrelated Donors']",,,2013/09/24 06:00,2014/07/25 06:00,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.094193 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.094193 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Feb;99(2):322-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.094193.

There was no difference in cumulative incidence of relapse or GVHD between groups. Multivariate analysis revealed four significant adverse risk factors for DFS: donor other than HLA-identical sibling donor, not in remission at transplant, previous autologous transplant and recipient CMV positive. Chronic GVHD was associated with improved DFS in multivariate analysis predominantly due to a marked reduction in relapse (HR:0.44, P=0.003).

The construction of the electrochemical cytosensor involves the hierarchical assembly of dual aptamer-functionalized, multilayered graphene-Au nanoparticle electrode interface and the utilization of hybrid electrochemical nanoprobes co-functionalized with redox tags, horseradish peroxidase, and cell-targeting nucleic acid aptamers. The hybrid nanoprobes are multifunctional, capable of specifically targeting the cells of interest, amplifying the electrochemical signals, and generating distinguishable signals for multiplex cytosensing. The as-assembled electrode interface not only greatly facilitates the interfacial electron transfer process due to its high conductivity and surface area but also exhibits excellent biocompatibility and specificity for cell recognition and adhesion. A superstructured sandwich-type sensor geometry is adopted for electrochemical cytosensing, with the cells of interest sandwiched between the nanoprobes and the electrode interface. Such an electrochemical sensing strategy allows for ultrasensitive, multiplex acute leukemia cytosensing with a detection limit as low as ~350 cells per mL and a wide linear response range from 5 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(7) cells per mL for HL-60 and CEM cells, with minimal cross-reactivity and interference from non-targeting cells.

Advances have been made to understand the molecular pathogenesis underlying CLL progression and treatment resistance. We here review the available evidences concerning the role of the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the tumor microenvironment interactions in CLL pathogenesis. Antigen likely has a key role in the selection of the tumoral clone, the mutational status of immunoglobulin genes is a strong prognostic predictor and BCR signaling has been postulated to have a role for CLL trafficking and interaction with the stromal microenvironment. There is also important evidence, favoring a role for the microenvironment in CLL pathogenesis. Most, if not all, proliferative events occur in the lymph nodes and bone marrow, where leukemic cells receive through microenvironment interactions survival signals aiming to avoid apoptosis and acquire favorable tumoral growing conditions. In addition, the tumoral microenvironment appears to be the site where the acquisition of additional genetic lesions in the clone occur, which should greatly influence clinical outcome. The advent of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors which seem to be able to modulate microenvironment interactions and circumvent the p53 deletion have generated significant promise by raising the possibility that they could provide significant progress in disease treatment.",,"['Oppezzo, P', 'Dighiero, G']","['Oppezzo P', 'Dighiero G']","['1] Unit of Recombinant Protein, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay [2] Immunobiology Department, School of Medicine, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130920,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,,,2013/09/24 06:00,2013/09/24 06:01,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2013/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201345 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.45 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Sep 20;3:e149. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.45.,PMC3789209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISM is based on (i) molecular profiling and ex vivo drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) of patients' cancer cells to 187 oncology drugs, (ii) clinical implementation of therapies predicted to be effective, and (iii) studying consecutive samples from the treated patients to understand the basis of resistance. Here, application of ISM to 28 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) uncovered five major taxonomic drug-response subtypes based on DSRT profiles, some with distinct genomic features (e.g., MLL gene fusions in subgroup IV and FLT3-ITD mutations in subgroup V). Therapy based on DSRT resulted in several clinical responses. After progression under DSRT-guided therapies, AML cells displayed significant clonal evolution and novel genomic changes potentially explaining resistance, whereas ex vivo DSRT data showed resistance to the clinically applied drugs and new vulnerabilities to previously ineffective drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we demonstrate an ISM strategy to optimize safe and effective personalized cancer therapies for individual patients as well as to understand and predict disease evolution and the next line of therapy.

After introduction of a new standard and intermediate-risk ALL treatment protocol with prolonged continuous ASP treatment, two symptomatic DVTs in 10 patients were observed at the Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. To prevent further thrombotic complications yet ensuring continuous exposure to ASP, an AT substitution strategy was adopted in Helsinki. The same ALL treatment protocol is used without AT substitution in the other Nordic countries. In this retrospective study, we describe the effect of prolonged ASP treatment on AT and fibrinogen levels in children without AT substitution in Stockholm, Sweden (n = 39) and the AT substitution in children with AT activity below 0.55 kIU/l in Helsinki (n = 36, intervention group). The intervention group is compared with children treated similarly earlier in Helsinki without AT substitution (n = 10). The median lowest AT activity during the ASP treatment without AT substitution was 0.55 kIU/l. Fibrinogen level of 1.0 g/l or less was found in 14% of all routine samples during the ASP treatment. In the intervention group, 23 (64%) received AT concentrate. Two (20%) children had symptomatic DVT before initiation of the AT substitution and two (6%) thereafter. We conclude that most children are exposed to low AT activity during ASP treatment predisposing to thrombosis.

There is a substantial need for new chemotherapeutic drugs effective against this cancer. Doxorubicin (DOX), used for treatment of leukemias and solid tumors, is poorly efficacious when it is administered systemically at conventional doses. Therefore, several strategies have been developed to reduce the side effects of this anthracycline treatment. In this study we compared the effect of DOX and doxorubicin-transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) on human leukemia cell lines: chronic erythromyeloblastoid leukemia (K562), sensitive and resistant (K562/DOX) to doxorubicin, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM). Experiments were also carried out on normal cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We analyzed the chemical structure of DOX-TRF conjugate by using mass spectroscopy. The in vitro growth-inhibition assay XTT, indicated that DOX-TRF is more cytotoxic for leukemia cells sensitive and resistant to doxorubicin and significantly less sensitive to normal cells compared to DOX alone. During the assessment of intracellular DOX-TRF accumulation it was confirmed that the tested malignant cells were able to retain the examined conjugate for longer periods of time than normal lymphocytes. Comparison of kinetic parameters showed that the rate of DOX-TRF efflux was also slower in the tested cells than free DOX. The results presented here should contribute to the understanding of the differences in antitumor activities of the DOX-TRF conjugate and free drug.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A tetrameric 70kDa galactose specific lectin was purified using two step simple purification protocol which involved affinity chromatography on AF-BlueHC650M and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The lectin was adsorbed on AF-BlueHC650M and desorbed using 1M NaCl in the starting buffer. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 yielded a major peak absorbance that gave two bands of 15kDa and 20kDa in SDS PAGE. Hemagglutination activity was completely preserved, when the temperature was in the range of 20-60 degrees C. However, drastic reduction in activity occurred at temperatures above 60 degrees C. Full hemagglutination activity was retained at ambient pH 4-12. Thereafter no activity was observed above pH 13. Hemaglutination of the lectin was inhibited by d-galactose.

But the role of epigenetic processes in photodynamic injury of normal brain tissue is unknown. METHODS: 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), was used to photosensitize mouse cerebral cortex. PpIX accumulation in cortical tissue was measured spectrofluorometrically. Hematoxylin/eosin, gallocyanin-chromalum and immunohistochemical staining were used to study morphological changes in PDT-treated cerebral cortex. Proteomic antibody microarrays were used to evaluate expression of 112 proteins involved in epigenetic regulation. RESULTS: ALA administration induced 2.5-fold increase in the PpIX accumulation in the mouse brain cortex compared to untreated mice. Histological study demonstrated PDT-induced injury of some neurons and cortical vessels. ALA-PDT induced dimethylation of histone H3, upregulation of histone deacetylases HDAC-1 and HDAC-11, and DNA methylation-dependent protein Kaiso that suppressed transcriptional activity. Upregulation of HDAC-1 and H3K9me2 was confirmed immunohistochemically. Down-regulation of transcription factor FOXC2, PABP, and hBrm/hsnf2a negatively regulated transcription. Overexpression of phosphorylated histone H2AX indicated activation of DNA repair, but down-regulation of MTA1/MTA1L1 and PML - impairment of DNA repair. Overexpression of arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 correlated with up-regulation of transcription factor E2F4 and importin alpha5/7. CONCLUSION: ALA-PDT injures and kills some but not all neurons and caused limited microvascular alterations in the mouse cerebral cortex. It alters expression of some proteins involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription, histone modification, DNA repair, nuclear protein import, and proliferation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate epigenetic markers of photo-oxidative injury of normal brain tissue.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Demyanenko, S V', 'Uzdensky, A B', 'Sharifulina, S A', 'Lapteva, T O', 'Polyakova, L P']","['Demyanenko SV', 'Uzdensky AB', 'Sharifulina SA', 'Lapteva TO', 'Polyakova LP']","['Southern Federal University, Rostov-on-Don 344090, Russia.

The role of these oncoproteins in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) etiology has been well studied. Conversely, the function of native RUNX1 in promoting A-E- and C-S-mediated leukemias has remained elusive. We show that wild-type RUNX1 is required for the survival of t(8;21)-Kasumi-1 and inv(16)-ME-1 leukemic cells. RUNX1 knockdown in Kasumi-1 cells (Kasumi-1(RX1-KD)) attenuates the cell-cycle mitotic checkpoint, leading to apoptosis, whereas knockdown of A-E in Kasumi-1(RX1-KD) rescues these cells. Mechanistically, a delicate RUNX1/A-E balance involving competition for common genomic sites that regulate RUNX1/A-E targets sustains the malignant cell phenotype. The broad medical significance of this leukemic cell addiction to native RUNX1 is underscored by clinical data showing that an active RUNX1 allele is usually preserved in both t(8;21) or inv(16) AML patients, whereas RUNX1 is frequently inactivated in other forms of leukemia.

However, PTEN is also tightly controlled by various non-genomic mechanisms. This review focuses on those mechanisms, namely on the epigenetic silencing of PTEN, post-transcriptional regulation by non-coding RNAs and post-translational modification. We summarise their involvement in cancer in general, and place some emphasis on leukaemia, where PTEN genetic lesions are relatively uncommon and, strikingly, high levels of PTEN expression frequently associate with PTEN functional inactivation. Overall, it is apparent that rather than looking strictly for PTEN genetic lesions and PTEN expression status, the key to evaluating the real impact of PTEN as a 'quasi-insufficient' tumour suppressor must rely on the complete understanding of PTEN's 'functional dose', incorporating the multiple layers of PTEN regulation in the cell that are ultimately compromised in a given cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advances in understanding the biology of B-cell malignancies have resulted in the development of novel agents targeting key prosurvival pathways in the neoplastic B cell. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to summarize current literature on the emerging therapeutic approaches in CLL and B-cell malignancies. METHODS: A literature review was performed, identifying pathways and key clinical trials involving novel therapies in CLL, with special emphasis on B-cell receptor (BCR)-targeting agents. RESULTS: Understanding the biology of the BCR-signaling pathway has led to identification of novel molecular targets. Most notably, inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-delta have entered clinical trials and demonstrated high response rates in CLL, including high-risk disease. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors may evolve into an alternative therapeutic approach in CLL. New drugs that target molecules within and outside of the BCR-signaling pathway have shown promise in preclinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: Both preclinical and early clinical trial results involving novel targeted therapies suggest that the standard treatment paradigm in CLL and B-cell malignancies will soon change. Particular attention should be paid to the BCR-targeting agents, whose favorable adverse effect profile may improve the lives of elderly patients with CLL.","['(c) 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

The goal is to search for a synergistic effect and thereby reduce the required dose and inhibit the development of resistance. An advanced model-free approach for data exploration and analysis, based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and experimental design is proposed to predict and quantify the synergism of drugs. The proposed method non-linearly correlates the concentrations of drugs with the cytotoxicity of the mixture, providing the possibility of choosing the optimal drug combination that gives the maximum synergism. The use of ANN allows for the prediction of the cytotoxicity of each combination of drugs in the chosen concentration interval. The method was validated by preparing and experimentally testing the combinations with the predicted highest synergistic effect. In all cases, the data predicted by the network were experimentally confirmed.

The KiKK study has retriggered the debate as to the cause(s) of these increased cancers. A suggested hypothesis is that the increased cancers arise from radiation exposures to pregnant women near NPPs. However any theory has to account for the >10,000 fold discrepancy between official dose estimates from NPP emissions and observed increased risks. An explanation may be that doses from spikes in NPP radionuclide emissions are significantly larger than those estimated by official models which are diluted through the use of annual averages. In addition, risks to embryos/fetuses are greater than those to adults and haematopoietic tissues appear more radiosensitive in embryos/fetuses than in newborn babies.

METHODS: MicroRNA microarray was applied to assess the miRNAs expression profile of gastric cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-29c in 64 cases of gastric cancer tissues and corresponding normal gastric epithelium, as well as cell lines GES-1, BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were applied to detect the effects of forced expression of miR-29c in gastric cancer BGC-823 cells including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and drug sensitivity. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the targeted relationship between miR-29c and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). RESULTS: Compared with normal gastric epithelium, seven microRNAs (miR-374b*, miRPlus-E1212, miR-338-5p, miR-297, miR-21, miR-135b, miR-18a) were significantly up-regulated more than 2-folds, and nine microRNAs (miR-29b-2*, miR-1260, miRPlus-E1241, miR-S1-5p, miR-148a, miR-29c, miR-647, miR-196b*, ebv-miR-BART5) were significantly down-reguated in gastric cancer tissues. The average expression level of miR-29c in gastric cancer tissues was 0.70 +/- 0.34 and in corresponding normal epithelium was 1.00 +/- 0.06 (P < 0.05). miR-29c expression was related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, Lauren classification, Borrmann classification and Ming classification (P < 0.05). The poorer differentiation degree of gastric cell lines, the lower was miR-29c expression level (P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-29c in gastric cancer BGC-823 cells suppressed cell proliferation, stimulated cell apoptosis, induced cell cycle arrest in S phase and increased the chemotherapy sensitivity to drug docetaxel (all were P < 0.05). The average expression level of Mcl-1 mRNA in gastric cancer tissues was 3.47 +/- 1.34 and corresponding epithelialium was 1.00 +/- 0.20 (P < 0.05). The expression level of miR-29c was negatively related with that of Mcl-1 mRNA in gastric cancer tissues. miR-29c directly targeted to regulation of Mcl-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: There are special miRNA expression profile in gastric cancer. The expression of miR-29c is closely related to biological behavior of human gastric cancer. miR-29c is involved in targeted regulation of Mcl-1, and may be one of mechanisms of the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.",,"['Ma, Xiao-qiu', 'Wang, Lin-pei', 'Luo, Qi-cong', 'Cai, Jian-chun']","['Ma XQ', 'Wang LP', 'Luo QC', 'Cai JC']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, Xiamen Cancer Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361003, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Taxoids/therapeutic use', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Burden']",,,2013/09/24 06:00,2014/03/01 06:00,['2013/09/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2013.05.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2013 May;35(5):325-30. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2013.05.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched for SRs published from inception to November 2012. SRs were selected independently based on predefined inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of SRs included was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) checklist. Nine SRs met all inclusion criteria. Six reviews addressing the association between AE and cancer suggest a decreased risk of glioma, meningioma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with current or previous AE. One SR reported a consistent positive association of AE with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Diabetes mellitus type 1 and multiple sclerosis (MS) were not significantly related to AE in reviews based on cross-sectional and case-control studies. Patients with AE appear to be at decreased risk of brain tumors.

While the mechanism of siRNA delivery into the cytoplasmic compartment by peptide transduction domains has not been well studied, our analysis of melittin derivatives indicates that concurrent nanocomplex disassembly and peptide-mediated endosomolysis are crucial to siRNA transfection. Importantly, in the case of the most active derivative, p5RHH, this process is initiated by acidic pH, indicating that endosomal acidification after macropinocytosis can trigger siRNA release into the cytoplasm.

We assessed the ability of its ethanolic and phenolic-rich extracts and its major phenolic compound, sinapinic acid, possessing histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity to inhibit proliferation of 5 human cancer cell lines. METHODS: HeLa cells were used to study HDAC inhibitory activity of the extracts, sinapinic acid, and a well-known HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate. Five human cancer cell lines and one non-cancer cell line were used to study antiproliferative activities of the plant extracts, sinapinic acid and sodium butyrate, comparatively. RESULTS: Results indicated that ethanolic and phenolic-rich extracts of H. formicarum Jack. rhizome possessed both antiproliferative activity and HDAC inhibitory activity in HeLa cells. Sinapinic acid, despite its lower HDAC inhibitory activity than the well-known HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate, inhibited the growth of HeLa and HT29 cells more effectively than sodium butyrate. However, sinapinic acid inhibited the growth of HCT116 and Jurkat cells less effectively than sodium butyrate. The non-cancer cell line (Vero cells) and breast cancer cell line (MCF-7 cells) appeared to be resistant to both sinapinic acid and sodium butyrate. The growth inhibitory effects of the ethanolic and phenolic-rich extracts and sinapinic acid in HeLa cells were mediated by induction of apoptosis.

Conversion can occur from the earliest specified PGCs. The entire process can be tracked from single cells. It is driven by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the downstream transcription factor STAT3. In contrast, LIF signaling is not required during germ cell ontogeny. We surmise that ectopic LIF/STAT3 stimulation reconstructs latent pluripotency and self-renewal.

Assessment of the level of amp c-MYC or amp MLL in the cases with trisomy 8 (+8) or trisomy 11 (+11) and myeloid malignances is necessary for a more precise estimation of the disease progression.

Among the somatic mutations identified by this approach are ones that target components of the spliceosome, a ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the posttranscriptional processing of primary transcripts to form mature messenger RNA species. These mutations were initially detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome, but can also occur at relatively high frequency in some solid tumors, including uveal malignant melanoma, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. Their presence in a variety of malignancies suggests that the spliceosomal mutations may play a fundamental role in defining the malignant phenotype. The development and testing of drugs that eliminate cells bearing a spliceosomal mutation, or normalize their altered transcript splicing patterns, are therefore a priority. Here, we summarize the effects of spliceosome-associated mutations on transcript processing in vitro and in vivo, and their impact on disease initiation and/or progression and patient outcome. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of compounds already known to target splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1), an essential component of the spliceosome that is frequently mutated.",,"['Scott, Linda M', 'Rebel, Vivienne I']","['Scott LM', 'Rebel VI']","[""Affiliations of authors: Diamantina Institute, and Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (LMS); Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (LMS); Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, Cancer Therapy and Research Center, and the Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio (VIR).""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130919,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['djt257 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djt257 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 Oct 16;105(20):1540-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djt257.

So far, no effective therapy is available for these patients. We and others have shown recently that neoplastic MC in ASM and MCL express antiapoptotic Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. In this study, we examined the effects of the pan-Bcl-2 family blocker obatoclax (GX015-070) on primary neoplastic MC, the human MC leukemia cell line HMC-1, and the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. Obatoclax was found to inhibit proliferation in primary human neoplastic MC (IC(5)(0): 0.057 muM), in HMC-1.2 cells expressing KIT D816V (IC(5)(0): 0.72 muM), and in HMC-1.1 cells lacking KIT D816V (IC(5)(0): 0.09 muM), as well as in C2 cells (IC(5)(0): 0.74 muM). The growth-inhibitory effects of obatoclax in HMC-1 cells were accompanied by an increase in expression of Puma, Noxa, and Bim mRNA, as well as by apoptosis, as evidenced by microscopy, TUNEL assay, and caspase cleavage. Viral-mediated overexpression of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, or Bcl-2 in HMC-1 cells was found to introduce partial resistance against apoptosis-inducing effects of obatoclax. We were also able to show that obatoclax synergizes with several other antineoplastic drugs, including dasatinib, midostaurin, and bortezomib, in producing apoptosis and/or growth arrest in neoplastic MC. Together, obatoclax exerts major growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MC and potentiates the antineoplastic activity of other targeted drugs.

Low level transient ROS generated after co-treatment with these phytochemicals led to activation of these two pathways. Both mTOR and MAPK pathways played important roles in co-treatment-induced apoptosis, by knocking down either mTOR or MAPKs inhibited apoptosis. Activation of mTOR, as evident from phosphorylation of its downstream effector eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, led to release of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) which was subsequently phosphorylated by JNK leading to translation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad without affecting the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xl.

This report describes a patient with acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML) whose presenting symptom was dyschromatopsia. METHODS: A 52-year-old female, previously in good health, presented with a disturbance of colour vision. On examination, there was bilateral reduction in visual acuity, impaired colour vision and severely constricted visual fields. Electrophysiological testing and colour contrast sensitivity (CCS) assessment were performed. RESULTS: CCS showed bilateral threshold elevation in the tritan axis of both eyes, right worse than left. Pattern ERG showed marked macular dysfunction in the right eye, but was normal in the left eye. Full-field ERGs fell within the normal range. Pattern VEPs were reduced in the right eye, without peak time shift; flash VEPs showed bilateral delay. Investigation showed severe anaemia, and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of acute AML. There was symptomatic improvement in visual acuity and colour vision following blood transfusion and initiation of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first case report of dyschromatopsia in AML with symptomatic improvement following treatment.

METHODS: The hepatic lipogenesis pathway was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Biochemical variables were assessed using a clinical chemistry analyser. RESULTS: Serum triacylglycerols and liver expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) were significantly decreased in Prep1 hypomorphic heterozygous (Prep1 (i/+) ) mice compared with their non-hypomorphic littermates. Upstream FAS expression, phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC)zeta, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) increased in Prep1 (i/+) mice, while protein and mRNA levels of the lipid phosphatase inhibitor of PKCzeta, SH2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2), was more than 60% reduced. Consistent with these findings, HepG2 cells transfected with Prep1 cDNA exhibited increased triacylglycerol accumulation and FAS expression, with strongly reduced PKCzeta, LKB1, AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. Further experiments revealed the presence of both Prep1 and its major partner Pbx1 at the Ship2 (also known as Inppl1) promoter. PBX-regulating protein 1 (PREP1) and pre-B cell leukaemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) enhanced Ship2 transcription. The PREP1HR mutant, which is unable to bind PBX1, exhibited no effect on Ship2 function, indicating transcriptional activation of Ship2 by the PREP1/PBX1 complex.

Zebularine (ZB) is a potent DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and has been associated with gene demethylation and enhancement of tumor chemosensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ZB, alone or combined with chemotherapeutics (methotrexate and vincristine), on childhood ALL cell lines. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and clonogenic capacity were studied in Jurkat and ReH cell lines. Bisulfite modification, followed by methylation-specific PCR was carried out to evaluate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) methylation status. Gene expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and AhR was assessed using qRT-PCR. Both cell cultures were sensitive to ZB, showing a dose-dependent and time-dependent response (P<0.05). ZB induced apoptosis and decreased clonogenic capacity in both cell lines. Combination with methotrexate resulted in a strong synergistic effect, whereas combination with vincristine led to an antagonistic response in both cell lines. ZB treatment decreased gene expression of the three DNMTs and induced AhR gene promoter demethylation and its re-expression.

VDAC1 also plays a key role in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, interacting with anti-apoptotic proteins. Resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis involves quenching the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by over-expression of anti-apoptotic/pro-survival hexokinase (HK) and Bcl-2 family proteins, proteins that mediate their anti-apoptotic activities via interaction with VDAC1. Using specifically designed VDAC1-based cell-penetrating peptides, we targeted these anti-apoptotic proteins to prevent their pro-survival/anti-apoptotic activities. Anti-apoptotic proteins are expressed at high levels in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable disease requiring innovative new approaches to improve therapeutic outcome. CLL is characterized by a clonal accumulation of mature neoplastic B cells that are resistant to apoptosis. Specifically, we demonstrate that the VDAC1-based peptides (Antp-LP4 and N-Terminal-Antp) selectively kill peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from CLL patients, yet spare those obtained from healthy donors. The cell death induction competence of the peptides was well correlated with the amount of double positive CD19/CD5 cancerous CLL PBMCs, further illustrating their selectivity toward cancer cells. Moreover, these VDAC1-based peptides induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondria-mediated pathway, reflected in membrane blebbing, condensation of nuclei, DNA fragmentation, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased cellular ATP levels and detachment of HK, all leading to apoptotic cell death. Thus, the mode of action of the peptides involves decreasing energy production and inducing apoptosis. Over 27 versions of cell-penetrating VDAC1-based peptides were designed and screened to identify the most stable, short and apoptosis-inducing peptides toward CLL-derived lymphocytes. In this manner, three optimized peptides suitable for in vivo studies were identified. This study thus reveals the potential of VDAC1-based peptides as an innovative and effective anti-CLL therapy.",,"['Prezma, T', 'Shteinfer, A', 'Admoni, L', 'Raviv, Z', 'Sela, I', 'Levi, I', 'Shoshan-Barmatz, V']","['Prezma T', 'Shteinfer A', 'Admoni L', 'Raviv Z', 'Sela I', 'Levi I', 'Shoshan-Barmatz V']","['Department of Life Sciences and the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, BeerSheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130919,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.6.- (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hexokinase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1/*chemistry']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/09/21 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013316 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.316 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Sep 19;4:e809. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.316.,PMC3789174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs interact preferentially with specific targets that are mutated and/or overexpressed in malignant cells. A group of such targets are the tyrosine kinases, against which a number of inhibitors (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs) have been developed. Imatinib, a TKI with targets that include the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (bcr-abl) fusion protein kinase and mast/stem cell growth factor receptor kinase (c-Kit), was the first clinically successful drug of this type and revolutionized the treatment and prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This success paved the way for the development of other TKIs for the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. To date, 14 TKIs have been approved for clinical use and many more are under investigation. All these agents are given orally and are substrates of a range of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes. In addition, some TKIs are capable of inhibiting their own transporters and metabolizing enzymes, making their disposition and metabolism at steady-state unpredictable. A given dose can therefore give rise to markedly different plasma concentrations in different patients, favoring the selection of resistant clones in the case of subtherapeutic exposure, and increasing the risk of toxicity if dosage is excessive. The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge of the clinical pharmacokinetics and known adverse effects of the TKIs that are available for clinical use and to provide practical guidance on the implications of these data in patient management, in particular with respect to therapeutic drug monitoring.",,"['Josephs, Debra H', 'Fisher, Danielle S', 'Spicer, James', 'Flanagan, Robert J']","['Josephs DH', 'Fisher DS', 'Spicer J', 'Flanagan RJ']","[""*Department of Medical Oncology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; and daggerToxicology Unit, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Bessemer Wing, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2013/09/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/FTD.0b013e318292b931 [doi]', '00007691-201310000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2013 Oct;35(5):562-87. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318292b931.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three GTX given to 74 patients were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS: GTX were discontinued because of clinical improvement more often in patients with severe infections than in patients without severe infections (27 vs. 12%; p </= 0.002), whereas deaths resulted in discontinuation of GTX therapy less often in patients with severe infections than without (8 vs. 39%; p </= 0.002). Patients who died by 12 weeks after GTX initiation were more likely to have leukemia (p = 0.03), not to have recovery of neutrophil counts (p < 0.0001), and to have started GTX during a critical care unit stay (p < 0.001). Uses of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (p </= 0.02) and interferon-gamma (p </= 0.04) were more common in patients who survived. In patients with comorbidities (31%; odds ratio, OR, 12.6; 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.4-65.7; p </= 0.003), GTX was started in the critical care unit (OR 8.8; 95% CI 2.5-30.9; p < 0.001), and a high total bilirubin level at the end of GTX (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1-4.2; p = 0.03) had a higher probability of death 12 weeks after GTX therapy commenced.

Transgenic mice expressing the human SALL4B allele develop AML, which indicates that this molecule contributes to leukemia development and maintenance. However, the underlying mechanism of SALL4-dependent AML progression is unknown. Using SALL4B transgenic mice, we observed that HoxA9 was significantly upregulated in SALL4B leukemic cells compared with wild-type controls. Downregulation of HoxA9 in SALL4B leukemic cells led to decreased replating capacity in vitro and delayed AML development in recipient mice. In primary human AML cells, downregulation of SALL4 led to decreased HOXA9 expression and enhanced apoptosis. We found that SALL4 bound a specific region of the HOXA9 promoter in leukemic cells. SALL4 overexpression led to enhanced binding of histone activation markers at the HOXA9 promoter region, as well as increased HOXA9 expression in these cells. Furthermore, we observed that SALL4 interacted with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and co-occupied the HOXA9 promoter region with MLL in AML leukemic cells, which suggests that a SALL4/MLL pathway may control HOXA9 expression.

Interestingly, some ERKs stay active in mouse ES cells which are maintained in regular medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Yet, the upstream signaling for ERK activation and their roles in mouse ES cells, other than promoting or priming differentiation, have not been determined. Here we found that mouse ES cells express three forms of Raf kinases, A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf. Knocking-down each single Raf member failed to affect the sustained ERK activity, neither did A-Raf and B-Raf double knockdown or B-Raf and C-Raf double knockdown change it in ES cells. Interestingly, B-Raf and C-Raf double knockdown, not A-Raf and B-Raf knockdown, inhibited the maximal ERK activation induced by LIF, concomitant with the slower growth of ES cells. On the other hand, A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf triple knockdown markedly inhibited both the maximal and sustained ERK activity in ES cells. Moreover, Raf triple knockdown, similar to the treatment of U-0126, an MEK inhibitor, significantly inhibited the survival and proliferation of ES cells, thereby compromising the colony propagation of mouse ES cells. In summary, our data demonstrate that all three Raf members are required for ERK activation in mouse ES cells and are involved in growth and survival of mouse ES cells.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

WP1066 alters the severity of chronic epilepsy without affecting SE or cell death. Early WP1066 administration reduces known downstream targets of STAT3 transcription 24h after SE including cyclin D1 and mcl-1 levels, known for their roles in cell-cycle progression and cell survival, respectively.

METHODS: Five consecutive patients with cSCC and CLL who had a PET/CT scan for the purposes of cSCC staging between July 2000 and July 2010 were analyzed. PET/CT findings were compared to histopathology from subsequent neck dissection. RESULTS: PET/CT can distinguish nodal cSCC from leukemic infiltration with high specificity, allowing prompt appropriate management of nodal disease. CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT is a promising modality for nodal staging in patients with cSCC and CLL, with the potential to improve outcomes in this poor prognosis group.

When normal mouse bone marrow (BM) cells were cocultured with Med1(+/+) MEFs or BM stromal cells in the presence of anti-FGF7 antibody, the growth of BM cells and the number of long-time culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) decreased significantly. Anti-FGF7 antibody also attenuated the proliferation and cobblestone formation of MB1 stromal cell-dependent myeloblastoma cells. The addition of recombinant FGF7 to the coculture of BM cells and Med1(-/-) MEFs increased BM cells and LTC-ICs. FGF7 and its cognate receptor, FGFR2IIIb, were undetectable in BM cells, but MEFs and BM stromal cells expressed both. FGF7 activated downstream targets of FGFR2IIIb in Med1(+/+) and Med1(-/-) MEFs and BM stromal cells.

Using transgenic Tg(fli-1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos, interactions of PPARalpha and adenosine receptors in angiogenesis were evaluated under hypoxic conditions. Epifluorescent microscopy was used to assess angiogenesis by counting the number of intersegmental (ISV) and dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (DLAV) at 28 h post-fertilization (hpf). Hypoxia (6h) stimulated angiogenesis as the number of ISV and DLAV increased by 18-fold (p<0.01) and 100 +/- 8% (p<0.001), respectively, at 28 hpf. Under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, WY-14643 (10 muM), a PPARalpha activator, stimulated angiogenesis at 28 hpf, while MK-886 (0.5 muM), an antagonist of PPARalpha, attenuated these effects. Compared to normoxic condition, adenosine receptor activation with NECA (10 muM) promoted angiogenesis more effectively under hypoxic conditions. Involvement of A2B receptor was implied in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis as MRS-1706 (10nM), a selective A2B antagonist attenuated NECA (10 muM)-induced angiogenesis.

This study investigated lipid profile abnormalities and hepatic steatosis among HCV-infected Egyptian children and adolescents who survived leukemia and lymphoma and evaluated impact on response to antiviral therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six leukemia/lymphoma cured children and adolescents (mean age: 12.47 +/- 3.56 years) with chronic HCV infection and 30 healthy controls (mean age: 11.64 +/- 3.96 years) were enrolled in this prospective study. Serum lipid profile and abdominal ultrasonography were done for all patients and controls. Guided liver biopsy with histopathological examination was done for 32 (88.9%) patients eligible for antiviral therapy. RESULTS: Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apo-B) in patients were significantly lower than in the control group (P </= .01, </= .01, and </= .05, respectively). Among those who underwent liver biopsy (n = 32), macrovesicular hepatic steatosis associated with chronic hepatitis C was documented in 10 children (31.3%). Body mass index was significantly higher (P </= .05) and apo-B was significantly lower in steatotic (P </= .05) than non-steatotic HCV-infected children. Liver span by ultrasound, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and apo-B were independent predictors for hepatic steatosis (P < .001, <.001, and <.05, respectively). A significantly worse response to interferon alpha 2-b plus ribavrin treatment for HCV was reported among children with steatosis (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed low serum lipids in HCV-infected children with cured leukemia/lymphoma.

These diseases have mild- and long-term consequences on the health. Little is known about the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of children and their families. The aims of this study were: to compare the QoL of the children and parents affected by IEMRD with the QoL of the general population and one pathology associated with long-term consequences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at the French Reference Center for inborn metabolic disorders (Marseille, France). Inclusion criteria were: a child with a diagnosis of organic aciduria, urea cycle defect, or maple syrups urine disease (MSUD). Socio-demographics, clinical data, and QoL were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 32 eligible families were included during a planned routine visit. Ten (47%, 95% CI 27-69%) children were affected by organic aciduria, six (29%, 95% CI 10-48%) by urea cycle defects, and five (24%, 95% CI 6-42%) by MSUD. Among the younger children, the general well-being was significantly lower in the children with IEMRD than in the leukemia children (58 +/- 16 versus 76 +/- 15, p = 0.012), and among the older children, the leisure activities were significantly lower in the children with IEMRD than in the leukemia children (29 +/- 18 versus 62 +/- 22, p < 10-3), while the relationships with teachers were better (76 +/- 23 versus 60 +/- 23, p = 0.01). The physical QoL score was lower in the parents than in the French norms (66 +/- 21 versus 75 +/- 1, p = 0.05). Factors modulating QoL were: eating and neurologic disorders, enteral nutrition, and feeding modalities. CONCLUSION: The children and the parents of children affected presented altered 'physical' and 'social' QoL scores compared with the norms and patients with leukemia and their families. Future studies based on larger cohort studies should determine the different weights of potential predictive factors of QoL.",,"['Fabre, Alexandre', 'Baumstarck, Karine', 'Cano, Aline', 'Loundou, Anderson', 'Berbis, Julie', 'Chabrol, Brigitte', 'Auquier, Pascal']","['Fabre A', 'Baumstarck K', 'Cano A', 'Loundou A', 'Berbis J', 'Chabrol B', 'Auquier P']","['EA3279, Self-perceived Health Assessment Research Unit, School of Medicine, Universite de la Mediterranee, 27 bd Jean Moulin, Marseille 13385, France. karine.baumstarck@univ-amu.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130919,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maple Syrup Urine Disease/diet therapy/psychology', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*diet therapy/*psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn/diet therapy/psychology']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/07/25 06:00,['2013/09/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7525-11-158 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-11-158 [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2013 Sep 19;11:158. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-11-158.,PMC3848736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 23 hematological malignancy patients admitted with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia with culture positive results, at our institute between June 2011 and December 2011. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were studied 12 males and 11 females, with a median age of 35 years. Most common diagnosis was acute leukemia (78%) with the majority of patients developing febrile neutropenia during the induction phase of treatment. Most common presenting symptoms were fever, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Primary site of infection was not found in 47% of patients while the rest had lung, gastro-intestinal and skin/soft-tissue infection. Overall 23 organisms were isolated during the study period, from blood (56%), sputum (46%), stool (23%), and nasal swab from one patient. Gram negative bacteria accounted for 78% of organisms while gram positive organisms accounted for 22% of the total isolates. The most common organisms were: Escherichia coli (43%), Staphylococcus aureus (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (17.4%). Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of these bacteria were studied. Gram negative bacterial infections were associated with higher mortality (89%). CONCLUSIONS: Induction phase of treatment in acute leukemia is the major cause of FN in hematological malignancies at our institute and gram negative organisms are the predominant organisms with E. coli as major isolate while S. aureus represents the most common gram positive organism. Amikacin and cefoperazone/sulbactum appears to be initial antibiotic appropriate to cover most gram negative pathogens while vancomycin to be added for suspected gram positive infections. FN represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hematological malignancy patients, high index of suspicion and early empirical antibiotics with supportive care are main interventions to reduce high mortality for these patients.

AIMS: To determine the yield of galactomannan (GM) assay for the diagnosis of probable IA, its temporal relationship with the computed tomography (CT) scans and correlation with mortality in AL and HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive neutropenic episodes (n=150) among inpatients aged >/=15 years with AL or recipients of HSCT were prospectively evaluated over 1(1/2) years. All patients underwent weekly serum GM assay and optical density index >0.5 for >/=2 samples was defined as positive. IA was diagnosed according to EORTC 2008 guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 150 episodes enrolled, 43 (28.7%) were diagnosed with IA: possible 25 (16.7%), probable 17 (11.3%) and proven 1 (0.7%). The yield of GM assay in diagnosing probable IA was 17/42 (40.5%). In 88.2% of probable IA episodes, GM was positive before high-resolution CT at a median of 10 days (range 1-16). In the episodes with >/=2 samples tested, fatality was higher in those >/=2 values positive for GM, compared to the rest (31% vs. 13.2%, odd ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.09-8.00; P=0.04).

Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) is a cofactor for lentiviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and targets lentiviral integration toward active transcription units in the host genome. In contrast to lentiviruses, murine leukemia virus (MLV), a gammaretrovirus, tends to integrate near transcription start sites. Here, we show that the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 interact with gammaretroviral INs and stimulate the catalytic activity of MLV IN in vitro. We mapped the interaction site to a characteristic structural feature within the BET protein extraterminal (ET) domain and to three amino acids in MLV IN. The ET domains of different BET proteins stimulate MLV integration in vitro and, in the case of BRD2, also in vivo. Furthermore, two small-molecule BET inhibitors, JQ1 and I-BET, decrease MLV integration and shift it away from transcription start sites. Our data suggest that BET proteins might act as chromatin-bound acceptors for the MLV preintegration complex.

Because interactions with the lipid microenvironment at budding sites could contribute to recruitment, we examined the contribution of the hydrophobicity of the F-MLV Env membrane-spanning domain (MSD) to its incorporation into HIV-1 particles. A series of F-MLV Env mutants that added or deleted one, two, or three leucines in the MSD were constructed. All six mutants retained the ability to be incorporated into HIV-1 particles, but the -1L, -2L, -3L, +1L, and +2L mutants were not capable of producing infectious particles. Surprisingly, the +3L Env glycoprotein was able to produce infectious particles and was constitutively fusogenic. However, when the cytoplasmic tail domains (CTDs) in the Env constructs were deleted, all six of the MSD mutants were able to produce infectious particles. Further mutational analyses revealed that the first 10 amino acids of the CTD is a critical regulator of infectivity. A similar phenotype was observed in HIV-1 Env upon addition of leucines in the MSD, with +1 and +2 leucine mutations greatly reducing Env activity, but +3 leucine mutations behaving similar to the wild type. Unlike F-MLV Env (+1L and +2L), HIV-1 Env (+1L and +2L) infectivity was not restored by deletion of the CTD.

We assessed retrospectively the efficacy of these two routes of administration in the LRF CLL4 trial. METHODS: A total of 777 patients were randomized from 1999-2004 to receive fludarabine, alone or with cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil. In 2001, a protocol amendment allowed the oral formulation. There were 117 assessable patients who received fludarabine intravenously and 252 who received it orally. A total of 387 patients given chlorambucil acted as a control group. RESULTS: Patients given oral fludarabine were less likely to receive the full dose (P = .0004) and experienced more, predominantly gastrointestinal, toxicity. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were not affected by the route of administration (PFS hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.40), but the overall rate of response to treatment appeared to be lower with the oral formulation (P = .003). However, patients recruited since 2001 were older (P = .03) and were more likely to have TP53 deletion, and response rates after 2001 were also lower in the chlorambucil group. After excluding patients with TP53 deletion, no significant difference in outcome was attributable to the route of administration. CONCLUSIONS: Although the LRF CLL4 data suggest no important difference in the effectiveness of oral compared with intravenous fludarabine, randomized trials are needed to reliably evaluate this comparison, particularly in combination with rituximab. Meanwhile, it is important to monitor compliance and gastrointestinal side effects with the oral route and to switch to intravenous therapy if a reduced dose is being received.",['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],"['Dearden, Claire E', 'Richards, Sue', 'Else, Monica', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Dearden CE', 'Richards S', 'Else M', 'Catovsky D', 'Hillmen P']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, The Royal Marsden Hospital and The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK. claire.dearden@rmh.nhs.uk.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101214,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocyctic leukemia', 'fludarabine', 'intravenous', 'oral', 'toxicity']",2011/06/01 00:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2013/09/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25776 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jun 1;117(11):2452-60. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25776.

We identified 95 phosphopeptides presented on the surface of primary hematological tumors and normal tissues, including 61 that were tumor-specific. Phosphopeptides were more prevalent on more aggressive and malignant samples. CD8(+) T cell lines specific for these phosphopeptides recognized and killed both leukemia cell lines and human leukocyte antigen-matched primary leukemia cells ex vivo. Notably, healthy individuals showed robust CD8(+) T cell responses against many of these phosphopeptides within the circulating memory compartment. This immunity was significantly reduced or absent in some leukemia patients.

For the pathogenic retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), these include widely expressed restriction factors, such as APOBEC3 proteins, TRIM5-alpha, BST2 (refs 4, 5) and SAMHD1 (refs 6, 7), as well as additional factors that are stimulated by type 1 interferon (IFN). Here we use both ectopic expression and gene-silencing experiments to define the human dynamin-like, IFN-induced myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MXB) protein as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infection and as a key effector of IFN-alpha-mediated resistance to HIV-1 infection. MX2 suppresses infection by all HIV-1 strains tested, has equivalent or reduced effects on divergent simian immunodeficiency viruses, and does not inhibit other retroviruses such as murine leukaemia virus. The Capsid region of the viral Gag protein dictates susceptibility to MX2, and the block to infection occurs at a late post-entry step, with both the nuclear accumulation and chromosomal integration of nascent viral complementary DNA suppressed. Finally, human MX1 (also known as MXA), a closely related protein that has long been recognized as a broadly acting inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses, including the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus, does not affect HIV-1, whereas MX2 is ineffective against influenza virus. MX2 is therefore a cell-autonomous, anti-HIV-1 resistance factor whose purposeful mobilization may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.",,"['Goujon, Caroline', 'Moncorge, Olivier', 'Bauby, Helene', 'Doyle, Tomas', 'Ward, Christopher C', 'Schaller, Torsten', 'Hue, Stephane', 'Barclay, Wendy S', 'Schulz, Reiner', 'Malim, Michael H']","['Goujon C', 'Moncorge O', 'Bauby H', 'Doyle T', 'Ward CC', 'Schaller T', 'Hue S', 'Barclay WS', 'Schulz R', 'Malim MH']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130918,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (MX2 protein, human)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HIV Infections/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control/*virology', 'HIV-1/classification/enzymology/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*immunology', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcription/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Replication']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/20 06:00'],"['2013/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nature12542 [pii]', '10.1038/nature12542 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2013 Oct 24;502(7472):559-62. doi: 10.1038/nature12542.

We have therefore studied the effect of terfenadine (an H1-histamine receptor antagonist) in prostate cancer cell lines. Our data demonstrate that terfenadine was effective against PC-3 and DU-145 cells (two prostate cancer cell lines). In contrast, based on the sulforhodamine B assay, loratadine had less potency while fexofenadine and diphenhydramine had little effect. Terfenadine induced the cleavage of Mcl-1 cleavage into a pro-apoptotic 28-kDa fragment and up-regulation of Bak, resulting in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol. The activation of caspase cascades was detected to be linked to terfenadine action. Bak up-regulation was also examined at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and Bak activation was validated based on conformational change to expose the N terminus. Terfenadine also induced an indirect-but not direct-DNA damage response through the cleavage and activation of caspase-2, phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, phosphorylation of RPA32 and acetylation of Histone H3; these processes were highly correlated to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of caspase cascades. In conclusion, terfenadine induced apoptotic signaling cascades against HRPCs in a sequential manner. The exposure of cells to terfenadine caused the up-regulation and activation of Bak and the cleavage of Mcl-1, leading to the loss of DeltaPsim and activation of caspase cascades which further resulted in DNA damage response and cell apoptosis.",,"['Wang, Wei-Ting', 'Chen, Yen-Hui', 'Hsu, Jui-Ling', 'Leu, Wohn-Jenn', 'Yu, Chia-Chun', 'Chan, She-Hung', 'Ho, Yunn-Fang', 'Hsu, Lih-Ching', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa']","['Wang WT', 'Chen YH', 'Hsu JL', 'Leu WJ', 'Yu CC', 'Chan SH', 'Ho YF', 'Hsu LC', 'Guh JH']","['School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Section 1, Jen-Ai Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130919,Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists, Non-Sedating)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '7BA5G9Y06Q (Terfenadine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists, Non-Sedating/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*physiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Histamine/physiology', 'Terfenadine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/agonists/*biosynthesis']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/08/26 06:00,['2013/09/20 06:00'],"['2013/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00210-013-0912-x [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2014 Jan;387(1):33-45. doi: 10.1007/s00210-013-0912-x.

An oncogenic function of cell surface GRP78 has been attributed to the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. We intend to use a novel anti-GRP78 monoclonal antibody (MAb159) to attenuate PI3K signaling and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MAb159 was characterized biochemically. Antitumor activity was tested in cancer cell culture, tumor xenograft models, tumor metastasis models, and spontaneous tumor models. Cancer cells and tumor tissues were analyzed for PI3K activity. MAb159 was humanized and validated for diagnostic and therapeutic application. RESULTS: MAb159 specifically recognized surface GRP78, triggered GRP78 endocytosis, and localized to tumors but not to normal organs in vivo. MAb159 inhibited tumor cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell death both in vitro and in vivo. In MAb159-treated tumors, PI3K signaling was inhibited without compensatory MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, MAb159 halted or reversed tumor progression in the spontaneous PTEN-loss-driven prostate and leukemia tumor models, and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models. Humanized MAb159, which retains high affinity, tumor specific localization, and the antitumor activity, was nontoxic in mice, and had desirable pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: GRP78-specific antibody MAb159 modulates the PI3K pathway and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.

We evaluated the influence of lipopolysaccharide stimulation on expression of TF antigen and activity on/in THP-1 human leukemia monocytic cells. Prior to stimulation, there were 240 +/- 60 TF molecules/cell on the cell surface and 510 +/- 180 molecules/cell in lysates (n = 8). Upon stimulation, TF antigen increased 10-fold on the cell surface and 16.5-fold in lysates. Coincidently, the intact cell factor (F)Xa generation by TF/FVIIa increased 11-fold. Correspondingly, TF-induced clotting activity increased 35.7 +/- 4.9-fold. The KM of the TF/FVIIa complex formed on the THP-1 surface and cell lysates for FX was 0.73 +/- 0.07 and 0.41 +/- 0.02 mumol/l and the kcat 59.4 +/- 1.8 and 44.6 +/- 0.1 s, respectively. For isolated and relipidated THP-1 cell TF, the efficiency of FXase was lower (KM = 1.54 mumol/l and kcat = 12.0 s). A similar comparison of isolated/relipidated vs. cell-surface TF in the synthetic coagulation proteome and corn trypsin inhibitor blood showed that the cell-surface TF-induced thrombin generation is more than 100-fold more efficient than that induced by purified/relipidated TF. These data indicate that the increase in monocytic cell TF activity upon stimulation is primarily related to an increased expression of TF protein, and that significantly higher specific activity of TF presented on cells than that of purified and relipidated protein suggests the presence of the cell membrane components which substantially enhance TF function.",,"['Butenas, Saulius', 'Gissel, Matthew', 'Krudysz-Amblo, Jolanta', 'Mann, Kenneth G']","['Butenas S', 'Gissel M', 'Krudysz-Amblo J', 'Mann KG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Vermont, Colchester, Vermont, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130916,England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,,,,,,2013/09/21 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/09/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MBC.0b013e3283658acc [doi]'],aheadofprint,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2013 Sep 16. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0b013e3283658acc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The oral cavity was examined for dental caries using def-t and DMF-T indices, gingival status was evaluated by using the modified gingival index, and the WHO oral toxicity scale was used to record oral mucositis. RESULTS: Statistical analysis was done by using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Both DMF-T and def-t were highest in children during the maintenance phase of the chemotherapy followed by the induction therapy with radiotherapy (I 2 ) and induction therapy (I 1 ) phases. The prevalence of gingival inflammation was highest in the maintenance phase of the chemotherapy followed by the induction therapy with radiotherapy (I 2 ) and Induction therapy (I 1 ) phases. Signs and severity of oral mucositis were highest in children undergoing induction therapy with radiotherapy (I 2 ).

Collapse of the bubbles releases high energy and may cause damage to exposed surfaces. We recently designed a set-up to exploit the destructive nature of hydrodynamic cavitation for biomedical purposes. We have previously shown that hydrodynamic cavitation could kill leukemia cells and erode kidney stones. In this study, we analyzed the effects of cavitation on prostate cells and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue. We showed that hydrodynamic cavitation could kill prostate cells in a pressure- and time-dependent manner. Cavitation did not lead to programmed cell death, i.e. classical apoptosis or autophagy activation. Following the application of cavitation, we observed no prominent DNA damage and cells did not arrest in the cell cycle.

Therefore, novel and effective therapies should be developed. In various malignancies, tumor cells can evade the host immune defenses, in which CD4+CD25+ regulatory Tcells (Treg) play an important role. Tregs maintain self-tolerance and homeostasis in the immune system, thereby suppressing the antitumor immune responses in cancer patients. Thus, Tregs are crucial in controlling antitumor immune responses. Several clinical studies have shown that the presence of Tregs at the tumor site was correlated with poor prognosis, and Tregs reportedly suppress the antigen-specific T-cell induction in immunotherapy. Therefore, controlling Treg function may be a promising immunotherapy. Based on the findings of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma research, Tregs have been shown to display high cell-surface expression of the CC chemokine receptor, CCR4. The anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody recognizes the CCR4 molecule and induces robust ADCC activity against CCR4-positive cells such as Tregs. Thus, Treg depletion using humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibodies may enhance the host immune response against tumors. The current ongoing clinical trial investigates the use of humanized anti-human-CCR4 monoclonal antibody, mogamulizumab, in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.",,"['Kurose, Koji', 'Ohue, Yoshihiro', 'Oka, Mikio']","['Kurose K', 'Ohue Y', 'Oka M']","['Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Using whole-exome sequencing of an MDS patient, we identified a somatic mutation in the BCOR gene also mutated in AML. Sequencing of BCOR and related BCORL1 genes in a cohort of 354 MDS patients identified 4.2% and 0.8% of mutations respectively. BCOR mutations were associated with RUNX1 (P = .002) and DNMT3A mutations (P = .015). BCOR is also mutated in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients (7.4%) and BCORL1 in AML patients with myelodysplasia-related changes (9.1%). Using deep sequencing, we show that BCOR mutations arise after mutations affecting genes involved in splicing machinery or epigenetic regulation. In univariate analysis, BCOR mutations were associated with poor prognosis in MDS (overall survival [OS]: P = .013; cumulative incidence of AML transformation: P = .005). Multivariate analysis including age, International Prognostic Scoring System, transfusion dependency, and mutational status confirmed a significant inferior OS to patients with a BCOR mutation (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-8.1; P = .008).

In previous studies, we showed that human and murine bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and human skin-derived stromal fibroblasts (hSDFs) acquired strong anti-tumor capacity, both in vitro and in vivo, once primed with Paclitaxel (PTX). In this report we investigate whether adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) behave similarly to BM-MSCs in their uptake and release of PTX in sufficient amounts to inhibit tumor proliferation in vitro. According to a standardized procedure, PTX primed AT-MSCs (AT-MSCsPTX) were washed and then subcultured to harvest their conditioned medium, which was then tested to evaluate its in vitro anti-tumor potential. We observed that AT-MSCsPTX were able to uptake PTX and release it in a time-dependent manner and that the released drug was active in vitro against proliferation of leukemia, anaplastic osteosarcoma, prostatic carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. These data confirm that AT-MSCs, as well as BM-MSCs, can be loaded in vitro with anti-cancer drugs. While the harvesting of BM-MSCs requires invasive procedures, AT-MSCs can be prepared from fat samples taken with little patient discomfort. For this reason, this source of stromal cells represents an important alternative to BM-MSCs in developing new tools for carrying and delivering anti-cancer drugs into tumor microenvironments.",,"['Bonomi, A', 'Cocce, V', 'Cavicchini, L', 'Sisto, F', 'Dossena, M', 'Balzarini, P', 'Portolani, N', 'Ciusani, E', 'Parati, E', 'Alessandri, G', 'Pessina, A']","['Bonomi A', 'Cocce V', 'Cavicchini L', 'Sisto F', 'Dossena M', 'Balzarini P', 'Portolani N', 'Ciusani E', 'Parati E', 'Alessandri G', 'Pessina A']","['Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*cytology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2013/11/02 06:00,['2013/09/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/03946320130260S105 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2013 Jan-Mar;26(1 Suppl):33-41. doi: 10.1177/03946320130260S105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of PRDM14 is tightly regulated and typically limited to ESCs and primordial germ cells; however, aberrant expression is associated with tumor initiation in a wide variety of human cancers, including breast cancer and leukemia. Here, we describe the generation of a Cre-recombinase-inducible mouse model for the spatial and temporal control of Prdm14 misexpression [ROSA26 floxed-stop Prdm14 (R26PR)]. When R26PR is mated to either of two Cre lines, Mx1-cre or MMTV-cre, mice develop early-onset T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with median overall survival of 41 and 64 days for R26PR;Mx1-cre and R26PR;MMTV-cre, respectively. T-ALL is characterized by the accumulation of immature single-positive CD8 cells and their widespread infiltration. Leukemia is preceded by a dramatic expansion of cells resembling hematopoietic stem cells and lymphoid-committed progenitors prior to disease onset, accompanied by a blockage in B-cell differentiation at the early pro-B stage. Rapid-onset PRDM14-induced T-ALL requires factors that are present in stem and progenitor cells: R26PR;dLck-cre animals, which express Prdm14 starting at the double-positive stage of thymocyte development, do not develop disease. PRDM14-induced leukemic cells contain high levels of activated NOTCH1 and downstream NOTCH1 targets, including MYC and HES1, and are sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1 with the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Greater than 50% of human T-ALLs harbor activating mutations in NOTCH1; thus, our model carries clinically relevant molecular aberrations. The penetrance, short latency and involvement of the NOTCH1 pathway will make this hematopoietic R26PR mouse model ideal for future studies on disease initiation, relapse and novel therapeutic drug combinations. Furthermore, breeding R26PR to additional Cre lines will allow for the continued development of novel cancer models.",,"['Carofino, Brandi L', 'Ayanga, Bernard', 'Justice, Monica J']","['Carofino BL', 'Ayanga B', 'Justice MJ']","['Interdepartmental Program in Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130905,England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Prdm14 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['dmm.012575 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.012575 [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Model Mech. 2013 Nov;6(6):1494-506. doi: 10.1242/dmm.012575.

However, whether EHT initiates from a random or predetermined subpopulation of VAE, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying this process, remain unclear. We previously reported that different zebrafish stem cell leukemia (scl) isoforms are differentially required for HSC formation in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. However, the exact stage at which these isoforms impact HSC development was not defined. Here, using in vivo time-lapse imaging of scl isoform-specific reporter transgenic zebrafish lines, we show that prior to EHT scl-beta is selectively expressed in hemogenic endothelial cells, a unique subset of VAE cells possessing hemogenic potential, whereas scl-alpha is expressed later in nascent HSCs as they egress from VAE cells. In accordance with their expression, loss-of-function studies coupled with in vivo imaging analysis reveal that scl-beta acts earlier to specify hemogenic endothelium, which is later transformed by runx1 into HSCs. Our results also reveal a previously unexpected role of scl-alpha in maintaining newly born HSCs in the aorta-gonads-mesonephros. Thus, our data suggest that a defined hemogenic endothelial population preset by scl-beta supports the deterministic emergence of HSCs, and unravel the cellular mechanisms by which scl isoforms regulate HSC development.",,"['Zhen, Fenghua', 'Lan, Yahui', 'Yan, Bo', 'Zhang, Wenqing', 'Wen, Zilong']","['Zhen F', 'Lan Y', 'Yan B', 'Zhang W', 'Wen Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Center of Systems Biology and Human Health, Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, P.R.

Although initial responses to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are observed in FLT3-ITD-positive patients, subsequent relapse often occurs upon acquisition of secondary FLT3 kinase domain (KD) mutations, primarily at residues D835 and F691. Using biochemical assays, we determined that crenolanib, a novel TKI, demonstrates type I properties and is active against FLT3 containing ITD and/or D835- or F691-activating mutations. Potent activity was observed in FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell lines. Crenolanib delayed the outgrowth of MV4-11 cells in a xenograft mouse model, whereas in combination with the type II TKI sorafenib, a significant decrease in leukemic burden (P < .001) and prolonged survival (P < .01) was observed compared with either type I or II TKI alone. Crenolanib was active against Ba/F3 cells harboring FLT3-ITD and secondary KD mutations and sorafenib-resistant MOLM-13 cells containing FLT3-ITD/D835Y both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, crenolanib inhibited drug-resistant AML primary blasts with FLT3-ITD and D835H/Y mutations. These preclinical data demonstrate that crenolanib is effective against FLT3-ITD containing secondary KD mutations, suggesting that crenolanib may be a useful therapeutic agent for TKI-naive and drug-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",,"['Zimmerman, Eric I', 'Turner, David C', 'Buaboonnam, Jassada', 'Hu, Shuiying', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Roberts, Michael S', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Ramachandran, Abhijit', 'Stewart, Clinton F', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Zimmerman EI', 'Turner DC', 'Buaboonnam J', 'Hu S', 'Orwick S', 'Roberts MS', 'Janke LJ', 'Ramachandran A', 'Stewart CF', 'Inaba H', 'Baker SD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130917,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'LQF7I567TQ (crenolanib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/01/22 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36331-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-513044 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Nov 21;122(22):3607-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-513044.

Of interest, the incidence of ALL is observed approximately 20% higher in males relative to females. The mechanism behind the phenomenon of sex-specific differences is presently not understood. Employing genome-wide genetic aberration screening in 19 ALL samples, one of the most recurrent lesions identified was monoallelic deletion of the 5' region of SLX4IP. We characterized this deletion by conventional molecular genetic techniques and analyzed its interrelationships with biological and clinical characteristics using specimens and data from 993 pediatric patients enrolled into trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000. Deletion of SLX4IP was detected in approximately 30% of patients. Breakpoints within SLX4IP were defined to recurrent positions and revealed junctions with typical characteristics of illegitimate V(D)J-mediated recombination. In initial and validation analyses, SLX4IP deletions were significantly associated with male gender and ETV6/RUNX1-rearranged ALL (both overall P < 0.0001). For mechanistic validation, a second recurrent deletion affecting TAL1 and caused by the same molecular mechanism was analyzed in 1149 T-cell ALL patients. Validating a differential role by sex of illegitimate V(D)J-mediated recombination at the TAL1 locus, 128 out of 1149 T-cell ALL samples bore a deletion and males were significantly more often affected (P = 0.002). The repeatedly detected association of SLX4IP deletion with male sex and the extension of the sex bias to deletion of the TAL1 locus suggest that differential illegitimate V(D)J-mediated recombination events at specific loci may contribute to the consistent observation of higher incidence rates of childhood ALL in boys compared with girls.",,"['Meissner, Barbara', 'Bartram, Thies', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Trka, Jan', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Hermanova, Ivana', 'Ellinghaus, Eva', 'Franke, Andre', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Dorge, Petra', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate', 'Bornhauser, Beat', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Hauer, Julia', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Avigad, Smadar', 'Sokalska-Duhme, Magdalena', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Koehler, Rolf', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Stanulla, Martin']","['Meissner B', 'Bartram T', 'Eckert C', 'Trka J', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Hermanova I', 'Ellinghaus E', 'Franke A', 'Moricke A', 'Schrauder A', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Dorge P', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Basso G', 'Bartram CR', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R', 'Bornhauser B', 'Bourquin JP', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Hauer J', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Izraeli S', 'Zaliova M', 'Cario G', 'Zimmermann M', 'Avigad S', 'Sokalska-Duhme M', 'Metzler M', 'Schrappe M', 'Koehler R', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Stanulla M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130917,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinases)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SLX4IP protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (SLX4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics', 'Recombinases/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*V(D)J Recombination']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ddt447 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddt447 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2014 Feb 1;23(3):590-601. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddt447.

We have identified a family of transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase proteins as targets of hypermethylation in ALL and high-grade B cell lymphoma and demonstrated that this abnormal methylation correlates with transcript expression. PTPRG was methylated in 63% of ALL samples, PTPRK in 47%, PTPRM in 64% and PTPRO in 54% of cases, with most ALL samples containing methylation at multiple phosphatase loci. PTPRK promoter methylation was associated with a decreased overall survival in the cohort. Restoration of PTPRK transcript levels in leukaemia cells, where phosphatase transcript was silenced, reduced cell proliferation, inhibited colony formation and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy. These biological changes were associated with a reduction in levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2, Akt, STAT3 and STAT5 suggesting functional phosphatase activity after transcript re-expression. Methylation of the phosphatase promoters was reversible with decitabine and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, suggesting that PTPRK-mediated cell signalling pathways may be targeted with epigenetic therapies in lymphoid malignancy.",,"['Stevenson, W S', 'Best, O G', 'Przybylla, A', 'Chen, Q', 'Singh, N', 'Koleth, M', 'Pierce, S', 'Kennedy, T', 'Tong, W', 'Kuang, S-Q', 'Garcia-Manero, G']","['Stevenson WS', 'Best OG', 'Przybylla A', 'Chen Q', 'Singh N', 'Koleth M', 'Pierce S', 'Kennedy T', 'Tong W', 'Kuang SQ', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['1] Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Pathology North, Sydney, Australia [2] Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', '1] Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Pathology North, Sydney, Australia [2] Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Pathology North, Sydney, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Pathology North, Sydney, Australia.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Pathology North, Sydney, Australia.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130918,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013270 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.270 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):787-93. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.270.

VTD started on day 100 post ASCT; patients received four cycles of VTD (first block), were followed without treatment for 100 days and then received another four VTD cycles (second block). During this 12-month period, bisphosphonates were not administered. Best response included stringent complete remission (sCR) in 15 (35.7%) patients, complete response (CR) in 13 (30.9%), vgPR in 7 (16.6%), PR in 4 (9.5%), while 3 (7.1%) patients developed a progressive disease (PD). Importantly, 33.3% and 47.6% of patients improved their status of response after the first and second VTD block, respectively. VTD consolidation resulted in a significant reduction of circulating C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX), soluble receptor activator of the nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (sRANKL) and osteocalcin (OC), whereas bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) remained stable compared with pre-VTD values. During the study period, only one patient with a PD developed a skeletal-related event (that is, radiation to bone). The median time to progression (TTP) after ASCT was 34 months and the median time of next treatment was 40 months. We conclude that VTD consolidation post ASCT reduces bone resorption and is associated with a very low incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs) despite the absence of bisphosphonates; the later do not appear to be necessary in this context.",,"['Terpos, E', 'Christoulas, D', 'Kastritis, E', 'Roussou, M', 'Migkou, M', 'Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou, E', 'Gavriatopoulou, M', 'Gkotzamanidou, M', 'Kanellias, N', 'Manios, E', 'Papadimitriou, C', 'Dimopoulos, M A']","['Terpos E', 'Christoulas D', 'Kastritis E', 'Roussou M', 'Migkou M', 'Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou E', 'Gavriatopoulou M', 'Gkotzamanidou M', 'Kanellias N', 'Manios E', 'Papadimitriou C', 'Dimopoulos MA']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130918,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Remodeling/drug effects', 'Bone Resorption/*prevention & control', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Diphosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Serum Response Element', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013267 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.267 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):928-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.267.

METHODS: Blood from six leukaemic patients was collected into seven primary sample tubes (Monovette(R), Sarstedt): sample A, heparinized blood gas syringe (potassium reference value); sample B, plasma Li-heparin without separator gel; sample C, plasma Li-heparin with separator gel; and sample D, serum with separator gel. The primary sample tubes designated B, C and D were transported to the laboratory manually. Duplicates of the same sample tubes, B(PT), C(PT) and D(PT), were sent to the laboratory by pneumatic tube. RESULTS: In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), there was no increase in the concentration of potassium in samples B, C and D when compared to the reference value. Transport of the samples by pneumatic tube led to a pronounced increase in potassium concentration in samples B(PT) and C(PT), whereas there was no increase in sample D(PT) when compared to the reference value. In the patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), an increase in potassium concentration occurred in sample D and in samples B(PT), C(PT) and D(PT). A similar finding was observed in the patient with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), furthermore with an extremely high concentration of potassium in samples C and C(PT).

In the 1970s the natural alkaloid emetine dihydrochloride demonstrated modest anticancer efficacy as a single agent in clinical trials but this was not pursued. Groups recently reported that emetine induced apoptosis in leukemia cell lines, which was enhanced by cisplatin. We determined the antiproliferative effects of emetine with and without cisplatin in bladder cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human bladder cancer cell lines and normal human urothelial cell cultures were treated with emetine and/or cisplatin. We measured cell proliferation and evaluated synergy using the Chou-Talalay method. The combination index was calculated. Cell cycle analysis was done and caspase activation was evaluated to assess growth arrest and apoptosis. RESULTS: Emetine and cisplatin individually inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation. When combined, emetine and cisplatin acted synergistically to inhibit tumor cell proliferation with combination index values reflecting moderate to strong synergy. Normal urothelial cells were relatively resistant to this treatment. Emetine alone and combined with cisplatin appeared to primarily induce tumor cell growth arrest and not apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this study demonstrates for the first time that emetine has in vitro antiproliferative activity against bladder cancer cell lines at nanomolar concentrations but little effect on normal urothelial cells. Moreover, emetine and cisplatin worked synergistically to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Results suggest that combined emetine and cisplatin based chemotherapy may benefit patients with bladder cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and others have suggested that study design and protocol differences between the RI and other laboratories by may contribute to controversy regarding cancer hazard findings, principally findings on lymphoma/leukemia diagnoses. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate RI study design, protocol differences, and accuracy of tumor diagnoses for their impact on carcinogenic hazard characterization. METHODS: We analyzed the findings from a recent Pathology Working Group (PWG) review of RI procedures and tumor diagnoses, evaluated consistency of RI and other laboratory findings for chemicals identified by the RI as positive for lymphoma/leukemia, and examined evidence for a number of other issues raised regarding RI bioassays. The RI cancer bioassay design and protocols were evaluated in the context of relevant risk assessment guidance from international authorities. DISCUSSION: Although the PWG identified close agreement with RI diagnoses for most tumor types, it did not find close agreement for lymphoma/leukemia of the respiratory tract or for neoplasms of the inner ear and cranium. Here we discuss a) the implications of the PWG findings, particularly lymphoma diagnostic issues; b) differences between RI studies and those from other laboratories that are relevant to evaluating RI cancer bioassays; and c) future work that may help resolve some concerns. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that a) issues related to respiratory tract infections have complicated diagnoses at that site (i.e., lymphoma/leukemia), as well as for neoplasms of the inner ear and cranium, and b) there is consistency and value in RI studies for identification of other chemical-related neoplasia.",,"['Gift, Jeffrey S', 'Caldwell, Jane C', 'Jinot, Jennifer', 'Evans, Marina V', 'Cote, Ila', 'Vandenberg, John J']","['Gift JS', 'Caldwell JC', 'Jinot J', 'Evans MV', 'Cote I', 'Vandenberg JJ']","['National Center for Environmental Assessment, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130917,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Early Detection of Cancer/*methods/*standards', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Research Design/*standards', 'Risk Assessment/methods/*standards']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1306661 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2013 Nov-Dec;121(11-12):1253-63. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1306661.

The HTLV-1-encoded oncoprotein Tax induces persistent activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway, which is perceived as the primary cause of ATL. Bcl-3, a member of the NF-kappaB inhibitor (IkappaB) family, is highly expressed in many HTLV-1-infected T cell lines and ATL cells. However, the role of Bcl-3 in Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that Tax induces Bcl-3 expression, which in turn negatively regulates the Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation. Interestingly, both Bcl-3 up-regulation and NF-kappaB inhibition promote the autophagy process in HTLV-1-infected cells. Consistent with this, over-expression of Bcl-3 also results in enhancement of rapamycin-, pifithrin-alpha- or starvation-induced autophagy in control cells.

However, how their activity is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we unravel a novel mechanism of regulation of a CRL5 through phosphorylation of its specificity subunit ASB2alpha. Indeed, using mass spectrometry, we showed for the first time that ASB2alpha is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation of serine-323 (Ser-323) of ASB2alpha is crucial for the targeting of the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNa) to degradation. Mutation of ASB2alpha Ser-323 to Ala had no effect on intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of ASB2alpha but abolished the ability of ASB2alpha to induce degradation of FLNa. In contrast, the ASB2alpha Ser-323 to Asp phosphomimetic mutant induced acute degradation of FLNa. Moreover, inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) activity reduced ASB2alpha-mediated FLNa degradation. We further showed that the subcellular localization of ASB2alpha to actin-rich structures is dependent on ASB2alpha Ser-323 phosphorylation and propose that the interaction with FLNa depends on the electrostatic potential redistribution induced by the Ser-323 phosphate group. Taken together, these data unravel an important mechanism by which ASB2alpha-mediated FLNa degradation can be regulated.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Zakaria, Rim', 'Lamsoul, Isabelle', 'Uttenweiler-Joseph, Sandrine', 'Erard, Monique', 'Monsarrat, Bernard', 'Burlet-Schiltz, Odile', 'Moog-Lutz, Christel', 'Lutz, Pierre G']","['Zakaria R', 'Lamsoul I', 'Uttenweiler-Joseph S', 'Erard M', 'Monsarrat B', 'Burlet-Schiltz O', 'Moog-Lutz C', 'Lutz PG']","['CNRS; IPBS (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale), 205 route de Narbonne BP 64182, F-31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, UPS, IPBS, F-31077 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130915,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (ASB2 protein, human)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Filamins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proteolysis', 'Serine/analysis/*metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'APL', 'AR', 'ASB', 'CID', 'CRL5', 'Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase', 'E3', 'E3 ubiquitin ligase', 'ETD', 'Erk', 'FLN', 'Filamin', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Post-translational modifications', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'ankyrin repeat', 'collision-induced dissociation', 'cullin5-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases', 'electron transfer dissociation', 'extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'filamin']",2013/09/21 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00291-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Dec;25(12):2823-30. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.09.011.

The disease follows a benign course in most patients with cutaneous and indolent systemic mastocytosis (SM); however, advanced variants associated with decreased life expectancy also exist.

The literature discussed was retrieved with PubMed using the search terms 'treatment of mastocytosis,' 'mastocytosis antimediator therapy' and looking for important cross-references.

Cytoreductive therapies are generally reserved for patients with aggressive mastocytosis (ASM), MC leukemia (MCL) and MC sarcoma (MCS); however, some patients with indolent disease and recurrent anaphylactic episodes not responsive to antimediator therapies may also be considered for cytoreduction on a case-by-case basis.",,"['Cardet, Juan Carlos', 'Akin, Cem', 'Lee, Min Jung']","['Cardet JC', 'Akin C', 'Lee MJ']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, Immunology, Mastocytosis Center, Department of Medicine , One Jimmy Fund Way, Smith Building, Room 626B, Boston, MA 02115 , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Mastocytosis/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,,2013/09/21 06:00,2014/04/04 06:00,['2013/09/19 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2013.824424 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2013 Oct;14(15):2033-45. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2013.824424.,PMC4362676,,['T32 AI007306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS667896'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulator of pulmonary Th2 inflammation, but the underlying mechanism and the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process have not been defined. Here we show that lung-specific overexpression of VEGF decreases miR-1 expression in the lung, most prominently in the endothelium, and a similar down-regulation occurs in lung endothelium in Th2 inflammation models. Intranasal delivery of miR-1 inhibited inflammatory responses to ovalbumin, house dust mite, and IL-13 overexpression. Blocking VEGF inhibited Th2-mediated lung inflammation, and this was restored by antagonizing miR-1. Using mRNA arrays, Argonaute pull-down assays, luciferase expression assays, and mutational analysis, we identified Mpl as a direct target of miR-1 and showed that VEGF controls the expression of endothelial Mpl during Th2 inflammation via the regulation of miR-1. In vivo knockdown of Mpl inhibited Th2 inflammation and indirectly inhibited the expression of P-selectin in lung endothelium. These experiments define a novel VEGF-miR-1-Mpl-P-selectin effector pathway in lung Th2 inflammation and herald the utility of miR-1 and Mpl as potential therapeutic targets for asthma.",,"['Takyar, Seyedtaghi', 'Vasavada, Hema', 'Zhang, Jian-ge', 'Ahangari, Farida', 'Niu, Naiqian', 'Liu, Qing', 'Lee, Chun Geun', 'Cohn, Lauren', 'Elias, Jack A']","['Takyar S', 'Vasavada H', 'Zhang JG', 'Ahangari F', 'Niu N', 'Liu Q', 'Lee CG', 'Cohn L', 'Elias JA']","['Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130916,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn1 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Endothelium/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lung/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'P-Selectin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pneumonia/*genetics/*immunology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/09/18 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/09/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20121200 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20121200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2013 Sep 23;210(10):1993-2010. doi: 10.1084/jem.20121200.

Some KIR2DL1 alleles encode receptors that have stronger signaling function than others. We tested the hypothesis that the clinical outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) could be affected by donor KIR2DL1 polymorphism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 313 pediatric patients received allogeneic HSCT at a single institution. Donor KIR2DL1 functional allele typing was retrospectively performed using single nucleotide polymorphism assay. RESULTS: Patients who received a donor graft containing the functionally stronger KIR2DL1 allele with arginine at amino acid position 245 (KIR2DL1-R(245)) had better survival (P = .0004) and lower cumulative incidence of disease progression (P = .001) than those patients who received a donor graft that contained only the functionally weaker KIR2DL1 allele with cysteine at the same position (KIR2DL1-C(245)). The effect of KIR2DL1 allelic polymorphism was similar in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia among all allele groups (P >/= .71). Patients who received a KIR2DL1-R(245)-positive graft with HLA-C receptor-ligand mismatch had the best survival (P = .00003) and lowest risk of leukemia progression (P = .0005) compared with those who received a KIR2DL1-C(245) homozygous graft. CONCLUSION: Donor KIR2DL1 allelic polymorphism affects recipient outcomes after allogeneic HSCT. These findings have substantial implications for prognostication and donor selection.,,"['Bari, Rafijul', 'Rujkijyanont, Piya', 'Sullivan, Erin', 'Kang, Guolian', 'Turner, Victoria', 'Gan, Kwan', 'Leung, Wing']","['Bari R', 'Rujkijyanont P', 'Sullivan E', 'Kang G', 'Turner V', 'Gan K', 'Leung W']","[""Rafijul Bari, Piya Rujkijyanont, Erin Sullivan, Guolian Kang, Victoria Turner, Kwan Gan, Wing Leung, St Jude Children's Research Hospital; Wing Leung, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130916,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (KIR2DL1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL1)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arginine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cysteine', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HLA-C Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*surgery', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*surgery', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2013/09/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.47.4007 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.47.4007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Oct 20;31(30):3782-90. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.47.4007.

We hypothesized that an unbiased analysis of (S)G-induced perturbation of the entire proteome might uncover novel mechanism(s) of action of the drug. We performed a quantitative assessment of global protein expression in control and (S)G-treated Jurkat T cells by employing stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.

Two major isoforms of TCL1 Protooncogenes (TCL1 and TCL1b) are present adjacent to each other on human chromosome 14q.32. In human T-PLL, both TCL1 and TCL1b are activated by chromosomal translocation. Moreover, TCL1b-transgenic mice have never been created. Therefore, it remains unclear whether TCL1b itself, independent of TCL1, exhibits oncogenicity. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, both ectopic and endogenous TCL1b interacted with Akt. In in vitro Akt kinase assays, TCL1b enhanced Akt kinase activity in dose- and time-dependent manners. Bioinformatics approaches utilizing multiregression analysis, cluster analysis, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway mapping, Venn diagrams and Gene Ontology (GO) demonstrated that TCL1b showed highly homologous gene-induction signatures similar to Myr-Akt or TCL1. TCL1b exhibited oncogenicity in in vitro colony-transformation assay. Further, two independent lines of beta-actin promoter-driven TCL1b-transgenic mice developed angiosarcoma on the intestinal tract. Angiosarcoma is a rare form of cancer in humans with poor prognosis. Using immunohistochemistry, 11 out of 13 human angiosarcoma samples were positively stained with both anti-TCL1b and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. Consistently, in various cancer tissues, 69 out of 146 samples were positively stained with anti-TCL1b, out of which 46 were positively stained with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. Moreover, TCL1b structure-based inhibitor 'TCL1b-Akt-in' inhibited Akt kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)-induced Akt kinase activities-in turn, 'TCL1b-Akt-in' inhibited cellular proliferation of sarcoma.

Constitutive classical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) activation protects CLL B-cells from cell death and plays a critical role in the acquisition of chemoresistance. RelB, representing the alternative NF-kappaB activity, functions specifically in lymphoid organogenesis and B-cell maturation. RelB indeed plays a tumor-supportive role and confers radiation resistance in tumors. However, the involvement of RelB in CLL has not been addressed. Here, we analyzed the NF-kappaB activation in 67 of CLL bone marrow (BM). Both the RelA and RelB activity were detected in CLL B-cells from BM, in spite of inevitable variability. Low RelB activity was linked to a favorable prognosis of CLL. The migration and adhesion abilities of CLL B-cells were not affected by the RelB activity. High RelB activity, together with the RelA activity, maintained basal survival of cells. The induction of RelA and RelB expression in the nucleus was responsible for better survival of CLL B-cells supported by bone marrow stromal cells. In addition, the presence of high RelB activity in CLL B-cells was correlated with sensitivity to proteasome inhibitor but not fludarabine. Taken together, we provided evidences that not only RelA but also RelB, subunits of NF-kappaB family, played an important role in the cellular behaviors of CLL cells from BM. The strength of RelB activity influenced the prognosis of CLL patients. KEY MESSAGE: RelB, with RelA activity, maintained the basal survival of CLL cells from BM. RelB, with RelA, conferred the proteasome inhibitor sensitivity of CLL cells. Induction of RelA and RelB was responsible for the better survival of CLL B-cells.

Findings in schoolchildren and chronic pain samples indicate that increased parental distress may increase parental protective, pain-attending behavior, which is associated with more child pain and distress. However, in the context of invasive medical procedures, it is unknown which parents are likely to become most distressed and engage in pain-attending behavior, and how this impacts the children's experiences. The present study investigated the impact of parental catastrophic thoughts upon parental distress and pain-attending behavior (verbal and nonverbal). Furthermore, the association between parental responses and the children's pain behavior, pain, and distress was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 46 parents of children with leukemia (range, 0.6 to 15 y) who underwent a LP/BMA procedure participated in this study. Parental catastrophizing was assessed before and parental and child distress was assessed after the LP/BMA procedure. Parental pain-attending behavior and the child's pain behavior were observed before and after the LP/BMA procedure. RESULTS: Findings indicated that heightened parental catastrophic thinking contributed to increased parental distress during LP/BMA and less pain-attending behavior before the LP/BMA procedure, especially in young children. In contrast, heightened distress in parents with high levels of catastrophizing contributed to increased engagement in postprocedural pain-attending behavior. For young children, increased preprocedural pain-attending behavior was related to more child distress, pain, and pain behavior.

Here we demonstrate that OSU-A9, an I3C derivative with improved anticancer potency, induces cytotoxicity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1) and primary leukemia cells from AML patients in a dose-responsive manner. Normal human bone marrow cells were less sensitive to OSU-A9 than leukemia cells. OSU-A9 induces caspase activation, PARP cleavage, and autophagy but not autophagic cell death. Interestingly, pretreatment of AML cell lines and primary AML cells with N-acetylcysteine or glutathione rescues them from apoptosis (and concomitant PARP cleavage) and Akt hypophosphorylation, implicating a key role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in OSU-A9-related cytotoxicity. Importantly, the anticancer utility of OSU-A9 is extended in vivo as it, administered intraperitoneally, suppresses the growth of THP-1 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice without obvious toxicity. This study shows that ROS-mediated apoptosis contributes to the anticancer activity of OSU-A9 in AML cell lines and primary AML cells, and thus should be considered in the future assessment of its translational value in AML therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has demonstrated clinical efficacy in leukemia and in vitro activity in various solid tumors. This study was conducted to determine the in vitro and in vivo combination effects of ATO and chemotherapy in SCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro model consisted of 5 SCLC cell lines (H187, H526, H69, H841 and DMS79) and the anti-proliferative effects of ATO, cisplatin, etoposide or combinations thereof were measured. Synergism was determined by calculation of the combination index (CI) according to Chou and Talalay. Assays for apoptosis, intracellular glutathione (GSH) content, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization (MMD) were performed. Arsenic content was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Expression level of MRP1, MRP2 and pH2AX was detected by Western blot while cellular pH2AX level was monitored by immunofluorescent staining. An in vivo xenograft model in nude mice was established with a H841 cell line to test the effects of drug combinations. RESULTS: All 5 SCLC cell lines were sensitive to ATO, with IC(50) values (48 h) 1.6-8 muM. Synergistic or additive effects were obtained by combining cisplatin with ATO in all 5 cell lines. Combination of etoposide with ATO resulted in antagonistic or barely additive effects. Apoptotic assays and pH2AX immunofluorescent staining corroborated the synergistic combination of ATO and cisplatin. In addition, the ATO/cisplatin combination enhanced MMD, depleted GSH, downregulated MRP2 and elevated intracellular ATO content compared with either ATO or cisplatin alone. In vivo combination of ATO and cisplatin also demonstrated synergism in the H841 xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: There was clinically relevant in vitro activity of ATO in a panel of 5 SCLC cell lines. Significant synergism was demonstrated with the ATO/cisplatin combination, while antagonism was noted with the ATO/etoposide combination in both in vitro and in vivo models.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We therefore investigated the role of TNF-alpha and found that it supports survival of CML SPCs by promoting nuclear factor kappaB/p65 pathway activity and expression of the interleukin 3 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor common beta-chain receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in CML SPCs, inhibition of autocrine TNF-alpha signaling via a small-molecule TNF-alpha inhibitor induces apoptosis.

The studies in this review have used whole-genome, exome, and transcriptome sequencing to identify recurring structural genetic alterations and sequence mutations that target key cellular pathways in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the lymphomas. Although each tumor type is characterized by a unique genomic landscape, several cellular pathways are mutated in multiple tumor types-transcriptional regulation of differentiation, antigen receptor signaling, tyrosine kinase and Ras signaling, and epigenetic modifications-and individual genes are mutated in multiple tumors, notably TCF3, NOTCH1, MYD88, and BRAF. In addition to providing fundamental insights into tumorigenesis, these studies have also identified potential new markers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutic intervention. Several genetic alterations are intuitively ""druggable"" with existing agents, for example, kinase-activating lesions in high-risk B-cell ALL, NOTCH1 in both leukemia and lymphoma, and BRAF in hairy cell leukemia.

CD4(+) T cells were isolated from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carrier (HAC) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients in order to identify genes involved in HAM/TSP development using a microarray technique. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that healthy control (CT) and HTLV-1-infected samples clustered separately.

Licensing of these alternative treatments was based on randomized controlled trials assessing complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months as primary end points. We use this case study to illustrate the validation of CCyR and MMR as surrogate outcomes for overall survival in CML and how this evidence was used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's recommendation on the public funding of these first-line treatments for CML. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association between CCyR and MMR at 12 months and overall survival in patients with chronic phase CML. We estimated life expectancy by extrapolating long-term survival from the weighted overall survival stratified according to the achievement of CCyR and MMR. RESULTS: Five studies provided data on the observational association between CCyR or MMR and overall survival. Based on the pooled association between CCyR and MMR and overall survival, our modeling showed comparable predicted mean duration of survival (21-23 years) following first-line treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. CONCLUSIONS: This case study illustrates the consideration of surrogate outcome evidence in health technology assessment.

The recently updated indications by the European Leukemia Network include advanced-phase CML and nonresponders to second-line TKIs. Changes in transplant programs, over the past decade, have resulted in a significant reduction in transplant related mortality and this has expanded the transplant option to older patients, who may be eligible for SCT. Transplantation for blastic phase CML remains a challenge due to the high rate of post-transplant relapses. Thus, in view of this issue, several studies of TKIs after allogeneic SCT have been undertaken with encouraging results.

Arg. root possesses anti-leukaemic activity.,157,10.1186/1752-153X-7-157 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Mallotus philippensis (Lam.) Muell. Arg. is a well known medicinal plant of Asia and Australia. Various compounds from different aerial parts of the plant have been reported possessing potent pharmacological, antiviral, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. We were interested to determine the effects of some root extracts from M. philippensis on human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell proliferation, cell cycle regulators and apoptosis in order to investigate its anti-leukemic potential. RESULTS: Root extract of M. philippensis was initially extracted in organic solvents, hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The hexane extract showed highest toxicity against p53-deficient HL-60 cells (IC50 1.5 mg dry roots equivalent/ml medium) after 72 h and interestingly, inhibition of cell proliferation was preceded by the upregulation of the proto-oncogenes Cdc25A and cyclin D1 within 24 h. The hexane extract induced 18% apoptosis after 48 h of treatment. Chemical composition of the hexane extract was analyzed by GC-MS and the 90% fragments were matched with polyphenolic compounds. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that the hexane fraction of M. philippensis root extract possesses anti-leukemic activity in HL-60 cells. The polyphenols were the main compounds of the hexane extract that inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis.",,"['Khan, Musa', 'Qureshi, Rizwana Aleem', 'Hussain, Masroor', 'Mehmood, Khalid', 'Khan, Rahmat Ali']","['Khan M', 'Qureshi RA', 'Hussain M', 'Mehmood K', 'Khan RA']","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology Bannu, Bannu, Pakistan.

Marked diversities with regard to molecular biology and clinical features are recognized in different subsets of the two lymphomas. Because these differences could be related to the location of the lymphoma, it is of interest to investigate the clinical and histopathological features of DLBCL and MCL involving the ocular adnexal region (i.e. the orbit, eyelids, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland and lacrimal sac). Similarly, the lacrimal gland is the only glandular structure within the orbit. Because the lacrimal gland represents an important part of the immunological system, it is of interest to investigate lymphomas involving this location with regard to clinical and histological characteristics. PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical and histopathological features of Danish patients with DLBCL of the ocular adnexal region between 1980 and 2009 and of Danish ocular adnexal MCL patients from 1980 to 2005. Furthermore, the aim of this PhD was to review all specimens from patients with lymphoma of the lacrimal gland in Denmark between 1975 and 2009 to determine the distribution of lymphoma subtypes of the lacrimal gland and to describe the clinicopathological features of these patients. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients with DLBCL and 21 with MCL of the ocular adnexal region were identified. Twenty-seven patients had lacrimal gland lymphoma, including four DLBCLs and three MCLs from studies I and II. Elderly patients predominated in all three groups, with median ages of 78, 75 and 69 years in the DLBCL, the MCL and the lacrimal gland lymphoma groups, respectively. MCL patients had a preponderance of males, whereas females prevailed among lacrimal gland lymphoma patients. The orbit was the most common site of involvement in DLBCL and MCL. Most DLBCL patients had unilateral involvement, while MCL patients had a high frequency of bilateral involvement. Similarly, localized lymphoma was relatively frequently seen in DLBCL patients in contrast to the predominance of disseminated lymphoma in the MCL group. The majority of lacrimal gland lymphomas were low grade, and the distribution of subtypes was as follows: extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, 10 (37%); follicular lymphoma, 5 (19%); DLBCL, 4 (15%); MCL, 3 (11%); chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphatic lymphoma, 2 (7%); and unclassified B-cell lymphoma, 3 (11%). The overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years for the entire study group of DLBCL were 42% and 20%, whereas 58% and 22% of MCL patients were alive 3 and 5 years after the time of diagnosis. The 5-year overall survival rate of lacrimal gland lymphoma patients was 70%. Concordant bone marrow involvement and the International Prognostic Index score were predictive factors for the overall survival in the DLBCL group in Cox regression analysis. Rituximab-containing chemotherapy was associated with an improved survival rate in MCL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and MCL involving the ocular adnexal region and lymphoma of the lacrimal gland are prevalent among elderly patients. The overall prognosis in DLBCL and MCL was poor, whereas the prognosis for lacrimal gland lymphoma patients was relatively good. Concordant bone marrow involvement and the International Prognostic Index score were independent predictive factors for mortality in the DLBCL group. Chemotherapy containing rituximab significantly improved survival in the MCL group.",['(c) 2013 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.'],"['Rasmussen, Peter Kristian']",['Rasmussen PK'],"['Eye Pathology Institute, Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lacrimal Apparatus/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Orbital Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'lacrimal gland lymphoma', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'ocular adnexal region', 'prognosis', 'treatment.']",2013/09/18 06:00,2014/04/29 06:00,['2013/09/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/aos.12189 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2013 Jul;91 Thesis 5:1-27. doi: 10.1111/aos.12189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, previous published data on the association between RAD51 135G>C polymorphism and cancer risk remained controversial. Recent meta-analysis only analyzed RAD51 135G>C polymorphism with breast cancer risk, but the results were also inconsistent. METHODS: A meta-analysis based on 39 case-control studies was performed to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and RAD51 135G>C. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association in different inheritance models. Heterogeneity among studies was tested and sensitivity analysis was applied. RESULTS: Overall, no significant association was found between RAD51 135G>C polymorphism and cancer susceptibility in any genetic model. In further stratified analysis, significantly elevated breast cancer risk was observed in BRCA2 mutation carriers (recessive model: OR = 4.88, 95% CI = 1.10-21.67; additive model: OR = 4.92, 95% CI = 1.11-21.83). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that RAD51 variant 135C homozygote is associated with elevated breast cancer risk among BRCA2 mutation carriers. Moreover, our work also points out the importance of new studies for RAD51 135G>C association in acute myeloid leukemia, especially in Caucasians, where at least some of the covariates responsible for heterogeneity could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the RAD51 135G>C polymorphism in cancer development.",,"['Wang, Wei', 'Li, Jia-Lin', 'He, Xiao-Feng', 'Li, An-Ping', 'Cai, Yong-Lin', 'Xu, Na', 'Sun, Shu-Mei', 'Wu, Bing-Yi']","['Wang W', 'Li JL', 'He XF', 'Li AP', 'Cai YL', 'Xu N', 'Sun SM', 'Wu BY']","['Shanxi Zhendong Pharmaceutical Co.

However, toxicity of formaldehyde in bone marrow, the target site of leukemia induction, is still poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate bone marrow toxicity (bone marrow pathology, hematotoxicity) and underlying mechanisms (oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis) in formaldehyde-exposed mice. Male Balb/c mice were exposed to formaldehyde (0, 0.5, and 3.0 mg/m(3)) by nose-only inhalation for 8 hours/day, over a two week period designed to simulate a factory work schedule, with an exposure-free ""weekend"" on days 6 and 7, and were sacrificed on the morning of day 13.

However, the cytotoxic potentials of native dihydroceramides have not been defined. Therefore, we determined the cytotoxic effects of increasing dihydroceramide levels via de novo synthesis in T-cell ALL cell lines and whether such cytotoxicity was dependent on an absolute increase in total dihydroceramide mass versus an increase of certain specific dihydroceramides. A novel method employing supplementation of individual fatty acids, sphinganine, and the dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES) inhibitor, GT-11, was used to increase de novo dihydroceramide synthesis and absolute levels of specific dihydroceramides and ceramides. Sphingolipidomic analyses of four T-cell ALL cell lines revealed strong positive correlations between cytotoxicity and levels of C22:0-dihydroceramide (rho = 0.74-0.81, P </= 0.04) and C24:0-dihydroceramide (rho = 0.84-0.90, P </= 0.004), but not between total or other individual dihydroceramides, ceramides, or sphingoid bases or phosphorylated derivatives. Selective increase of C22:0- and C24:0-dihydroceramide increased level and flux of autophagy marker, LC3B-II, and increased DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay) in the absence of an increase of reactive oxygen species; pan-caspase inhibition blocked DNA fragmentation but not cell death. C22:0-fatty acid supplemented to 4-HPR treated cells further increased C22:0-dihydroceramide levels (P </= 0.001) and cytotoxicity (P </= 0.001). These data demonstrate that increases of specific dihydroceramides are cytotoxic to T-cell ALL cells by a caspase-independent, mixed cell death mechanism associated with increased autophagy and suggest that dihydroceramides may contribute to 4-HPR-induced cytotoxicity.

Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of FLT3 is present in a third of AML cases, results in constitutive activation and aberrant signaling of FLT3, and is associated with adverse treatment outcomes. While wild-type (WT) FLT3 is predominantly a 150 kDa complex glycosylated cell surface protein, FLT3-ITD is partially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as a 130 kDa underglycosylated species associated with the chaperones calnexin and heat shock protein (HSP) 90, and mediates aberrant STAT5 signaling, which upregulates the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase Pim-1. FLT3 contains a Pim-1 substrate consensus serine phosphorylation site, and we hypothesized that it might be a Pim-1 substrate. Pim-1 was indeed found to directly interact with and serine-phosphorylate FLT3. Pim-1 inhibition decreased the expression and half-life of 130 kDa FLT3, with partial abrogation by proteasome inhibition, in association with decreased FLT3 binding to calnexin and HSP90, and increased 150 kDa FLT3 expression and half-life, with abrogation by inhibition of glycosylation. These findings were consistent with Pim-1 stabilizing FLT3-ITD as a 130 kDa species associated with calnexin and HSP90 and inhibiting its glycosylation to form the 150 kDa species. Pim-1 knockdown effects were similar. Pim-1 inhibition also decreased phosphorylation of FLT3 at tyrosine 591 and of STAT5, and expression of Pim-1 itself, consistent with inhibition of the FLT3-ITD-STAT5 signaling pathway.

The objective of this study was to describe reasons for failure to provide HRQL assessments during a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clinical trial. METHODS: We focused on HRQL assessments embedded in a multicenter pediatric AML clinical trial. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales, PedsQL 3.0 Acute Cancer Module, PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and Pediatric Inventory for Parents were obtained from parent/guardian respondents at a maximum of six time points. Children provided self-report optionally. A central study coordinator contacted sites with delinquent HRQL data. Reasons for failure to submit the HRQL assessments were evaluated by three pediatric oncologists and themes were generated using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There were 906 completed and 1091 potential assessments included in this analysis (83%). The median age of included children was 12.9 years (range 2.0 to 18.9). The five themes for non-completion were: patient too ill; passive or active refusal by respondent; developmental delay; logistical challenges; and poor knowledge of study processes from both the respondent and institutional perspective. CONCLUSIONS: We identified reasons for non-completion of HRQL assessments during active therapy.

To investigate the clinical characteristics and outcome of this subtype in Chinese population, we systemically reviewed 62 patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL, including 15 patients with SIL-TAL1 rearrangement. We found that SIL-TAL1(+) T-ALL was characterized by higher white blood cell count (P = 0.029) at diagnosis, predominant cortical T-ALL immunophenotype (P = 0.028) of the leukemic blasts, and a higher prevalence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS, P<0.001) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, P<0.001), which led to a higher early mortality (P = 0.011). Compared with SIL-TAL1(-) patients, SIL-TAL1(+) patients had shorter relapse free survival (P = 0.007) and overall survival (P = 0.002). Our NOD/SCID xenotransplantation model also demonstrated that SIL-TAL1(+) mice models had earlier disease onset, higher leukemia cell load in peripheral blood and shorter overall survival (P<0.001).

The aim of the study is to optimize the oxidative stress -induced chronic myeloid leukemic (CML) cell death by combining glutathione synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) with HCH and studying the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-proliferative activity of BSO and HCH alone or in combination against a number of leukemic (K562, KCL22, KU812, U937, Molt4), non-leukemic (A549, MIA-PaCa2, PC-3, HepG2) cancer cell lines and normal cell lines (NIH3T3, Vero) was measured by MTT assay. Apoptotic activity in CML cell line K562 was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) after staining with annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI), detection of reduced mitochondrial membrane potential after staining with JC-1, cleavage of caspase- 3 and poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase proteins by western blot analysis and translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) by confocal microscopy. Intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) was measured by colorimetric assay using GSH assay kit. 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) were used as probes to measure intracellular increase in ROS and nitric oxide (NO) levels respectively. Multiple techniques like siRNA transfection and pharmacological inhibition were used to understand the mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Non-apoptotic concentrations of BSO significantly potentiated HCH-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. BSO potentiated apoptosis-inducing activity of HCH in CML cells by caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent but apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)-dependent manner. Enhanced depletion of intracellular GSH induced by combined treatment correlated with induction of ROS. Activation of ROS- dependent JNK played a crucial role in ERK1/2 activation which subsequently induced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS- mediated production of NO was identified as an effector molecule causing apoptosis of CML cells.

Our results indicate that GB exhibits selective anti-proliferative activity on a panel of leukemia/lymphoma cells in comparison to non-cancerous cells. Specifically, GB disrupted the cell-cycle progression within BJAB cells, as manifested by G2/M phase arrest and DNA fragmentation, and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation to the outer cytoplasmic membrane in two B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. The pro-apoptotic effect of GB was found to be independent of mitochondrial depolarization, thus implicating extrinsic cell death pathways to exert its cytotoxicity. Indeed, GB elicited an increase of TNF-alpha production, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, and PARP-1 cleavage within pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia Nalm-6 cells. Moreover, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage were strongly inhibited/blocked by the addition of the specific caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and Ac-DEVD-CHO. Furthermore, intracellular signaling analyses determined that GB treatment enhanced constitutive activation of Lck and Src tyrosine kinases in Nalm-6 cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that GB induced preferential anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic signals within B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cells, as determined by the following biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis: PS externalization, enhanced release of TNF-alpha, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, PARP-1 cleavage and DNA fragmentation Our observations reveal that GB has potential as an anti-leukemia/lymphoma agent alone or in combination with standard cancer therapies and thus warrants further evaluation in vivo to support these findings.",,"['Robles-Escajeda, Elisa', 'Lerma, Dennise', 'Nyakeriga, Alice M', 'Ross, Jeremy A', 'Kirken, Robert A', 'Aguilera, Renato J', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando']","['Robles-Escajeda E', 'Lerma D', 'Nyakeriga AM', 'Ross JA', 'Kirken RA', 'Aguilera RJ', 'Varela-Ramirez A']","['Department of Biological Sciences and Border Biomedical Research Center, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130909,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Hordeum/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",,,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/06/08 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0073508 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-13400 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Sep 9;8(9):e73508. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0073508. eCollection 2013.,PMC3767772,,"['1SC3GM103713-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'SC3 GM103713/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '8G12MD007592/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P20MD002287-06/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM069621/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 MD007592/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R25GM069621-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 MD002287/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As regular green tea consumption has been associated with improved prognosis of breast cancer patients, including decreased risk of recurrence, here the effects of the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) were tested on two IBC lines: SUM-149 and SUM-190. EGCG decreased expression of genes that promote proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival. Consistently, growth, invasive properties, and survival of IBC cells were reduced by EGCG treatment. EGCG also reduced lymphangiogenesis-promoting genes, in particular VEGF-D. Conditioned media from EGCG-treated IBC cells displayed decreased VEGF-D secretion and reduced ability to promote lymphangiogenesis in vitro as measured by hTERT-HDLEC lymphatic endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Tumorsphere formation by SUM-149 cells was robustly inhibited by EGCG, suggesting effects on self-renewal ability. Stem-like SUM-149 cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, previously implicated in poor patient prognosis, were isolated. EGCG treatment reduced growth and induced apoptosis of the stem-like SUM-149 cells in culture. In an orthotopic mouse model, EGCG decreased growth of pre-existing tumors derived from ALDH-positive stem-like SUM-149 cells and their expression of VEGF-D, which correlated with a significant decrease in peritumoral lymphatic vessel density. Thus, EGCG inhibits the overall aggressive IBC phenotype. Reduction of the stem-like cell compartment by EGCG may explain the decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence among green tea drinkers. Recent clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of green tea polyphenol extracts in treatment of prostate cancer and lymphocytic leukemia with low toxicity. Given the poor prognosis of IBC patients, our findings suggest further exploration of EGCG or green tea in combinatorial treatments against active IBC disease or in maintenance regimens to avoid recurrence is warranted.",,"['Mineva, Nora D', 'Paulson, K Eric', 'Naber, Stephen P', 'Yee, Amy S', 'Sonenshein, Gail E']","['Mineva ND', 'Paulson KE', 'Naber SP', 'Yee AS', 'Sonenshein GE']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130911,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Breast/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphangiogenesis/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D/metabolism']",,,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/06/08 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0073464 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-15364 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Sep 11;8(9):e73464. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0073464. eCollection 2013.,PMC3770659,,"['P01 ES011624/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the function of IRS4 is not well understood. IRS4 overexpression has been associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and subungual exostosis, while point mutations of IRS4 have been found in melanomas. Here, we show that while IRS4 expression is low in most cancer cell lines, IRS4 mRNA and protein levels are markedly elevated in certain cells including the NCI-H720, DMS114, HEK293T and HEK293AAV lines. Surprisingly, IRS4 expression was also strongly induced when HEK293 cells were infected with retroviral particles and selected under puromycin, making IRS4 expression a potential off-target effect of retroviral expression vectors. Cells with high expression of IRS4 displayed high phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) levels, as well as elevated Akt and p70 S6 kinase activities, even in the absence of growth factors. PI 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling in these cells depends on IRS4, even though these cells also express IRS1/2. Knockdown of IRS4 also inhibited cell proliferation in cells with high levels of IRS4.

Additionally, histopathological studies, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were also performed. Our results indicated that NCPB treatment after PH improved liver regeneration and survival rates, increased hepatic blood flow, reduced hepatocyte damage, decreased the secretion and release of inflammatory cytokines, increased the expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax). Additionally, Western blotting revealed that the expression of NF-kappaB p65 and c-Jun were decreased in liver after NCPB.

Less is known about the quality of the recorded data. OBJECTIVE: To describe the present coverage of the DNLR, its completeness, and accuracy of individual variables for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, as a second measure of true coverage of the DNLR, to estimate AML incidence in Denmark from DNLR data and compare it to incidence reported from other AML registries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: By the end of December 2011, the DNLR (established January 2000) included detailed data on a large, well-defined, and nonselected Danish population of 2,665 AML patients. We estimated positive predictive values (PPVs) and completeness for 30 variables, which included patient and disease characteristics, treatment, and treatment outcomes. We identified 260 AML patients (10% of all AML patients recorded in the DNLR). We used information from medical records as the gold standard. RESULTS: Using the Danish National Registry of Patients as a reference, the coverage of the DNLR was 99.6%. The PPVs of the individual variables ranged from 89.4% to 100%. The completeness of individual variables varied between 60.7% and 100%. Stratification by time of registration in the DNLR (before 2006 versus 2006 and later) revealed higher PPVs and lower frequencies of missing data from 2006. Sex-adjusted incidence rates were 6.2/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval 5.8-6.6) in males and 4.9/100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval 4.5-5.4) in females. Yearly incidence rates of AML were higher than the incidence rates reported from Sweden (4.5 and 4.2/100,000) and the US (4.5 and 3.1/100,000 in Caucasians). CONCLUSION: With few exceptions, there were high values for PPVs and completeness of recorded data. Data accuracy and completeness have improved since the registry was established. The estimated incidence may indicate that the DNLR truly is more complete than other registries. In conclusion, the DNLR is a valuable resource for clinical research of AML.",,"['Ostgard, Lene Sofie Granfeldt', 'Norgaard, Jan Maxwell', 'Severinsen, Marianne Tang', 'Sengelov, Henrik', 'Friis, Lone', 'Jensen, Morten Krogh', 'Nielsen, Ove Juul', 'Norgaard, Mette']","['Ostgard LS', 'Norgaard JM', 'Severinsen MT', 'Sengelov H', 'Friis L', 'Jensen MK', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Norgaard M']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark ; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130902,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'incidence', 'registration completeness', 'validation studies']",2013/09/17 06:00,2013/09/17 06:01,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S48411 [doi]', 'clep-5-335 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2013 Sep 2;5:335-44. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S48411. eCollection 2013.,PMC3770716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the hydration is commonly initiated 4 hours before start of the methotrexate (MTX) infusion. To test if longer duration of prehydration would prevent MTX-induced renal toxicity, we preformed a randomized cross-over study comparing 12-4 hours of hydration before the infusion of HDMTX. PROCEDURES: Children with ALL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma that were treated with infusions of HDMTX 5 or 8 g/m(2) were randomized to receive intravenous prehydration 12 or 4 hours before the first HDMTX infusion. Patients alternated between 12 and 4 hours of prehydration in the subsequent HDMTX infusions. Renal toxicity was defined as 50% increase in plasma creatinine after the HDMTX infusion. The plasma MTX concentration was measured during and after the HDMTX infusion to determine if the duration of prehydration would influence the systemic MTX clearance. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (224 HDMTX infusions) with a median age of 4.9 years were included in the study. The duration of prehydration had no effect on MTX induced renal toxicity that occurred in 18.5% of all HDMTX 5 g/m(2) infusions and in 40.0% of all HDMTX 8 g/m(2) infusions. Similar the duration of prehydration had no impact on the systemic clearance of MTX. CONCLUSION: Extending prehydration beyond 4 hours does not reduce the risk of renal toxicity or delayed MTX clearance after infusions with HDMTX 5-8 g/m(2).","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mikkelsen, Torben Stamm', 'Mamoudou, Aissata Diop', 'Tuckuviene, Ruta', 'Wehner, Peder Skov', 'Schroeder, Henrik']","['Mikkelsen TS', 'Mamoudou AD', 'Tuckuviene R', 'Wehner PS', 'Schroeder H']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20130903,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Female', '*Fluid Therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['drug clearance', 'hydration', 'methotrexate', 'nephrotoxicity', 'pharmacokinetics']",2013/09/17 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24623 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Feb;61(2):297-301. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24623.

PROCEDURES: A chart review and assessment of services was performed to assess childhood leukemia diagnoses, treatment, and outcomes in Tanzania at the Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. Results were compared to those from a 2005 evaluation that showed only one of 20 children with leukemia surviving at 1 year. RESULTS: During the study period, 106 patients presented with leukemia, including 81 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 25 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Forty-nine of 58 (84%) patients with ALL, and six of 17 (35%) with AML who received therapy and had complete data, achieved complete remission. Estimated 2-year event-free survival for all patients with ALL was 33%; for AML it was 0%. Ten patients died prior to initiation of therapy, 19 died of toxicity, and eight abandoned therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Though leukemia survival in Tanzania remains far below that in HICs, survival rates for ALL have significantly improved in recent years due to standardization of treatment regimens and better staff, though AML outcome remains dismal.

However, there are no large studies on outcomes of children with -5/5q- AML. To determine the disease correlates of this group, we retrospectively analyzed cytogenetic data from five studies of childhood AML. PROCEDURE: Data from patients whose cytogenetic clones included -5/5q-, with the exception of those with acute promyelocytic leukemia or Down syndrome, were included. RESULTS: Of the 2,240 patients with cytogenetic data available, 26 (1.2%) had -5 or 5q-. A significant number of these patients were age 11-21 (61.5%, P = 0.031) and had M0 morphology compared with patients without -5/5q- (24.0% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001). Twenty-two of the 26 patients had a complete remission (CR) response to induction chemotherapy. The 5-year overall survival (OS) from the time of diagnosis for the -5/5q- patients was significantly lower than for patients without -5/5q- (27 +/- 17% vs. 50 +/- 2%, P = 0.027).

Recently, it has been shown that CD200 may improve the distinction between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; CD200+) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; CD200-), but the role of CD200 expression in atypical CLL and other MBN remains to be established. Methods: To address this issue, we investigated the expression of CD200 in 159 consecutive cases of MBN. Results: CD200 was strongly expressed in CLL and was revealed to be an excellent marker to distinguish CLL from MCL, even in cases of atypical CLL. However, lack of CD200 was not an exclusive finding of MCL, being also observed in other MBNs. Furthermore, CD200 was highly expressed in hairy cell leukemia, being useful in the differential diagnosis of lymphomas with villous lymphocytes. Herein, we propose an algorithm to classify CD5+ MBNs based on the expression of CD200, CD11c, heavy chain immunoglobulins and Matutes score. Conclusions: These results expand the understanding of the CD200 expression in MBNs, giving further support for the inclusion of this marker in the routine investigation by flow cytometry.

Here, we report that HPIP is overexpressed in most of 328 liver cancer patients and regulates hepatoma cell proliferation through G2/M checkpoint activation. HPIP increased anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of human liver cancer cell lines. The amino acid region 531-631 of HPIP was important for its modulation of liver cancer cell growth. The increased effects of HPIP on liver cancer cell proliferation were associated with activation of the G2/M cell-cycle concomitant with a marked increase of cyclin B1 and the inhibition of the negative G2/M phase regulator GADD45alpha. HPIP knockdown dramatically suppressed the growth of HepG2 liver cancer cells in nude mice.

Most are cured using chemotherapy without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We report on pubertal development and compare self-reported parenthood among AML survivors and their siblings. PROCEDURE: We included 137 children treated for AML according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)-AML-84, -88, and -93 trials, who were alive by June 2007. Patients with relapse or treated with HSCT were excluded. AML survivors participated in a physical and biochemical examination (n = 102) and completed a questionnaire (n = 101). One of their siblings completed an identical questionnaire (n = 84). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 11 years (range 5-25) after diagnosis of AML the survivors (median age 16 years, range 5-36) were either prepubertal or had entered puberty normally. Serum levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), inhibin A and B, and testicular volumes were within normal ranges. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were decreased in 5 of 40 postpubertal females. Mean reported age at menarche was 13.1 (range 11-17) years. Among survivors 15 years of age or older 31% of females reported pregnancies and 9% of males reported pregnancies in their partners, rates comparable with the frequency reported by their siblings. CONCLUSIONS: Most AML survivors treated with chemotherapy had normal pubertal development and fertility, however, AMH levels were decreased in 13% of postpubertal females. Longer follow-up is necessary to evaluate possible risk of premature ovarian failure.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Molgaard-Hansen, Lene', 'Skou, Anne-Sofie', 'Juul, Anders', 'Glosli, Heidi', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jarfelt, Marianne', 'Jonmundsson, Guethmundur K', 'Malmros, Johan', 'Nysom, Karsten', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Molgaard-Hansen L', 'Skou AS', 'Juul A', 'Glosli H', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jarfelt M', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Malmros J', 'Nysom K', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130823,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Mullerian Hormone/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Puberty/*drug effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'fertility', 'late effects', 'premature ovarian failure', 'puberty']",2013/09/17 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24715 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Dec;60(12):1988-95. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24715.

The basic science of epigenetics uses analytical tools that, although powerful, are not well suited to the analysis of heterogeneous cell populations found in human cancers, or for monitoring the effects of drugs designed to modulate epigenetic mechanisms in patients. To address this, we selected three clinically relevant histone marks (H3K27me3, H3K9ac, and H3K9me2), modulated their expression levels by in vitro treatments to generate high and low expressing control cells, and tested the relative sensitivity of candidate antibodies to detect the differences in expression levels by flow cytoametry using a range of sample preparation techniques. We identified monoclonal antibodies to all three histone marks that were suitable for flow cytoametry. Staining intensities were reduced with increasing formaldehyde concentration, and were not affected by ionic strength or by alcohol treatment. A protocol suitable for clinical samples was then developed, to allow combined labeling of histone marks and surface antigens while preserving light scatter signals. This was applied to normal donor blood, and to samples obtained from 25 patients with leukemia (predominantly acute myeloid leukemia). Significant cellular heterogeneity in H3K9ac and H3K27me3 staining was seen in normal peripheral blood, but the patterns were very similar between individual donors. In contrast, H3K27me3 in particular showed considerable inter-patient heterogeneity in the leukemia cell populations.

Currently, stage, histology, age (< or > 24 months), and combined loss of heterozygosity at 1p and 16q in chemotherapy-naive WTs are the only risk factors used for treatment stratification. However, they predict only less than one-third of all relapsing patients, implying that other factors are involved in treatment failure. Previous studies have associated 1q gain with adverse outcome. Therefore, in this study, the role of 1q gain and other common cytogenetic aberrations (CAs) in WTs was investigated and related to follow-up data from patients with WT treated in the United Kingdom; 19% (64/331) had 1q gain. Gain of 1q was significantly associated with 16q loss (P < 0.001) and 1p loss (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis taking account of age, tumor stage, anaplasia, and common CA (e.g., 1p loss and 16q loss), 1q gain was independently associated with adverse event-free survival [EFS; hazard ratio (HR) = 2.45, P = 0.02] and overall survival (HR = 4.28, P = 0.004).

It has been demonstrated that CD4 plays a critical role in AML development. However, studies of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD44 gene have not touched upon AML. This case-control study probed the contribution of functional SNPs in CD44 gene to AML susceptibility in eastern Chinese population. Five representative SNPs of CD44 (rs10836347C>T, rs13347C>T, rs1425802A>G, rs11821102G>A, rs713330T>C) were opted and genotyped in 421 AML patients and 461 healthy subjects and the association with risk of AML was estimated by logistic regression. Moreover, the potential role of rs13347C > T in AML was further explored. Compared with the rs13347CC genotype, CT carriers had a significant increase in AML susceptibility (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-2.34), TT carriers had a further increased risk of AML (OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.69-4.21). Furthermore, our transient transfection assay and Western blot results demonstrated that the presence of rs13347T allele led to more CD44 expression. Yet, there exists no significant difference in genotype frequencies of the other four sites between cases and controls. Above findings suggest that rs13347C>T in 3'UTR of CD44 may be a genetic modifier for developing AML.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wu, Hongchun', 'Deng, Jieqiong', 'Zheng, Jian', 'You, Yonghe', 'Li, Na', 'Li, Wei', 'Wu, Depei', 'Zhou, Yifeng']","['Wu H', 'Deng J', 'Zheng J', 'You Y', 'Li N', 'Li W', 'Wu D', 'Zhou Y']","['Laboratory of Cancer Molecular Genetics, Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, P.R.

A detailed DAPK2 expression analysis in two large AML patient cohorts revealed particularly low DAPK2 mRNA levels in APL. DAPK2 levels were restored in APL patients undergoing ATRA therapy. PML-RARA is the predominant lesion in APL causing transcriptional repression of genes important for neutrophil differentiation. We found binding of PML-RARA and PU.1, a myeloid master regulator, to RARA and PU.1 binding sites in the DAPK2 promoter. Ectopic expression of PML-RARA in non-APL, as well as knocking down PU.1 in APL cells, resulted in a significant reduction of DAPK2 expression. Restoring DAPK2 expression in PU.1 knockdown APL cells partially rescued neutrophil differentiation, thereby identifying DAPK2 as a relevant PU.1 downstream effector. Moreover, low DAPK2 expression is also associated with C/EBPalpha-mutated AML patients, and we found C/EBPalpha-dependent regulation of DAPK2 during APL differentiation.

Here we investigate the role of the mitochondrial (or intrinsic) apoptosis pathway in modulating the onset and outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cell death is a highly regulated process that plays an essential role in regulating cell homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high intrinsic proliferating capacity such as the hematopoietic system. Following the underlying paradigm that cis-acting genetic variation can influence disease risk and outcomes by modulating gene expression, we performed a systematic analysis of the proximal promoter regions of 21 genes involved in apoptosis. Using gene reporter assays, we show that promoter variations in 11 intrinsic apoptosis genes, including ADPRT, APAF1, BCL2, BAD, BID, MCL1, BIRC4, BCL2L1, ENDOG, YWHAB, and YWHAQ, influence promoter activity in an allele-specific manner. We also show that correlated promoter variation and increased expression of MCL1 is associated with reduced overall survival among high-risk patients receiving higher doses of corticosteroid, suggesting that increased expression of this anti-apoptosis gene could lead to reduced cell death and influence treatment response in a disease- and dose-responsive manner.",,"['Sanchez, Rocio', 'St-Cyr, Janick', 'Lalonde, Marie-Eve', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Gagne, Vincent', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Kritikou, Ekaterini A', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Sanchez R', 'St-Cyr J', 'Lalonde ME', 'Healy J', 'Richer C', 'Gagne V', 'Laverdiere C', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE', 'Neuberg D', 'Kutok JL', 'Kritikou EA', 'Krajinovic M', 'Sinnett D']",['daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130913,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', '*Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/mortality']",,,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/07/25 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.085340 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.085340 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Feb;99(2):314-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.085340.

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancers were calculated for these patients in comparison with the population without HBV infection. Five hundred sixty-seven of whom developed cancer (SIR 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-1.97)) during the study period. The SIR for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with HBV infection was 40.58 (95% CI 30.50-50.07).

The risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia were increased in both Swedish- and foreign-born patients with HBV infection.

The dosage of PU.1 has been shown to cause a shift in myelomonocytic progenitor fate. Pin1 is a unique substrate-specific enzyme that can isomerize phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro peptide bonds, accelerating the conformational change in its substrates between a cis and a trans form. Such activity has been demonstrated to be a tightly controlled mechanism regulating a wide variety of protein functions under both normal physiological and pathological conditions. We have previously reported that a conformational change in Runx2 induced by Pin1 is essential for its function in osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we show that the Pin1-mediated conformational change in Runx1 enhances its acetylation and stabilization and, consequently, enhances its transacting activity. The increased acetylation of Runx1 represses PU.1 transcription in pre-monocytes. Conversely, the lack of (or the inhibition of) Pin1 increases PU.1 transcription in vitro and in vivo in pre-monocytes and in the spleen tissue. Pin1 KO mice have an increased CD11b(+) /F4/80(+) cell population and F4/80 protein expression in spleen. From our data, we can conclude that the conformational change in Runx1 induced by Pin1 represses PU.1 transcription in pre-monocytes and influences the commitment to the monocyte lineage. The dosage of PU.1 is a crucial factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and Pin1 may thus be a useful target for controlling PU.1-dependent hematopoiesis, as well as leukemogenesis.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Islam, Rabia', 'Yoon, Won-Joon', 'Woo, Kyung-Mi', 'Baek, Jeong-Hwa', 'Ryoo, Hyun-Mo']","['Islam R', 'Yoon WJ', 'Woo KM', 'Baek JH', 'Ryoo HM']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Pin1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24462 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2014 Apr;229(4):443-52. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24462.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both groups showed a comparable relapse incidence and 2-year probability of graft-versus-host disease. The negative prognostic effects of CMV seropositivity of the donor and/or the recipient (vs CMV seronegativity of both) were significantly stronger for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), resulting in a markedly reduced 2-year overall survival (46% vs 55% for ALL compared with 52% vs 56% for AML). The important prognostic impact of donor/recipient CMV serostatus remained in a multivariate Cox regression analysis including the other prognostic variables.

PC-046 has growth inhibitory activity in a variety of tumor types in vitro, and efficacy in SCID mice was shown in human tumor xenografts of MV-4-11 acute myeloid leukemia, MM.1S multiple myeloma, and DU-145 prostate cancer. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated relatively high oral bioavailability (71%) with distribution to both plasma and bone marrow. No myelosuppression was seen in non-tumor bearing SCID mice given a single dose just under the acute lethal dose. The COMPARE algorithm in the NCI-60 cell line panel demonstrated that PC-046 closely correlated to other known tubulin destabilizing agents (correlation coefficients approximately 0.7 for vincristine and vinblastine). Mechanism of action studies showed cell cycle arrest in metaphase and inhibition of tubulin polymerization.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A group of 136 patients with cMBL and a group of 216 Rai0-CLL cases were investigated prospectively. RESULTS: IGHV-mutated cases were significantly more frequent among cMBLs (P = 0.005), whereas the distribution of CD38 and ZAP-70 positive cases, of patients with NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations or exhibiting the major CLL cytogenetic abnormalities, was similar in the two groups. Moreover, no significant differences were found either in IGHV/IGHD/IGHJ gene usage or in the overall prevalence of stereotyped IGHV gene sequences. Cells from cMBL and Rai0-CLL exhibited similar gene and microRNA (miRNA) signatures; in addition, when grouped according to the IGHV mutational status, IGHV-unmutated cases showed different transcriptional signatures compared with IGHV-mutated patients, irrespective of the cMBL or Rai0-CLL classification. cMBL diagnosis per se was predictive of longer progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our study based on a prospective series of patients indicates that no major differences exist between the circulating cells from cMBL and Rai0-CLL, at least based on a comparison of the markers used in the study. This possibly suggests that the two conditions mainly differ in the initial size of the monoclonal cell population, which may influence the subsequent timing of clonal expansion and clinical manifestations.",,"['Morabito, Fortunato', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Ferracin, Manuela', 'Zagatti, Barbara', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Maura, Francesco', 'Matis, Serena', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Massucco, Carlotta', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Bossio, Sabrina', 'De Stefano, Laura', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Monti, Sara', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Morabito F', 'Mosca L', 'Cutrona G', 'Agnelli L', 'Tuana G', 'Ferracin M', 'Zagatti B', 'Lionetti M', 'Fabris S', 'Maura F', 'Matis S', 'Gentile M', 'Vigna E', 'Colombo M', 'Massucco C', 'Recchia AG', 'Bossio S', 'De Stefano L', 'Ilariucci F', 'Musolino C', 'Molica S', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Tassone P', 'Negrini M', 'Monti S', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Onco-Hematology, A.O. of Cosenza, Cosenza; Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano and Hematology 1 CTMO, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano; SS Molecular Diagnostics, Scientific Direction, and Direzione Scientifica, IRCCS, San Martino IST, Genoa; Department of Experimental and Diagnostic Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara; Division of Hematology, A.O.

With the increasing number of oral agents in cancer therapy, oral drug-drug interactions are becoming more relevant. Nilotinib has already been shown to be absorbed to a much lesser extent when co-administered with proton pump inhibitors. Because exposure to sub-therapeutic concentrations of anticancer drugs such as nilotinib may result in selection of resistant clones and ultimately relapse, we studied the effect of a calcium carbonate supplement (Tums Ultra 1000(R)) on nilotinib pharmacokinetics. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Calcium carbonate may be co-administered with nilotinib without significantly affecting the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib and potentially impacting efficacy. PURPOSE: Nilotinib is a second-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with superior efficacy compared with imatinib mesylate in the treatment for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Calcium carbonate is commonly used as a source of calcium supplementation or as antacid to ameliorate the gastrointestinal side effects associated with nilotinib, which could have unknown effects on nilotinib absorption. The purpose of this study was to provide information on the effect of calcium carbonate on the PK of nilotinib in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Healthy subjects were enrolled in a two-period, open-label, single-institution, randomized, cross-over, fixed-schedule study. In one period, each subject received 400 mg of nilotinib p.o. In the other period, 4,000 mg of calcium carbonate (4 X Tums Ultra 1000(R)) was administered p.o. 15 min prior to the nilotinib dose. Plasma samples were collected at specified timepoints, concentrations of nilotinib were quantitated by LC-MS, and data were analyzed non-compartmentally. RESULTS: Eleven subjects were evaluable. Calcium supplementation did not significantly affect nilotinib pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (18.4 mug/mL h alone vs. 16.9 mug/mL h with calcium carbonate, p = 0.83; 80 % power); maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) (0.670 mug/mL alone vs. 6.18 mug/mL with calcium carbonate, p = 0.97); or half-life (18.9 h alone vs. 17.2 h with calcium carbonate, p = 0.18).

It is known that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the Trithorax group/Mixed lineage leukemia (TrxG/Mll) complex are able to set repressive and active histone marks, respectively. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can interact with either of these complexes and guide them to regulatory elements, thereby modifying the expression levels of target genes. The lncRNA Fendrr is transiently expressed in lateral mesoderm of mid-gestational mouse embryos and was shown to interact with both PRC2 and TrxG/Mll complexes in vivo. Gene targeting revealed that loss of Fendrr results in impaired differentiation of tissues derived from lateral mesoderm, the heart and the body wall, ultimately leading to embryonic death. Molecular data suggests that Fendrr acts via dsDNA/RNA triplex formation at target regulatory elements, and directly increases PRC2 occupancy at these sites. This, in turn, modifies the ratio of repressive to active marks, adjusting the expression levels of Fendrr target genes in lateral mesoderm. We propose that Fendrr also mediates long-term epigenetic marks to define expression levels of its target genes within the descendants of lateral mesoderm cells. Here we discuss approaches for lncRNA gene knockouts in the mouse, and suggest a model how Fendrr and possibly other lncRNAs act during embryogenesis.",,"['Grote, Phillip', 'Herrmann, Bernhard G']","['Grote P', 'Herrmann BG']","['Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics; Department Developmental Genetics; Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics; Department Developmental Genetics; Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130822,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', '*Embryonic Development', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fendrr', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'embryogenesis', 'epigenetic control', 'histone modification', 'lncRNA', 'long non-coding RNA', 'mouse']",2013/09/17 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['26165 [pii]', '10.4161/rna.26165 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA Biol. 2013 Oct;10(10):1579-85. doi: 10.4161/rna.26165.

The anti-cancer effect of TQ, via the induction of apoptosis resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction, was assessed in an acute lymphocyte leukemic cell line (CEMss) with an IC50 of 1.5 microg/mL. A significant increase in chromatin condensation in the cell nucleus was observed using fluorescence analysis. The apoptosis was then confirmed by Annexin V and an increased number of cellular DNA breaks in treated cells were observed as a DNA ladder. Treatment of CEMss cells with TQ encouraged apoptosis with cell death-transducing signals by a down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax. Moreover, the significant generation of cellular ROS, HSP70 and activation of caspases 3 and 8 were also observed in the treated cells.

Certain symptoms such as oxygen sensitivity, hematological abnormalities and impaired immunity suggest that FA proteins could participate in or independently control other pathways as well. In this study, we identified 9 DNA repair genes that were down regulated in a genome wide analysis of 6 Indian Fanconi anemia patients.

Microarray data revealed the down regulation of ATXN3, ARID4A and ETS-1, which were validated by RTPCR in a subsequent sample set of 9 Indian FA patients. Here we report for the first time a gene expression profile of Fanconi anemia patients from the Indian population and a pool of genes that might aid in the acquisition and progression of the FA phenotype.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Integral to its function is the ability of PML to form nuclear bodies (NBs) that serve as hubs for the interaction and modification of over 90 cellular proteins. There are seven canonical isoforms of PML, which encode diverse C-termini generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Recruitment of specific cellular proteins to PML NBs is mediated by protein-protein interactions with individual PML isoforms. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen employing peptide sequences unique to PML isoform I (PML-I), we identified an interaction with the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit K (eIF3K), and in the process identified a novel eIF3K isoform, which we term eIF3K-2. We further demonstrate that eIF3K and PML interact both in vitro via pull-down assays, as well as in vivo within human cells by co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence. In addition, eIF3K isoform 2 (eIF3K-2) colocalizes to PML bodies, particularly those enriched in PML-I, while eIF3K isoform 1 associates poorly with PML NBs. Thus, we report eIF3K as the first known subunit of the eIF3 translation pre-initiation complex to interact directly with the PML protein, and provide data implicating alternative splicing of both PML and eIF3K as a possible regulatory mechanism for eIF3K localization at PML NBs.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, we examined the effects of bryostatin 5 on acute monocytic leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. We also explored the mechanisms and pathways underlying the increase in apoptosis induced by bryostatin 5. Bryostatin 5 inhibited the growth of primary acute monocytic leukemia cells and U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manners. Bryostatin 5 also induced an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in U937 cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that bryostatin 5-treated cells displayed typical apoptotic characteristics (chromatin condensation, karyopyknosis and formation of crescents and apoptotic bodies). In addition, bryostatin 5 increased the expression of P53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and slightly increased P53 expression. Bryostatin 5 also significantly decreased Bcl-XL expression and significantly increased the expression levels of Bak, Bax, cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 3. The pro-apoptotic activity of bryostatin 5 in U937 cells was inhibited by PUMA siRNA and z-LEHD-fmk (a specific caspase 9 inhibitor). In addition, the PUMA siRNA significantly affected the expression of cleaved caspase 9, whereas z-LEHD-fmk had little effect on the expression of PUMA. The results suggest that PUMA is located upstream of caspase 9 in this apoptotic signaling pathway. These novel findings provide mechanistic insight into the induction of apoptosis by bryostatin 5 and might facilitate the development of clinical strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of treatments for acute monocytic leukemia.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Standard AML therapy requires intensive chemotherapy with a low rate of durable remission and is associated with significant treatment-related toxicity, especially in elderly patients. Therefore, new therapeutic options for the treatment of AML are urgently needed. We previously reported that the novel angiogenic inhibitor, angiocidin, induces differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. Here we investigate the effects of angiocidin on AML cells lines and primary AML cells. Differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry measuring the increase in expression of cell surface marker characteristic of normal macrophages. Four AML cell lines (THP-1, Mono-mac-1, HL-60 and MV4-11) and 5 of 10 primary human AML samples showed evidence of differentiation when cultured in vitro for 24 h with 10 mug/mL angiocidin. Additionally, we found that angiocidin promoted secretion of a number of cytokines from the cell lines as well as patient cells. We next evaluated the effect of angiocidin on a xenotransplanted primary human AML sample engrafted in NSG mice. We found angiocidin monotherapy reduced the human AML burden in bone marrow by 63% relative to untreated control. Interestingly, angiocidin+cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) combination therapy reduced human AML in bone marrow by 79%. We believe the combination of in vitro data supporting the capacity of angiocidin to drive differentiation in multiple AML cell lines and primary human AML samples and its activity in a xenotransplantation model that reproduces the human disease is significant. These observations support the continued evaluation and development of angiocidin as a potential novel, non-toxic therapy for AML.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a massage protocol in relieving pain in children hospitalized with cancer. METHODS: a randomized, controlled, and single-blind trial was performed in a sample of 52 children aged between 10 and 18 years who were hospitalized in a pediatric cancer ward. The intervention consisted of the implementation of a massage protocol with three sessions of 20 to 30minutes on alternate days over a one-week period. The effectiveness of the protocol was evaluated by assessing pain using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), while the effectiveness of each massage session was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). RESULTS: the massage protocol was only effective in reducing the interference of pain in walking (p<0.05), although it also contributed to relieve pain and its impact on the children's activities. After each massage session, the intensity of the pain experienced by the child decreased (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: despite the small sample size, massage therapy appears to be a useful intervention in reducing pain in children with cancer. However, there are still questions regarding the effectiveness of this massage protocol. The authors recommend its use due to its contribution to the promotion of the child's well-being and quality of life.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

The enzyme O-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc, whereas O-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) removes it. O-GlcNAcylation plays a role in fundamental regulatory mechanisms through the modification of proteins involved in cell division, metabolism, transcription, cell signaling and apoptosis. The effects of O-GlcNAcylation on apoptosis appear to be cell-dependent, as elevated levels played a protective role in primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes but had a cytotoxic effect in rat pancreatic beta-cells. The aim of the current study was to determine the implications of the O-GlcNAc modification on T cell apoptosis. METHODS: Human T lymphoblastic HPB-ALL cells were treated with the OGA inhibitor O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), or with glucosamine (GlcN), to increase O-GlcNAcylation. Apoptosis was induced in the presence of tributyltin (TBT). DNA fragmentation was observed by cell cycle analysis and corresponded to the sub G0/G1 population. O-GlcNAcylated proteins were detected by immunoblot using a specific antibody (ctd110.6) and were precipitated using succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA). RESULTS: HPB-ALL cells treated with PUGNAc displayed a significant reduction in DNA fragmentation after TBT-induced apoptosis. DFF45, the protein that inhibits the endonuclease DFF40, was identified to be O-GlcNAc modified. O-GlcNAcylated DFF45 appeared to be more resistant to caspase cleavage during apoptosis. Our results suggest that a decrease in the O-GlcNAc modification on DFF45 occurs before its cleavage by caspase. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the O-GlcNAcylation of DFF45 may represent a mechanism to control the accidental activation of DFF.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Johnson, Bruno', 'Opimba, Marlyse', 'Bernier, Jacques']","['Johnson B', 'Opimba M', 'Bernier J']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, 531 Boul. des Prairies, Laval, QC H7V1B7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130913,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Phenylcarbamates)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Trialkyltin Compounds)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '132489-69-1 (N-acetylglucosaminono-1,5-lactone O-(phenylcarbamoyl)oxime)', '4XDX163P3D (tributyltin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*pathology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oximes/pharmacology', 'Phenylcarbamates/pharmacology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trialkyltin Compounds/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'DFF', 'DFF45', 'O-(2-acetamidO-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate', 'O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine', 'TBT']",2013/09/17 06:00,2014/03/14 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(13)00386-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014 Jan;1840(1):191-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.09.011.

Despite the potential for prolonged or accidental exposure to PA in industrial settings, the toxicity potential of PA was not well characterized. To address the knowledge gaps relevant to the toxicity profile of PA, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted 2-week, 14-week and 2-year studies in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice. For the 2-week inhalation study, the rats and mice were exposed to 0, 31.3, 62.5, 125, 250 or 500ppm. Significant mortality was observed in both rats and mice exposed to >/=125ppm of PA. The major target organ of toxicity in both mice and rats was the liver with exposure-related histopathological changes (250 and 500ppm). Based on the decreased survival in the 2-week study, the rats and mice were exposed to 0, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64ppm of PA in the 14-week study. No treatment-related mortality was observed. Mean body weights of male (>/=8ppm) and female mice (32 and 64ppm) were significantly decreased (7-16%). Histopathological changes were noted in the nasal cavity, and included suppurative inflammation, squamous metaplasia, hyaline droplet accumulation, olfactory epithelium atrophy, and necrosis. In the 2-year inhalation studies, the rats were exposed to 0, 16, 32 and 64ppm of PA and the mice were exposed to 0, 8, 16 and 32ppm of PA. Survival of male rats was significantly reduced (32 and 64ppm). Mean body weights of 64ppm male rats were significantly decreased relative to the controls. Both mice and rats showed a spectrum of non-neoplastic changes in the nose. Increased neoplastic incidences of nasal respiratory/transitional epithelial adenoma were observed in both rats and mice. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in male rats and was considered to be treatment-related. In conclusion, the key findings from this study indicated that the nose was the primary target organ of toxicity for PA. Long term inhalation exposure to PA led to nonneoplastic changes in the nose, and increased incidences of respiratory/transitional epithelial adenomas in both mice and rats. Increased incidences of harderian gland adenoma may also have been related to exposure to PA in male mice.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

CXCR4 overexpression predicts unfavorable prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutation is the most frequent genetic abnormality in patients with AML and predicts a favorable prognosis. In vitro studies have suggested that mutant nucleophosmin (NPM) decreases CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis by downregulating CXCR4, thereby linking the NPM and CXCR4 pathways. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a group of 117 untreated adults with AML, we used immunohistochemistry to assess bone marrow specimens for CXCR4 and phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) expression. All cases also were analyzed for NPM1 mutations using polymerase chain reaction-based methods. RESULTS: CXCR4 expression was detected in 75 patients (64%), and pCXCR4 expression was detected in 31 patients (26%). NPM1 mutations were detected in 63 patients (54%). NPM1 mutations did not correlate with CXCR4 (P = .212) or pCXCR4 (P = .355) expression. The median 5-year overall survival was 27% (95% confidence interval, 19-36), with a median follow-up of 8 months (95% confidence interval, 6-15). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, reduced overall and progression-free survival rates were associated with a history of antecedent hematologic disorder, failure to achieve complete remission, thrombocytopenia, unfavorable cytogenetics, CXCR4 expression, and wild-type NPM1. pCXCR4 expression was independently associated with shorter progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: There is no correlation between NPM1 mutations and CXCR4 or pCXCR4 expression, suggesting that the CXCR4 and NPM pathways act independently in adult AML.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A total of 137 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL, who sequentially entered the Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center between January 2005 and September 2010, were included in the study. Nest-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and TA cloning were used to analyze the expression of IKAROS isoforms in these children. The relationship between frequency of DN IKAROS isoforms and prognosis of B-ALL was investigated. RESULTS: Of the 137 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL, 16 had expression of IK6, 14 had expression of IK4, and 2 had expression of IK7. There was significant difference in 2.5-year event-free survival between the cohorts of DN IKAROS and non-DN IKAROS (P=0.01). Analysis of the 10 paired of diagnosis/relapse samples from 10 patients with recurrence showed that 8 of 10 paired diagnosis and relapse samples had inconsistent expression of IKAROS isoforms. The rate of IK6 expression in relapse samples from 21 relapse ALL patients was significantly higher than in the 137 children with newly diagnosed ALL (62% vs 12%, P<0.01).

This study aims to evaluate the drug-related toxicities of CCLG-ALL 08 protocol in the treatment of childhood ALL. METHODS: A total of 114 children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated with the CCLG-ALL 08 protocol. The protocol was divided into five phases: remission induction (VDLD), early reinforcement (CAM), consolidation therapy, delayed reinforcement (DIa & DIb) and maintenance treatment. Drug-related toxicities in each phase were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. RESULTS: Toxicities were more frequent in phase VDLD than other treatment phases, including hepatotoxicity (87.7%), dental ulcer (20.2%), hyperglycemia (20.2%), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (21.1%) and decreased fibrinogen (34.2%), with the incidence rates of severe adverse events at 7%, 0, 1.3%, 0.8% and 2.7% respectively. The incidence of allergic reaction to L-ASP was significantly higher in phase DIa than in phase VDLD (28.0% vs 7.9%; P<0.01), and there were no longer any allergic reactions in 15 patients who received continuing treatment with pegaspargase instead. There was no severe arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, decreased left ventricular function, osteonecrosis, myopathy, organ failure or treatment-related mortality.

CASE REPORT: He underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from a one HLA-DR allele-mismatched unrelated donor to achieve the first complete remission of leukemia. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (180 mg/m(2)) and busulfan (8.0 mg/kg) without T-cell depletion. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Cefotaxime was prescribed for a secondary bacterial infection in a perianal abscess before the start of conditioning chemotherapy. Although low-grade diarrhea persisted, there were no signs of either acute GVHD or CD in the mucosal biopsy specimens on day 24.

CIH has been identified to mediate mitochondrial damage in genioglossus. It has been reported that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) could be induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the role of ERS in CIH-induced genioglossus injury, as well as the possible intervention effect of adiponectin (Ad) supplement in rats. METHODS: Forty-five male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups and submitted to room air (group A, n=15) as a control or CIH (groups B and C, n=15, respectively). Throughout the exposure period, intravenous Ad was given in group C; while intravenous normal saline was simultaneously given in groups A and B. After 35-day exposure, genioglossus samples were obtained from the pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats via surgical dissection, following blood sampling. Western blotting was applied to detect expressions of ERS signals and associated apoptotic pathways in genioglossus. Serum adiponectin levels were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Significant hypoadiponectinemia was revealed in group B only (P < 0.05). Compared to those in groups A and C, expressions of markers involved in ERS, such as glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), p-PERK, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (p-eIF2a), phosphorylated inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1a (p-IRE1a), spliced X-Box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), were significantly enhanced in group B (all P < 0.01); while no significant difference was shown between groups A and C (all P > 0.05). ERSassociated apoptotic pathways were remarkably activated in group B. The involved markers detected as the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia associatied X protein (BAX) and caspase-12 were significantly elevated (all P < 0.01). Transvenous adiponectin supplement improved the above CIHinduced pathological changes in group C. CONCLUSION: Beyond hypoadiponectinemia, CIH could enhance ERS and induce activation of ERS-associated apoptotic pathways in genioglossus, which could be significantly improved by adiponectin supplement.",,"['Zhang, Xiao-Feng', 'Huang, Han-Peng', 'Ding, Wen-Xiao', 'Ding, Ning', 'Lu, Gan', 'Liu, Jian-Nan', 'Zhang, Xi-Long']","['Zhang XF', 'Huang HP', 'Ding WX', 'Ding N', 'Lu G', 'Liu JN', 'Zhang XL']","['Department of Respiratory Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['0 (Adiponectin)'],IM,"['Adiponectin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Hypoxia/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/drug therapy']",,,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2013;126(17):3270-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of ATRA/As2 O3 combination in induction and consolidation therapy in children remains unclear. Here, we report the efficacy of combined treatment with As2 O3 and ATRA as induction and consolidation chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed childhood APL. METHODS: From 1998 to 2011, 43 children with newly diagnosed APL received induction and consolidation chemotherapy with ATRA and As2 O3 (Protocol B). Rates of complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) and drug toxicity were compared between children treated with Protocol B and 25 others treated previously with ATRA alone as induction chemotherapy (Protocol A). RESULTS: Of 43 patients treated with Protocol B, 41 (95.4%) achieved CR (two died of intracranial haemorrhage on day 10 and 14). In contrast, only 20 (80%) of 25 patients treated with Protocol A achieved CR. Thus, the CR rate was significantly lower in patients receiving induction chemotherapy with Protocol A than in those treated with Protocol B (P = 0.045, chi(2) = 6.508). Of the 41 patients who achieved CR on induction therapy with Protocol B, 40 also received consolidation therapy. Molecular relapse, but no overt morphological relapse, occurred in one patient at 25 months after diagnosis; this patient regained CR status with As2 O3 treatment. With a median follow-up period of 75 months, estimated EFS, DFS and OS rates were 92.5 +/- 4.2%, 97.1 +/- 2.9% and 95.3 +/- 3.2%, respectively, for Protocol B. In contrast, with a median follow-up of 127 months, the EFS, DFS and OS rates at 75 months were 70.4 +/- 9.4%, 76.4 +/- 9.2% and 70.4 +/- 9.4%, respectively, for Protocol A. Thus, patients treated with Protocol A showed significantly lower EFS (P = 0.021) and OS (P = 0.007) rates than those treated with Protocol B. CONCLUSIONS: Application of As2 O3 and ATRA as induction and consolidation chemotherapy resulted in excellent outcomes and improved long-term prognosis in children with newly diagnosed APL.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is commonly associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and hematological malignancies. Herein, we report two cases of Japanese patients diagnosed with genital pyoderma gangrenosum. Case 1 was a 74-year-old woman without associated systemic complications, whose skin lesion resembled a squamous cell carcinoma and was limited to the vulva. Case 2 is an 89-year-old man, who suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, and presented with penile and leg ulcers mimicking pressure sores. Both cases responded well to systemic steroids. We review 13 genital pyoderma gangrenosum cases (76.9% male; aged 30-89 years) from 1996 to 2012 in Japan, including 11 previously reported cases and the present study's two cases. Four of the 13 genital pyoderma gangrenosum cases had associated systemic diseases and their skin lesions spread to the extragenital areas. Eight of the remaining nine genitalia-localized pyoderma gangrenosum cases had no associated systemic diseases. In conclusion, genital pyoderma gangrenosum is rare and may be misdiagnosed.

BCR-ABL1 negative patients received weekly asparaginase during intensification, while BCR-ABL1+ patients received daily imatinib. Post-remission therapy was given in an outpatient setting.

Only a few case reports have mentioned their presence in other contexts, mainly mature B-cell neoplasms such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or reactive circumstances such as multiple sclerosis undergoing natalizumab treatment. We sought to investigate whether any particular morphologic features of BNL were more specific to PPBL than other diseases. We reviewed peripheral blood smears of a series of patients affected by PPBL or harboring BNLs whatever the diagnosis. We found that BNLs in PPBL were heterogeneous, but mostly medium-sized with a moderately abundant basophilic cytoplasm, sometimes vacuolated. The chromatin was mature in an asymmetrically bilobed nucleus showing one to two nucleoli. Though mainly observed in patients with PPBL, all these criteria remained non-specific. Conversely, the presence of either monocytoid or hyperbasophilic cells had clinical value to confirm PPBL. We conclude that a substantial percentage of BNLs possessing the morphologic features described and observed in a context of monocytoid and/or hyperbasophilic lymphocytes is predictive of the diagnosis of PPBL.",,"['Lesesve, Jean-Francois', 'Gressot, Anne-Lise', 'Troussard, Xavier', 'Mossafa, Hossein', 'Cornet, Edouard']","['Lesesve JF', 'Gressot AL', 'Troussard X', 'Mossafa H', 'Cornet E']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU Brabois , Nancy , France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131106,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['Persistent Polyclonal B-Cell Lymphocytosis'],IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/pathology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Multiple Sclerosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm Grading']",['NOTNLM'],"['Binucleated lymphocyte', 'lymphocyte morphology', 'persistent B-cell lymphocytosis']",2013/09/17 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.843680 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Jul;55(7):1551-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.843680.

Resistance to this drug is an important cause of treatment failure in both species. Using canine lymphoid cell lines, we found that L-asp sensitivity is strongly negatively correlated with the level of methylation of the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) promoter. Selection for in vitro resistance was accompanied by increased ASNS promoter methylation and decreased ASNS mRNA expression. In addition, treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine increased resistance to L-asp. ASNS methylation and expression is not predictive of overall survival or progression-free survival in canine lymphoma patients treated with L-asp.

The concept of stem-like cells in cancer has been gaining currency over the last decade or so, since evidence for stem cell activity in human leukaemia and solid tumours, including breast cancer, was first published. Evidence indicates that this sub-population of cells, known as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), is responsible for driving tumour formation and disease progression. In breast cancer, there is good evidence that CSCs are intrinsically resistant to conventional chemo-, radio- and endocrine therapies. By evading the effects of these treatments, CSCs are held culpable for disease recurrence. Hence, in order to improve treatment there is a need to develop CSC-targeted therapies. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), an inflammatory cytokine, is upregulated in breast cancer and associated with poor prognostic factors. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that IL-8, through its receptors CXCR1/2, is an important regulator of breast CSC activity. Inhibiting CXCR1/2 signalling has proved efficacious in pre-clinical models of breast cancer providing a good rationale for targeting CXCR1/2 clinically. Here, we discuss the role of IL-8 in breast CSC regulation and development of novel therapies to target CXCR1/2 signalling in breast cancer.",,"['Singh, Jagdeep K', 'Simoes, Bruno M', 'Clarke, Robert B', 'Bundred, Nigel J']","['Singh JK', 'Simoes BM', 'Clarke RB', 'Bundred NJ']","['University of Manchester, Institute of Cancer Sciences, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Breast Biology Group , Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 4BX , UK +44 161 446 3210 ; jagdeep.rai@some.oxon.org.']",['eng'],['Editorial'],20130914,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2013/09/17 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/09/17 06:00'],"['2013/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2013.835398 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2013 Nov;17(11):1235-41. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2013.835398.

Here we report how to tune and control the properties of CdSe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell QDs in water, using poly(isoprene-block-ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO) as a versatile system of amphiphilic diblock copolymers for the micellular encapsulation of nanoparticles (NPs). We show the synthesis of a novel PI-b-(PEO)2 miktoarm star polymer and how this different architecture besides the variation of the polymers' molecular weight gives us the opportunity to control the size of the built constructs in water between 24 and 53 nm. Because of this size control, an upper limit of the construct's diameter for the cellular uptake could be determined by a systemic study with human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) and murine macrophage leukemia cell (RAW-264.7). Furthermore, fluorescence quenching experiments with copper(II) and iron(III) ions show a strong influence of the used polymer on the shielding against these ions. This enables us to control the permeability of the polymer shell from very porous shells, which allow an almost complete cation exchange up to very dense shells. These even offer the possibility to perform copper(I) catalyzed click reactions while keeping the fluorescence of the QDs. All these results underline the huge variability and controllability of the PI-b-PEO diblock copolymer system for the encapsulation and functionalization of nanoparticles for biological applications.

We studied 2184 CLL patients with FISH (1995-2012) for the first occurrence of 17p-, 11q-, or clonal 17p-/11q-.

Eleven of 15 (73%) tested patients with clonal 17p-/11q- had dysfunctional TP53 mutations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the impact of the addition of ATRA among patients with diploid cytogenetics treated on a randomized phase II study of fludarabine + cytarabine + idarubicine +/- G-CSF +/- ATRA with available data on their NPM1 mutation status. Between September 1995 and November 1997, 215 patients were enrolled in the study. Among them, 70 patients had diploid cytogenetic and are the subjects of this analysis. RESULTS: The median age of the 70 patients was 66 years (range 23-87). Twenty (29%) of patients had NPM1 mutations. Among them 7 (35%) did and 13 (65%) did not receive ATRA in combination with chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 71% of patients treated with ATRA as compared to 69% without ATRA (P = 0.62). With median follow-up of 12.5 years, the overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were similar among patients who received ATRA compared to no ATRA regardless of NPM1 mutation status.

T lymphocytes are known to play important part in anti-cancer immunity. The number and function of T lymphocytes are altered in chronic leukemia patients. CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes have also been found to be abnormal in cancer patients. We therefore investigated changes in the number and cytotoxicity of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of acute leukemia (AL) patients (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia), to improve our understanding of the role of this T lymphocyte subset. We analyzed CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocyte numbers and cytotoxicities in healthy controls, AL patients, and AL patients with complete remission. Lymphocyte counts were performed in peripheral blood and flow cytometry was used to determine cell numbers and cytotoxicities. The absolute number of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes was increased in AL patients (including acute myeloid [AML] and acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL]) compared with healthy controls (P<0.05), but their functioning was significantly reduced (P<0.05). The number of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes in AML and ALL patients who achieved remission following chemotherapy was close to healthy controls (P>0.05), but their functioning was still significantly reduced (P<0.05). In addition, the number of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes increased significantly in AML patients with increased peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, and in ALL patients without increased WBCs. These results suggest that cellular immunity may respond to AML and ALL, but that lymphocyte cytotoxicity remains impaired. Dysfunction of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes in AML and ALL patients may contribute to the failure of the host immune response against leukemic blasts.",,"['Guo, Wenjian', 'Xing, Chao', 'Dong, Aishu', 'Lin, Xiaoji', 'Lin, Ying', 'Zhu, Baoling', 'He, Muqing', 'Yao, Rongxing']","['Guo W', 'Xing C', 'Dong A', 'Lin X', 'Lin Y', 'Zhu B', 'He M', 'Yao R']","[""Department of Medicine; The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College; Wenzhou, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130805,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Perforin/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD3+CD56+ T lymphocyte', ""cell's cytotoxicity"", ""cell's number"", 'primary acute leukemia']",2013/09/14 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2013/09/14 06:00'],"['2013/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['25938 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.25938 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2013 Oct 1;14(10):916-21. doi: 10.4161/cbt.25938.

Sequencing of MDS genomes has identified mutations in genes implicated in RNA splicing, DNA modification, chromatin regulation, and cell signaling. We sequenced 111 genes across 738 patients with MDS or closely related neoplasms (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS-myeloproliferative neoplasms) to explore the role of acquired mutations in MDS biology and clinical phenotype. Seventy-eight percent of patients had 1 or more oncogenic mutations. We identify complex patterns of pairwise association between genes, indicative of epistatic interactions involving components of the spliceosome machinery and epigenetic modifiers. Coupled with inferences on subclonal mutations, these data suggest a hypothesis of genetic ""predestination,"" in which early driver mutations, typically affecting genes involved in RNA splicing, dictate future trajectories of disease evolution with distinct clinical phenotypes. Driver mutations had equivalent prognostic significance, whether clonal or subclonal, and leukemia-free survival deteriorated steadily as numbers of driver mutations increased.

We treated 8 patients with allogeneic (donor-derived) CD19.CAR-VSTs 3 months to 13 years after HSCT. There were no infusion-related toxicities. VSTs persisted for a median of 8 weeks in blood and up to 9 weeks at disease sites. Objective antitumor activity was evident in 2 of 6 patients with relapsed disease during the period of CD19.CAR-VST persistence, whereas 2 patients who received cells while in remission remain disease free. In 2 of 3 patients with viral reactivation, donor CD19.CAR-VSTs expanded concomitantly with VSTs. Hence CD19.CAR-VSTs display antitumor activity and, because their number may be increased in the presence of viral stimuli, earlier treatment post-HSCT (when lymphodepletion is greater and the incidence of viral infection is higher) or planned vaccination with viral antigens may enhance disease control.",,"['Cruz, Conrad Russell Y', 'Micklethwaite, Kenneth P', 'Savoldo, Barbara', 'Ramos, Carlos A', 'Lam, Sharon', 'Ku, Stephanie', 'Diouf, Oumar', 'Liu, Enli', 'Barrett, A John', 'Ito, Sawa', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Krance, Robert A', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Carrum, George', 'Hosing, Chitra M', 'Gee, Adrian P', 'Mei, Zhuyong', 'Grilley, Bambi J', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Rooney, Cliona M', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Bollard, Catherine M', 'Dotti, Gianpietro']","['Cruz CR', 'Micklethwaite KP', 'Savoldo B', 'Ramos CA', 'Lam S', 'Ku S', 'Diouf O', 'Liu E', 'Barrett AJ', 'Ito S', 'Shpall EJ', 'Krance RA', 'Kamble RT', 'Carrum G', 'Hosing CM', 'Gee AP', 'Mei Z', 'Grilley BJ', 'Heslop HE', 'Rooney CM', 'Brenner MK', 'Bollard CM', 'Dotti G']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/immunology', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation/virology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2013/09/14 06:00,2013/12/24 06:00,['2013/09/14 06:00'],"['2013/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36436-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-06-506741 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Oct 24;122(17):2965-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-06-506741.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can achieve cures in select patients and highlights the susceptibility of AML to donor-derived immunotherapy. The interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain (CD123) has been identified as a potential immunotherapeutic target because it is overexpressed in AML compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore, we developed 2 chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) containing a CD123-specific single-chain variable fragment, in combination with a CD28 costimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signaling domain, targeting different epitopes on CD123. CD123-CAR-redirected T cells mediated potent effector activity against CD123+ cell lines as well as primary AML patient samples. CD123 CAR T cells did not eliminate granulocyte/macrophage and erythroid colony formation in vitro. Additionally, T cells obtained from patients with active AML can be modified to express CD123 CARs and are able to lyse autologous AML blasts in vitro.

Here we identify a novel synergistic interaction between the small-molecule second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) mimetic BV6, which antagonizes X-linked IAP, cellular IAP (cIAP)1 and cIAP2, and the demethylating agents 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) to induce cell death in AML cells, including apoptosis-resistant cells. Calculation of combination index (CI) confirms that this drug combination is highly synergistic (CI 0.02-0.4). In contrast, BV6 and DAC at equimolar concentrations do not cause synergistic toxicity against normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, pointing to some tumor cell selectivity. Molecular studies reveal that BV6 and DAC cooperate to trigger the activation of caspases, mitochondrial perturbations and DNA fragmentation, consistent with apoptotic cell death. However, the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) fails to protect against BV6/DAC-induced cell death and even significantly increases the percentage of Annexin-V/propidium iodide double-positive cells. Importantly, BV6/DAC-induced cell death in the presence of zVAD.fmk is significantly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of key components of necroptosis signaling, that is, receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 1 using necrostatin-1 or mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) using necrosulfonamide. This indicates a switch from BV6/DAC-induced cell death from apoptosis to necroptosis upon caspase inhibition. Thus, BV6 cooperates with demethylating agents to induce cell death in AML cells and circumvents apoptosis resistance via a switch to necroptosis as an alternative mode of cell death. The identification of a novel synergism of BV6 and demethylating agents has important implications for the development of new treatment strategies for AML.",,"['Steinhart, L', 'Belz, K', 'Fulda, S']","['Steinhart L', 'Belz K', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130912,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (BV6 peptide)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,,2013/09/14 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/09/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013320 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.320 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Sep 12;4:e802. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.320.,PMC3789178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous British analyses have been area based and consequently thought to be less effective than case-control studies. METHODS: Cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LNHL) born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 2007, with matched cancer-free controls, were analysed by logistic regression to estimate the risk of residential proximity at birth and diagnosis to the nearest NPP, adjusting for relevant variables. RESULTS: For 9821 children with LNHL under the age of 5 years, the estimated extra risk associated with residential proximity to an NPP at birth was negative-interpolated Odds Ratio (OR) at 5 km was 0.86 (0.49-1.52). The comparison of 10 618 children with LNHL under five with 16 760 similarly aged children with other cancers also gave a negative estimate of the extra risk of residential proximity at diagnosis-interpolated OR at 5 km was 0.86 (0.62-1.18). CONCLUSION: Our results show little evidence of an increase in risk of LNHL to children aged under 5 years from living in the vicinity of an NPP.

MiR-100 and miR-99a have been reported to be aberrantly expressed in acute leukaemia. In this study, we focused on their functions in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and the molecular networks in which they are involved. METHODS: MiR-100 and miR-99a expression levels were measured in acute leukaemia patients by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to calculate the survival rate. Three human ALL cell lines were studied. Apoptosis and proliferation were analysed using siRNA transfection, western blot and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In vivo, miR-100 and miR-99a were down-regulated in 111 ALL patients, especially in high-risk groups; their expression levels were correlated with the patient's 5-year survival. In vitro, the restoration of miR-100 and miR-99a in ALL cells suppressed cell proliferation and increased dexamethasone-induced cell apoptosis. Ectopic expression of miR-100 and miR-99a targeted FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) and, in turn, influenced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity. Meanwhile, miR-100 and miR-99a overexpression inhibited the expression of IGF1R and mTOR and their downstream oncogene MCL1. CONCLUSION: MiR-100 and miR-99a have critical roles in altering cellular processes by targeting both the FKBP51 and IGF1R/mTOR signalling pathways in vitro and might represent a potential novel strategy for ALL treatment.",,"['Li, X-J', 'Luo, X-Q', 'Han, B-W', 'Duan, F-T', 'Wei, P-P', 'Chen, Y-Q']","['Li XJ', 'Luo XQ', 'Han BW', 'Duan FT', 'Wei PP', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130912,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (MIRN100 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN99 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (tacrolimus binding protein 5)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,2013/09/14 06:00,2014/01/18 06:00,['2013/09/14 06:00'],"['2013/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2013562 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2013.562 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2013 Oct 15;109(8):2189-98. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2013.562.

METHODS: Ninety-three leukemia patients underwent allogeneic HSCT were divided into two groups: 51 cases of RD-HSCT and 42 cases of URD-HSCT. In the RD-HSCT group, a preconditioning regimen with fludarabine (Flu) + busulfan (Bu) + cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) was used in 42 patients and total body irradiation (TBI) + Flu + Ara-C was used in the remaining 9. RESULTS: In the URD-HSCT group, a modified preconditioning regimen with Bu + cyclophosphamide was used in 35 patients, while the other 7 patients underwent treatment with TBI + Flu. After transplantation, the occurrence rate of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 46.0 and 51.2% in the two groups. Likewise, the rate of chronic GVHD was 46.0 and 63.4%, respectively. No significant differences in the occurrence of acute and chronic GVHD were detected between the two groups. The differences in early-stage infection rate after transplantation, recurrence rate, 3-year survival rate, and disease-free survival rate between the two groups were not significant. CONCLUSION: HLA-haploidentical RD-HSCT with enhanced preconditioning and administration of immunosuppressants showed a clinical efficacy similar to that of URD-HSCT against leukemia, without the risk of increased infection and GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Recently, cancer diagnostics and treatment have benefited from the development of nanobiocomposites, in which metallic or magnetic nanoparticles are conjugated with specific biomolecules for selective cell uptake. Despite recent advances in this area, the biomedical applications of these materials are still limited by the low efficiency of functionalization, low stability, among other factors. In this study, we report the synthesis of jacalin-conjugated gold nanoparticles, a nanoconjugate with potential application in medical areas, especially for cancer diagnosis. Jacalin is a lectin protein and it was employed due to its ability to recognize the Galbeta1-3GalNAc disaccharide, which is highly expressed in tumor cells. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized in the presence of generation 4 polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM G4) and conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled jacalin. The AuNPs/jacalin nanoconjugates were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and vibrational spectroscopy (FTIR). We also performed an investigation using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence quenching measurements to understand the interactions occurring between the AuNPs and jacalin, which revealed that the nanoconjugate formation is driven by an entropic process with good affinity. Furthermore, in vitro tests revealed that the AuNPs/jacalin-FITC nanoconjugates exhibited higher affinity for leukemic K562 cells than for healthy mononuclear blood cells, which could be useful for biomedical applications, including cancer cells imaging.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, current MRD analysis methods, both molecular genetic and flow cytometric, are time-consuming and require experienced laboratory staff. METHODS: To reduce the demands of flow cytometric MRD detection in CLL, we have introduced a novel flow cytometric 8-color protocol. The MRD analysis results using this protocol were then compared with the commonly employed 4-color protocol and the molecular genetic (real-time quantitative allele-specific oligonucleotide IGH polymerase chain reaction; RQ-ASO IGH PCR) approach. RESULTS: Forty-two CLL patient samples were repeatedly analyzed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 20) or after fludarabine-based therapy (n = 22), and 100% concordance was found using both flow cytometric protocols. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between flow cytometric and RQ-ASO IGH PCR results in MRD detection. CONCLUSION: Flow cytometry is less time-consuming, less financially demanding, and moreover, MRD assessment using our novel 8-color protocol is less complicated than the 4-color approach and molecular methods.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Stehlikova, O', 'Chovancova, J', 'Tichy, B', 'Krejci, M', 'Brychtova, Y', 'Panovska, A', 'Francova Skuhrova, H', 'Burckova, K', 'Borsky, M', 'Loja, T', 'Mayer, J', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Doubek, M']","['Stehlikova O', 'Chovancova J', 'Tichy B', 'Krejci M', 'Brychtova Y', 'Panovska A', 'Francova Skuhrova H', 'Burckova K', 'Borsky M', 'Loja T', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S', 'Doubek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, Brno and Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130913,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease']",2013/09/14 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2013/09/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12149 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Apr;36(2):165-71. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12149.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine, promotes transendothelial migration by upregulating endothelial expression of inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, a chemokine implicated in GBS. We sought to determine the mechanism by which TNF-alpha induces expression and secretion of CCL2 from peripheral nerve microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells (PNMECs). Expression of CCL2 mRNA and protein in quiescent PNMEC cultures was minimal. In contrast, cultures treated with TNF-alpha exhibited increased CCL2 mRNA and protein content, as well as protein secretion. Simvastatin significantly attenuated TNF-alpha-induced CCL2 secretion without affecting CCL2 mRNA or protein expression. Co-incubation with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate, prevented the effect of simvastatin. By comparison, inhibiting protein isoprenylation with GGTI-298, but not FTI-277, mimicked the effect of simvastatin and significantly attenuated transendothelial migration in vitro. Inhibition of the monomeric GTPase Cdc42, but not Rac1 or RhoA-C, attenuated TNF-alpha-mediated CCL2 secretion. TNF-alpha-mediated trafficking of autoreactive leukocytes into peripheral nerves during GBS may proceed by a mechanism that involves Cdc42-facilitated secretion of CCL2.","['Published 2013.

CLL cells show an antiapoptotic profile, suggesting the important role of apoptosis inhibition in the disease development. However, there is some population of proliferating CLL cells, which may also play a role in progression of the disease. There are several newer, biological prognostic factors in CLL. Currently, cytogenetic abnormalities with different prognostic values seem to be the most biologically relevant. During the last decades, the treatment of CLL has been significantly changed. Different strategies such as monotherapy with chlorambucil and purine nucleoside analogues (PNA) used alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide have been introduced. Most recently, immunochemotherapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, became a gold standard of first-line treatment in eligible CLL patients. Currently, new treatment strategies including new monoclonal antibodies, bendamustine, lenalidomide, or inhibitors of several cell signaling pathways are under clinical studies in resistant/relapsed CLL patients. Moreover, allogeneic stem cell transplantation has to be considered, especially in younger high risk patients, for example, those who are resistant to PNA or those with 17p deletion.

HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax is known to cause permanent activation of many cellular transcription factors including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Here, we show that NF-kappaB-binding cofactor inhibitor of NF-kappaB-zeta (IkappaB-zeta) is constitutively expressed in HTLV-I-infected T cell lines and ATL cells, and Tax transactivates the IkappaB-zeta gene, mainly through NF-kappaB. Microarray analysis of IkappaB-zeta-expressing uninfected T cells demonstrated that IkappaB-zeta induced the expression of NF-kappaB. and interferon-regulatory genes such as B cell CLL/lymphoma 3 (Bcl3), guanylate-binding protein 1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. The transcriptional activation domain, nuclear localization signal, and NF-kappaB-binding domain of IkappaB-zeta were required for Bcl3 induction, and IkappaB-zeta synergistically enhanced Tax-induced Bcl3 transactivation in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Interestingly, IkappaB-zeta inhibited Tax-induced NF-kappaB, AP-1 activation, and HTLV-I transcription. Furthermore, IkappaB-zeta interacted with Tax in vitro and this interaction was also observed in an HTLV-I-transformed T cell line.

In a widely studied instance of this phenomenon, proinflammatory agents have been shown to cause retinal ganglion cells, the projection neurons of the eye, to regenerate lengthy axons through the injured optic nerve. However, the role of different molecules and cell populations in mediating this phenomenon remains unclear. We show here that neutrophils, the first responders of the innate immune system, play a central role in inflammation-induced regeneration. Numerous neutrophils enter the mouse eye within a few hours of inducing an inflammatory reaction and express high levels of the atypical growth factor oncomodulin (Ocm). Immunodepletion of neutrophils diminished Ocm levels in the eye without altering levels of CNTF, leukemia inhibitory factor, or IL-6, and suppressed the proregenerative effects of inflammation. A peptide antagonist of Ocm suppressed regeneration as effectively as neutrophil depletion. Macrophages enter the eye later in the inflammatory process but appear to be insufficient to stimulate extensive regeneration in the absence of neutrophils. These data provide the first evidence that neutrophils are a major source of Ocm and can promote axon regeneration in the CNS.",,"['Kurimoto, Takuji', 'Yin, Yuqin', 'Habboub, Ghaith', 'Gilbert, Hui-Ya', 'Li, Yiqing', 'Nakao, Shintaro', 'Hafezi-Moghadam, Ali', 'Benowitz, Larry I']","['Kurimoto T', 'Yin Y', 'Habboub G', 'Gilbert HY', 'Li Y', 'Nakao S', 'Hafezi-Moghadam A', 'Benowitz LI']","[""Laboratories for Neuroscience Research in Neurosurgery and F.M.

The objective of the present study was to determine if plasma levels of sIL-2R and B2M are markers of neurologic disease in individuals infected with HTLV-1. The present study was divided into two parts. A cross-sectional study and a nested case control study. In the cross-sectional study, HAM/TSP patients had higher plasma levels of B2M and sIL-2R than patients with overactive bladder and HTLV-1 carriers (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). For the nested case control study, the sIL-2 receptor test was able to distinguish patients with HAM/TSP from patients in the combined group of carriers and patients with overactive bladder with a sensitivity of 75.8% and false positive rate of 25.4%. Plasma levels of these markers did not change with the development of HAM/TSP and overactive bladder in HTLV-1 carrier patients.

The effect of time since an intermediate event has been accommodated either by changing the time scale to time since entry to the new state ('clock-back' approach) or by including the time at entry to the new state as a covariate. In this paper, we argue that the choice of time scale for the various transitions in a multi-state model should be dealt with as an empirical question, as also the question of whether a single time scale is sufficient. We illustrate that these questions are best addressed by using parametric models for the transition rates, as opposed to the traditional Cox-model-based approaches. Specific advantages are that dependence of failure rates on multiple time scales can be made explicit and described in informative graphical displays. Using a single common time scale for all transitions greatly facilitates computations of probabilities of being in a particular state at a given time, because the machinery from the theory of Markov chains can be applied. However, a realistic model for transition rates is preferable, especially when the focus is not on prediction of final outcomes from start but on the analysis of instantaneous risk or on dynamic prediction. We illustrate the various approaches using a data set from stem cell transplant in leukemia and provide supplementary online material in R.","['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Iacobelli, Simona', 'Carstensen, Bendix']","['Iacobelli S', 'Carstensen B']","['Centro Interdipartimentale di Biostatistica e Bioinformatica, Universita Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Chronic Malignancies Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Leiden, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130912,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', '*Markov Chains', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/standards', '*Models, Statistical', 'Recurrence', '*Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Poisson model', 'flexible parametric models', 'multi-state', 'time scales', 'time-dependent covariate']",2013/09/13 06:00,2014/08/05 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.5976 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2013 Dec 30;32(30):5315-27. doi: 10.1002/sim.5976.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the role of oncostatin M (OSM) in osteoarthritis (OA) by evaluating the presence of the cytokine and its receptors in the OA joint and interfering with its activity in synovial fluid co-cultured with cartilage explants. OSM levels were increased in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic patients compared to healthy donors. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of both the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and OSM receptors for OSM throughout the whole depth of osteoarthritic cartilage and synovial tissue, whereas in healthy cartilage their presence seemed more restricted to the superficial zone. Blocking OSM activity, using an activity inhibiting antibody, in 25 % osteoarthritic synovial fluid added to OA cartilage explant cultures increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content from 18.6 mg/g to 24.3 mg/g (P < 0.03) and total production from 7.0 mg/g to 11.9 mg/g (P < 0.003). However, OSM exogenously added to cartilage explant cultures reflecting low and high concentrations in the synovial fluid (5 and 50 pg/mL) did not affect cartilage matrix turnover, suggesting that factors present in the synovial fluid act in concert with OSM to inhibit GAG production.

The aim of this study was to develop a disease-specific HRQOL questionnaire for patients with CML to supplement the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ C30. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The process followed a predefined and systematic stepwise iterative process as defined by the EORTC guidelines for questionnaire development. The process was divided into 3 phases: (1) generation of relevant HRQOL issues, (2) operationalization of the HRQOL issues into a set of items, and (3) pretesting the questionnaire for relevance and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and psychometric analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Overall, 655 CML patients were enrolled in 10 countries including the USA and countries in Europe and Asia. Interviews with health-care professionals experienced in CML (n = 59) were also conducted. Results from the interviews, clinical experiences, and statistical analyses were used to develop the EORTC QLQ-CML24. The final module consists of 24 items assessing the following aspects: symptom burden, impact on daily life and on worry/mood, body image problems, and satisfaction with care and with social life. Internal consistency, assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficients, ranged from 0.73 to 0.83 for the proposed scales. CONCLUSION: The EORTC QLQ-CML24 is an internationally developed HRQOL questionnaire for CML patients, and its implementation in clinical research and practice can provide important information to facilitate clinical decision-making.",,"['Efficace, Fabio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Abel, Gregory', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Cocks, Kim', 'Naeem, Adel', 'Sprangers, Mirjam', 'Oerlemans, Simone', 'Chie, Weichu', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Bombaci, Felice', 'Sharf, Giora', 'Cardoni, Annarita', 'Noens, Lucien', 'Pallua, Stephan', 'Salvucci, Marzia', 'Nicolatou-Galitis, Ourania', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Efficace F', 'Baccarani M', 'Breccia M', 'Saussele S', 'Abel G', 'Caocci G', 'Guilhot F', 'Cocks K', 'Naeem A', 'Sprangers M', 'Oerlemans S', 'Chie W', 'Castagnetti F', 'Bombaci F', 'Sharf G', 'Cardoni A', 'Noens L', 'Pallua S', 'Salvucci M', 'Nicolatou-Galitis O', 'Rosti G', 'Mandelli F']","['Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases GIMEMA, Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Via Benevento, 6, 00161, Rome, Italy, f.efficace@gimema.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130913,Netherlands,Qual Life Res,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",9210257,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*International Cooperation', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Psychometrics/*instrumentation', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Social Class', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/09/13 06:00,2014/10/05 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11136-013-0523-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Qual Life Res. 2014 Apr;23(3):825-36. doi: 10.1007/s11136-013-0523-5.

In the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), miR-15a and miR-16-1 play an important role. These miRNAs are located on chromosome 13 in the 13q14.3 region, which is deleted in more than 55% of CLL patients. This aberration affects expression of miRNAs. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed at performing a molecular genetic analysis of miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression in a group of 39 patients diagnosed with CLL and determining the association between the expression of the two miRNAs and types of deletions in the 13q14 region. METHODS: We used fluorescence in situ hybridiziation (FISH) for determination of mono- or biallelic deletion 13q and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) to revealed expression miR-15a and miR-16-1 in 39 patients suffering from CLL. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 19 patients with monoallelic 13q14 deletion, 3 patients with biallelic deletion, 9 patients with both monoallelic and biallelic deletions, and 8 patients without 13q14 deletion serving as controls. The results showed different levels of miRNA expression in individual patients. Significantly higher normalized levels of miR-15a expression were found in the control group and patients with monoallelic 13q14 expression compared with patients with biallelic deletion. There was a significantly decreased expression of both miRNAs in patients with biallelic deletion of the 13q14 region but only when deletions were present in 77% or more of cells, as detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).",,"['Humplikova, Lenka', 'Kollinerova, Sona', 'Papajik, Tomas', 'Pikalova, Zuzana', 'Holzerova, Milena', 'Prochazka, Vit', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Modriansky, Martin', 'Indrak, Karel', 'Jarosova, Marie']","['Humplikova L', 'Kollinerova S', 'Papajik T', 'Pikalova Z', 'Holzerova M', 'Prochazka V', 'Divoka M', 'Modriansky M', 'Indrak K', 'Jarosova M']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130905,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,"['0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged']",,,2013/09/13 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2013.057 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2013 Dec;157(4):284-93. doi: 10.5507/bp.2013.057.

Moreover, Brazilian race is very heterogeneous and is made by the confluence of people of several different origins, from the original Native Brazilians, with the influx of Portuguese colonizers, Black African slaves, and recent European, Arab and Japanese immigration. The purpose of this prospective, multicentric study was to assess the sociodemographic, clinic and cytogenetic characteristics of the children treated for ALL in the Northeast region of Brazil. RESULTS: This study includes thirty patients between 4 months and 17 years old treated for ALL from January 1st, 2009 to November 30th, 2010. Cytogenetic analysis showed that in nineteen out of thirty patients (64%) presented some chromosome abnormalities, in which 53% corresponds to numerical abnormalities, 21% structural and numerical abnormalities, and 26% only structural changes. Moreover, seven patients presented complexes karyotype not yet described in the literature. Taken together these results show the importance of the cytogenetic analysis in ALL pediatric patients and illustrates that the studied population presented unexpected complexes karyotypes which were correlated to poor outcome.

This has resulted in an increase in the incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), which is one of the leading causes of non-relapse mortality. Several observational studies have linked the development of t-MN after ASCT with the intensity and frequency of chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents, use of total body irradiation (TBI), and peripheral blood progenitor cells. In addition, role of genetic factors is increasingly being identified. It is postulated that the use of chemotherapy prior to ASCT results in DNA damage of progenitor cells, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered gene expression related to DNA repair, metabolism as well as hematopoietic regulation. Cytogenetic studies have shown the presence of abnormalities in the peripheral blood progenitor cells prior to ASCT. It is, therefore, likely that the reinfusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells, proliferative stress on infused progenitor cells during hematopoietic regeneration and associated telomere shortening ultimately result in clonal hematopoiesis and blastic transformation. Cytopenias, myelodysplasia, or cytogenetic abnormalities are common and can be transient after ASCT; therefore, only when present together, they do confirm the diagnosis of t-MN. Attempts to reduce the occurrence of t-MN should be directed toward minimizing the exposure to the identified risk factors. Although the median survival is few months to less than a year, studies have shown the promising role of allogeneic transplantation in select young t-MN patients without high-risk cytogenetics. In this review we will explain the recent findings in the field of t-MN in lymphoma patients that have implications for identifying the molecular and genetic mechanisms of leukemogenesis and discuss potential strategies to reduce the risk of t-MN in this patient population.",,"['Akhtari, Mojtaba', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj', 'Tandra, Pavan Kumar', 'Krishnamurthy, Jairam', 'Horstman, Heidi', 'Dreessen, Amy', 'Chen, Pei Xian', 'Armitage, James O']","['Akhtari M', 'Bhatt VR', 'Tandra PK', 'Krishnamurthy J', 'Horstman H', 'Dreessen A', 'Chen PX', 'Armitage JO']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology; Department of Internal Medicine; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Omaha, NE USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131018,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/genetics', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin lymphoma', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'myelodysplasia', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'therapy-related myeloid neoplasms']",2013/09/13 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['26342 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.26342 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2013 Dec;14(12):1077-88. doi: 10.4161/cbt.26342.

Pre-treatment of anoikis-resistant cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) for 24 h increased the levels of toxic BH3 domain proteins, reduced MCL-1 levels, and restored/re-sensitized the cell death response of AR tumor cells to multiple toxic therapies.

Cancer cell survival is dependent upon up-regulation of the pro-survival response, mediated by anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1. RESULTS: Here we show that over-expression of Mcl-1 in pancreatic patient tumor samples is linked to advancement of the disease. We have previously shown that triptolide, a diterpene triepoxide, is effective both in vitro and in vivo, in killing pancreatic cancer cells. Decrease of Mcl-1 levels, either by siRNA or by treatment with triptolide results in cell death. Using pancreatic cancer cell lines, we have shown that miR-204, a putative regulator of Mcl-1, is repressed in cancer cell lines compared to normal cells. Over-expression of miR-204, either by a miR-204 mimic, or by triptolide treatment results in a decrease in Mcl-1 levels, and a subsequent decrease in cell viability. Using luciferase reporter assays, we confirmed the ability of miR-204 to down-regulate Mcl-1 by directly binding to the Mcl-1 3' UTR. Using human xenograft samples treated with Minnelide, a water soluble variant of triptolide, we have shown that miR-204 is up-regulated and Mcl-1 is down-regulated in treated vs. control tumors.

METHODS: Two tantalus and 2 patas monkeys were transfused with intraspecies whole blood infected with STLV-1. Infection was determined by ELISA, western blot and DNA PCR analyses. The entire genome of the STLV-1 Tan 90 strain and some of the STVL-1 Pat74 strain were amplified using over-lapping primer-pairs and subsequently sequenced. RESULTS: Followup studies conducted over 2 years indicated that all 4 monkeys remained healthy despite being infected with STLV-1, as determined by PCR, cloning and sequencing analyses. ELISA and Western blot analyses indicated that both patas monkeys seroconverted within 2 months of transfusion, while one tantalus monkey required one year to seroconvert and the other never fully seroconverted. The tantalus monkey which never fully seroconverted, failed to react to HTLV-1 p24 Gag antigen. Sequence analyses indicated that, while unique, the deduced p24 Gag amino acid sequence of the STLV-1 Tan 90 strain used for infection was still highly homologous to the HTLV-1 p24 Gag amino acids present in the ELISA and WB assays. However, a mutation in the pol sequence of STLV-1 Tan 90 encoded a putative stop codon, while a common deletion in the pol/rex regulatory gene causes significant changes in the Pol, and p27 Rex proteins. These same mutations were also observed in the viral DNA of both recipient infected tantalus monkeys and were not present in the STLV-1 Pat 74 strain. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that seroconversion to STLV-1 infection may be prolonged due to the above mutations, and that compensatory molecular events must have occurred to allow for virus transmission.",,"['Dube, Syamalima', 'Saksena, Nitin', 'Spicer, Timothy', 'Healey, Jayne', 'Benz, Patricia', 'Dube, Dipak K', 'Poiesz, Bernard J']","['Dube S', 'Saksena N', 'Spicer T', 'Healey J', 'Benz P', 'Dube DK', 'Poiesz BJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, State University of New York, Upstate Medical University, 750 East Adams Street, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA. poieszb@upstate.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130911,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.48 (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Asymptomatic Diseases', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Genes, pX/*genetics/*immunology', 'Haplorhini', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monkey Diseases/virology', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/immunology', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/*genetics/*immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology']",,,2013/09/13 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/09/13 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-10-282 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-10-282 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2013 Sep 11;10:282. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-10-282.,PMC3851238,,"['5-V01-AI-27658/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-43602-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS & METHODS: In the current study, we sequenced the genes RRM1 and RRM2 in genomic DNA from HapMap cell lines with European (Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry [CEU]; n = 90) or African (Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria [YRI]; n = 90) ancestry. RESULTS: We identified 44 genetic variants including eight coding SNPs in RRM1 and 15 SNPs including one coding SNP in RRM2. RRM1 and RRM2 mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with each other in both CEU and YRI lymphoblast cell lines, and in leukemic blasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (AML97, n = 89; AML02, n = 187). Additionally, RRM1 expression was higher among patient features indicative of a high relapse hazard. We evaluated SNPs within the RRM1 and RRM2 genes in the HapMap lymphoblast cell lines from CEU and YRI panels for association with expression and cytarabine chemosensitivity. SNPs of potential significance were further evaluated in AML patients. RRM1 SNPs rs1042919 (which occurs in linkage disequilbrium with multiple other SNPs) and promoter SNP rs1561876 were associated with intracellular 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-CTP levels, response after remission induction therapy, risk of relapse and overall survival in AML patients receiving cytarabine and cladribine.

Our aim was to address that question by surveying the autophagic activity in parental acute myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and resistant sub cell line, K562/ADM, which were obtained by treating adriamycin with increasing concentrations. K562/ADM and K562 cells were exposed to PBS culture medium for 3 hours, then the stress-induced autophagy was measured. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed the expression of LC3 mRNA was higher in K562/ADM than in K562 cells. LC3-II, as an autophagosomal marker, was more abundant in K562/ADM than in K562 cells measured by Western blotting. To determine the effect of 3-MA, a known specific inhibitor of autophagy, on overcoming acquired multidrug resistance induced by adriamycin, the MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed. We also found that 3-MA can enhance the growth inhibition and apoptotic effect of adriamycin in acquired resistant cells (K562/ADM).

The current study of the metabolic actions of JS-K was undertaken to investigate mechanisms of its cytotoxicity. Consistent with model chemical reactions, the activating step in the metabolism of JS-K in the cell is the dearylation of the diazeniumdiolate by glutathione (GSH) via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The resulting product (CEP/NO anion) spontaneously hydrolyzes, releasing two equivalents of NO. The GSH/GSSG redox couple is considered to be the major redox buffer of the cell, helping maintain a reducing environment under basal conditions. We have quantified the effects of JS-K on cellular GSH content, and show that JS-K markedly depletes GSH, due to JS-K's rapid uptake and cascading release of NO and reactive nitrogen species. The depletion of GSH results in alterations in the redox potential of the cellular environment, initiating MAPK stress signaling pathways, and inducing apoptosis. Microarray analysis confirmed signaling gene changes at the transcriptional level and revealed alteration in the expression of several genes crucial for maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, as well as cell proliferation and survival, including MYC. Pre-treating cells with the known GSH precursor and nucleophilic reducing agent N-acetylcysteine prevented the signaling events that lead to apoptosis. These data indicate that multiplicative depletion of the reduced glutathione pool and deregulation of intracellular redox balance are important initial steps in the mechanism of JS-K's cytotoxic action.",,"['Maciag, Anna E', 'Holland, Ryan J', 'Robert Cheng, Y-S', 'Rodriguez, Luis G', 'Saavedra, Joseph E', 'Anderson, Lucy M', 'Keefer, Larry K']","['Maciag AE', 'Holland RJ', 'Robert Cheng YS', 'Rodriguez LG', 'Saavedra JE', 'Anderson LM', 'Keefer LK']","['Basic Science Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130201,Netherlands,Redox Biol,Redox biology,101605639,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)', '1-((4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Reactive Nitrogen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Azo Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Piperazines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Reactive Nitrogen Species/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATF, activating transcription factor', 'Arylated diazeniumdiolate', ""DAF-FM, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate"", ""DCF-DA, 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate"", 'DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'GSH, glutathione', 'GSSG, glutathione disulfide (oxidized GSH)', 'Glutathione', ""HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution"", 'IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis', 'JS-K, O2-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)', '1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate', 'LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry', 'Leukemia', 'MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'NAC, N-acetylcysteine', 'NO, nitric oxide', 'NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer', 'Nitric oxide', 'PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase', 'RNS, reactive nitrogen species', 'ROS, reactive oxygen species', 'SAPK/JNK, stress activated protein kinase/c-jun N-terminal kinase.']",2013/09/12 06:00,2013/09/12 06:01,['2013/09/12 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.redox.2012.12.002 [doi]', 'REDOX16 [pii]']",epublish,Redox Biol. 2013 Feb 1;1:115-24. doi: 10.1016/j.redox.2012.12.002. eCollection 2013.,PMC3757670,,"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20130911'],,

We present the case of a 76-year-old gentleman with a previous diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia who presented with fatigue, fever, and a white blood cell count of 500 000 with prolymphocytes on peripheral blood examination. Chlorambucil and dexamethasone were initiated. He developed progressive anemia during his admission with no clear cause on initial CT examination. Bilateral hip pain began several days later and he was unfortunately diagnosed with a large spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage postmortem. This condition is rare and generally occurs in those receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or dialysis, with known bleeding disorders or vascular malformation, none of which were present in our patient. Pathology revealed marked leukemoid engorgement of the vessels of many organs with prolymphocytes.

Inflammation-associated genetic variants have been highly associated with cancer risk. Polymorphisms in the gene cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a pro-inflammation factor, have been suggested to alter the risk of multiple tumors, but the findings of various studies are not consistent. METHODS: A literature search through February 2013 was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI databases. We used odds ratios (ORs) with confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% to assess the strength of the association between the COX-2-765G>C polymorphism and cancer risk in a random-effect model. We also assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS: In total, 65 articles with 29,487 cancer cases and 39,212 non-cancer controls were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR (95% CIs) in the co-dominant model (GC vs. GG) was 1.11 (1.02-1.22), and in the dominant model ((CC+GC) vs. GG), the pooled OR was 1.12 (1.02-1.23). In the subgroup analysis, stratified by cancer type and race, significant associations were found between the-765 C allele and higher risk for gastric cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and cancer in the Asian population. CONCLUSION: In summary, the COX-2-765 C allele was related to increased cancer susceptibility, especially gastric cancer and cancer in the Asian population.",,"['Wang, Xiao-feng', 'Huang, Ming-zhu', 'Zhang, Xiao-wei', 'Hua, Rui-xi', 'Guo, Wei-jian']","['Wang XF', 'Huang MZ', 'Zhang XW', 'Hua RX', 'Guo WJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130904,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)'],IM,"['Cyclooxygenase 2/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,,2013/09/12 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/09/12 06:00'],"['2013/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0073213 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-23374 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Sep 4;8(9):e73213. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0073213. eCollection 2013.,PMC3762903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our solution is based on an [Formula: see text] regularized logistic regression model that aggregates AML test statistics calculated from individual test tubes with different cell populations and fluorescent markers. The model construction is entirely data driven and no prior biological knowledge is used. The described solution scored a 100% classification accuracy in the DREAM6/FlowCAP2 Molecular Classification of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Challenge against a golden standard consisting of 20 AML-positive and 160 healthy patients. Here we perform a more extensive validation of the prediction model performance and further improve and simplify our original method showing that statistically equal results can be obtained by using simple average marker intensities as features in the logistic regression model. In addition to the logistic regression based model, we also present other classification models and compare their performance quantitatively.

Apoptotic cells were determined by fluorescence microscopy and FACS after staining with AO and EB or PI, respectively. The cleavage of PARP and the activation of Bax and the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins were determined by Western Blot. siRNA was used to silence the expression of target genes. Primary cells were isolated following Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation method. RESULTS: HT inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis of NB4 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis induced by HT was correlated with the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and the cleavage of PARP, while HT did not affect the protein level of Bax and Bak or change the protein level of Bcl-2.

The cellular effects of 6-MP on metabolism remain unknown; however, 6-MP was recently found to activate the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A3 in skeletal muscle cell lines. We have reported previously that NR4A3 (also known as NOR-1, MINOR) is a positive regulator of insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. To further explore the role of NR4A3 activation in insulin action, we explored whether 6-MP activation of NR4A3 could modulate glucose transport system activity in L6 skeletal muscle cells. We found that 6-MP increased both NR4A3 expression and NR4A3 transcriptional activity and enhanced glucose transport activity via increasing GLUT4 translocation in both basal and insulin-stimulated L6 cells in an NR4A3-dependent manner. Furthermore, 6-MP increased levels of phospho-AS160, although this effect was not modulated by NR4A3 overexpression or knockdown. These primary findings provide a novel proof of principle that 6-MP, a small molecule NR4A3 agonist, can augment glucose uptake in insulin target cells, although this occurs via both NR4A3-dependent and -independent actions; the latter is related to an increase in phospho-AS160.

Our previous studies, and studies by others, have reported that vitamin C at concentrations of 0.25-1.0 mM induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and in leukemic cells from peripheral blood specimens obtained from patients with AML.

We found that i.) OCT4-expressing cells dramatically decrease during the first week of differentiation, ii.) the number of OCT4-expressing cells recovers from day 7 on, iii.) the OCT4-expressing cells are similar to embryonic stem cells grown in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor LIF but express several markers associated with germ cell formation, such as DAZL and STRA-8 and iv.) the persistence of potentially pluripotent cells is independent of supportive cells in EBs. Finally, OCT4-expressing cells, isolated from EBs after 2-month of culture, were further maintained under feeder-free conditions in absence of LIF and continued to express OCT4 in 95 % of the population for at least 36 days.

METHODS: The characteristics and outcomes of untreated African American (AA) patients with CLL (n = 84) were analyzed and compared with a reference nonblack (NB) patient population (n = 1571). RESULTS: At the time of presentation, AA patients had lower median hemoglobin levels (12.9 g/dL vs 13.7 g/dL), higher beta2 microglobulin levels (2.7 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL), greater frequency of constitutional symptoms (27% vs 10%), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutation status (65% vs 47%), zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression (58% vs 32%), and deletion of chromosome 17p or chromosome 11q (28% vs 17%; P </= 02 for each comparison). Fifty-one percent of AA patients and 39% of NB patients required first-line therapy and 91% and 88%, respectively, received chemoimmunotherapy. Overall response rates to treatment were 85% for AA patients and 94% for NB patients (P = .06); and the complete response rates were 56% and 58%, respectively (P = .87). The median survival of AA patients was shorter compared with that of NB patients (event-free survival: 36 months vs 61 months; P = .007; overall survival: 152 months vs not reached; P = .0001).

Here we used a combined comparative genomics analysis and an in vivo transgenic zebrafish assay to identify six regulatory DNA elements that are able to direct green fluorescent protein expression in a spatiotemporal manner during zebrafish embryonic hematopoiesis. Analysis of chromatin characteristics and regulatory signatures suggests that many of these predicted elements are potential enhancers in mammalian hematopoiesis. Strikingly, one of the enhancer elements (E9) is a frequent integration site in retroviral-induced mouse acute leukemia. The genomic region corresponding to enhancer E9 is differentially marked by H3K4 monomethylation and H3K27 acetylation, hallmarks of active enhancers, in multiple leukemia cell lines. Decreased enrichment of these histone marks is associated with downregulation of MEIS1 expression during hematopoietic differentiation. Further, MEIS1/HOXA9 transactivate this enhancer via a conserved binding motif in vitro, and participate in an autoregulatory loop that modulates MEIS1 expression in vivo.

The heterogeneous composition of CAP offers the opportunity to mediate several signaling pathways that regulate tumor cells. Consequently, the array of CAP generated products has limited the identification of the mechanisms of action on tumor cells. The aim of this work is to assess the cell death response of human myeloid leukemia cells by remote exposure to CAP generated RNS by utilizing a novel resistive barrier discharge system that primarily produces RNS. The effect of variable treatments of CAP generated RNS was tested in THP-1 cell (human monocytic leukemia cell line), a model for hematological malignancy. The number of viable cells was evaluated with erythrosine-B staining, while apoptosis and necrosis was assessed by endonuclease cleavage observed by agarose gel electrophoresis and detection of cells with the exclusionary dye propidium iodide and fluorescently labeled annexin-V by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. Our observations indicate that treatment dosage levels of 45 s of exposure to CAP emitted RNS-induced apoptotic cell death and for higher dosage conditions of >/=50 s of exposure to CAP induced necrosis.

Interestingly, the T-cell subset expansion over time was more pronounced in CD38 + CLL. Additionally, we performed gene expression profiling of CD3 + T cells of CLL patients and normal donors. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found significant enrichment of genes with higher expression in CLL T cells within CD8+ effector memory and terminal effector T-cell gene signatures. In agreement with these data, we observed a marked expansion of phenotypic CD8 + effector memory T cells in CLL by flow cytometry. Moreover, we observed that increments of CD8 + effector memory T cells in human CLL and also mouse CLL (Emu-TCL1 model) were due to an expansion of the inhibitory killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) expressing cellular subset. Furthermore, higher plasma levels of the natural KLRG1 ligand E-cadherin were detected in CLL patients compared to normal donor controls.

Recently, there have been a number of studies on the association between Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) null genotype and childhood acute leukemia in Chinese, but the results of previous reports are inconsistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the effect of GSTM1 null genotype on childhood acute leukemia risk. PubMed, Embase, and Wanfang databases were searched to identify case-control studies investigating the association between GSTM1 null genotype and risk of childhood acute leukemia. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic method. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were pooled to assess the association. Seven case-control studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. There was no between-study heterogeneity among those seven studies (I2 = 0%). Overall, the GSTM1 null genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of childhood acute leukemia in Chinese (fixed effect OR = 2.49; 95% CI, 1.84-3.37; P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine associations between childhood cancers and traffic-related pollution exposure. METHODS: The present study included children < 6 years of age identified in the California Cancer Registry (born 1998-2007) who could be linked to a California birth certificate (n = 3,590). Controls were selected at random from California birthrolls (n = 80,224). CAlifornia LINE Source Dispersion Modeling, version 4 (CALINE4) was used to generate estimates of local traffic exposures for each trimester of pregnancy and in the first year of life at the address indicated on the birth certificate. We checked our findings by additionally examining associations with particulate matter (</= 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5) pollution measured by community-based air pollution monitors, and with a simple measure of traffic density. RESULTS: With unconditional logistic regression, a per interquartile range increase in exposure to traffic-related pollution during the first trimester (0.0538 ppm carbon monoxide, estimated using CALINE4) was associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL; first trimester odds ratio (OR) = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10]; germ cell tumors (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.29), particularly teratomas (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.41); and retinoblastoma (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.21), particularly bilateral retinoblastoma (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.33). Retinoblastoma was also associated with average PM2.5 concentrations during pregnancy, and ALL and teratomas were associated with traffic density near the child's residence at birth. CONCLUSIONS: We estimated weak associations between early exposure to traffic pollution and several childhood cancers. Because this is the first study to report on traffic pollution in relation to retinoblastoma or germ cell tumors, and both cancers are rare, these findings require replication in other studies.",,"['Heck, Julia E', 'Wu, Jun', 'Lombardi, Christina', 'Qiu, Jiaheng', 'Meyers, Travis J', 'Wilhelm, Michelle', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Ritz, Beate']","['Heck JE', 'Wu J', 'Lombardi C', 'Qiu J', 'Meyers TJ', 'Wilhelm M', 'Cockburn M', 'Ritz B']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130910,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Vehicle Emissions/analysis/*toxicity']",,,2013/09/12 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2013/09/12 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1306761 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2013 Nov-Dec;121(11-12):1385-91. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1306761.

Because excess free intracellular heme is toxic, organisms have developed mechanisms to tightly regulate its concentration. One mechanism is through active heme export by the group C feline leukemia virus receptor (FLVCR). Previously, we have shown that FLVCR is necessary for embryonic and postnatal erythropoiesis. However, FLVCR is also expressed in numerous other tissues, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To explore a possible role for FLVCR in HSC function, we performed serial, competitive repopulation transplant experiments using FLVCR-deleted and control bone marrow cells, along with wild-type competitor cells. Loss of FLVCR did not impact HSC function under steady-state or myelotoxic stress conditions (such as arsenic or radiation exposure), nor did FLVCR deletion result in alterations in the various progenitor compartments. However, even when 95% of the donor bone marrow cells lacked FLVCR, all red cells in recipient mice were wild type. This is due to the increased apoptosis of FLVCR-deleted proerythroblasts. Also, remarkably, loss of FLVCR increased megakaryocyte ploidy.

Mecom encodes EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1 (ME) proteins via alternative transcription start sites; these differ by the presence of a PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 (PR) domain with histone methyltransferase activity in the ME isoform. Using an ME-deficient mouse, we show that ME is required for MLL-AF9-induced transformation both in vitro and in vivo.

Acquired GATA1 mutations are present in both TAM and ML-DS. Current definitions of TAM specify neither the percentage of blasts nor the role of GATA1 mutation analysis. To define TAM, we prospectively analyzed clinical findings, blood counts and smears, and GATA1 mutation status in 200 DS neonates. All DS neonates had multiple blood count and smear abnormalities. Surprisingly, 195 of 200 (97.5%) had circulating blasts. GATA1 mutations were detected by Sanger sequencing/denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (Ss/DHPLC) in 17 of 200 (8.5%), all with blasts >10%. Furthermore low-abundance GATA1 mutant clones were detected by targeted next-generation resequencing (NGS) in 18 of 88 (20.4%; sensitivity approximately 0.3%) DS neonates without Ss/DHPLC-detectable GATA1 mutations. No clinical or hematologic features distinguished these 18 neonates. We suggest the term ""silent TAM"" for neonates with DS with GATA1 mutations detectable only by NGS. To identify all babies at risk of ML-DS, we suggest GATA1 mutation and blood count and smear analyses should be performed in DS neonates. Ss/DPHLC can be used for initial screening, but where GATA1 mutations are undetectable by Ss/DHPLC, NGS-based methods can identify neonates with small GATA1 mutant clones.",,"['Roberts, Irene', 'Alford, Kate', 'Hall, Georgina', 'Juban, Gaetan', 'Richmond, Helen', 'Norton, Alice', 'Vallance, Grant', 'Perkins, Kelly', 'Marchi, Emanuele', 'McGowan, Simon', 'Roy, Anindita', 'Cowan, Gillian', 'Anthony, Mark', 'Gupta, Amit', 'Ho, John', 'Uthaya, Sabita', 'Curley, Anna', 'Rasiah, Shree Vishna', 'Watts, Timothy', 'Nicholl, Richard', 'Bedford-Russell, Alison', 'Blumberg, Raoul', 'Thomas, Angela', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Halsey, Chris', 'Lee, Pek-Wan', 'Godambe, Sunit', 'Sweeney, Connor', 'Bhatnagar, Neha', 'Goriely, Anne', 'Campbell, Peter', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Roberts I', 'Alford K', 'Hall G', 'Juban G', 'Richmond H', 'Norton A', 'Vallance G', 'Perkins K', 'Marchi E', 'McGowan S', 'Roy A', 'Cowan G', 'Anthony M', 'Gupta A', 'Ho J', 'Uthaya S', 'Curley A', 'Rasiah SV', 'Watts T', 'Nicholl R', 'Bedford-Russell A', 'Blumberg R', 'Thomas A', 'Gibson B', 'Halsey C', 'Lee PW', 'Godambe S', 'Sweeney C', 'Bhatnagar N', 'Goriely A', 'Campbell P', 'Vyas P']","['Centre for Haematology, Hammersmith Campus, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130910,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Clone Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Down Syndrome/blood/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/diagnosis/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Neonatal Screening/methods', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism/pathology', 'Preleukemia/blood/diagnosis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2013/09/12 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2013/09/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36277-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-515148 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Dec 5;122(24):3908-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-515148.

Here, we investigated the phenotypic signature of T cells present at diagnosis in 39 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated within standardized ALL-BFM study protocols. Previously described age associations of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of healthy children were reproduced in leukemic bone marrow. Analysis of individual lymphocyte parameters and risk-associated variables using univariate linear regression models revealed a correlation of higher CD4/CD8 ratios at diagnosis with a favorable bone marrow response on day 15. Separate analysis of CD4(+) cells with the CD4(+)CD25(hi)FoxP3(+) T(reg) cell phenotype showed that the association was caused by non-T(reg) CD4(+) cells. The association of higher CD4/CD8 ratios with a favorable bone marrow response on day 15 of treatment persisted in a cohort extended to 69 patients. We conclude that CD4(+) non-T(reg) cells in leukemic bone marrow at diagnosis may have a role in early response to treatment.

Evidence suggests that Allium extracts have anti-cancer properties. However, the mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of A. cepa Linn are not fully elucidated in human cancer cells. In this study, we investigated anti-cancer effects of polyphenols extracted from lyophilized A. cepa Linn (PEAL) in human leukemia cells and their mechanisms. PEAL inhibited cancer cell growth by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. The apoptosis was suppressed by caspase 8 and 9 inhibitors. PEAL also up-regulated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor DR5 and down-regulated survivin and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP-1). We confirmed these findings in other leukemic cells (THP-1, K562 cells). In addition, PEAL suppressed Akt activity and the PEAL-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated in Akt-overexpressing U937 cells. In conclusion, our data suggested that PEAL induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in several human leukemic cells including U937 cells. The apoptosis was triggered through extrinsic pathway by up-regulating DR5 modulating as well as through intrinsic pathway by modulating IAP family members. In addition, PEAL induces caspase-dependent apoptosis at least in part through the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway.

RESULTS: As tested by colony-forming cell assays using clinical specimens, both number and size of total colonies derived from CD34(+) CML cells were significantly reduced by fenretinide, and by combining fenretinide with imatinib. In particular, colonies derived from erythroid progenitors and more primitive pluripotent/multipotent progenitors were highly sensitive to fenretinide/fenretinide plus imatinib. Accordantly, fenretinide appeared to induce apoptosis in CD34(+) CML cells, particularly with regard to the cells in the subpopulation of CD34(+)CD38(-). Through cell quiescent assays, including Ki-67 negativity test, we added evidence that nonproliferative CD34(+) CML cells were largely eliminated by fenretinide. Transcriptome and molecular data further showed that mechanisms underlying the apoptosis in CD34(+) CML cells were highly complex, involving multiple events of oxidative stress responses. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: As compared with CD34(+) AML cells, the apoptotic effects of fenretinide on CD34(+) CML cells were more prominent whereas less varied among the samples of different patients, and also various stress-responsive events appeared to be more robust in fenretinide-treated CD34(+) CML cells. Thus, the combination of fenretinide with imatinib may represent a more sophisticated strategy for CML treatment, in which imatinib mainly targets leukemic blast cells through the intrinsic pathway of apopotosis, whereas fenretinide primarily targets CML stem/progenitor cells through the oxidative/endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated pathway.",,"['Du, Yanzhi', 'Xia, Yuan', 'Pan, Xiaoling', 'Chen, Zi', 'Wang, Aihua', 'Wang, Kankan', 'Li, Junmin', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Du Y', 'Xia Y', 'Pan X', 'Chen Z', 'Wang A', 'Wang K', 'Li J', 'Zhang J']","['1 Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (SIBS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM) , Shanghai, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131024,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2013/09/12 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/09/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2012.4935 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2014 Apr 20;20(12):1866-80. doi: 10.1089/ars.2012.4935.

Recent advancements support the notion that aging is a highly regulated process governed by evolutionarily conserved pathways. In mammals, tissue-specific adult stem cells (ASCs) persist throughout the lifetime to maintain and repair tissues. While reduced ASC self-renewal is thought to contribute to compromised tissue maintenance, increased self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) may lead to tumorigenesis. It is speculated that genetic regulators of aging, such as sirtuins, are likely to impinge upon the ASC compartments to regulate tissue maintenance and tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss the emerging evidence linking sirtuins to normal and malignant ASC self-renewal, tissue maintenance, and tumorigenesis.",,"['Mohrin, Mary', 'Chen, Danica']","['Mohrin M', 'Chen D']","['University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)', 'hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell (LSC)', 'sirtuin']",2013/09/11 06:00,2013/09/11 06:01,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601912474930 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601912474930 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2013 Mar;4(3-4):76-81. doi: 10.1177/1947601912474930.,PMC3764468,,['R01 AG040990/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An antibody against SLMAP significantly promoted the phagocytosis of K562/ADR by macrophages in vitro.

In this study, we compared the outcomes of children with CML before and after the advent of IM-based treatment. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 52 patients treated for CML at the Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea from January 1995 to October 2010. Patients were divided and analyzed according to the preImatinib group (pre-IMG) and imatinib group (IMG). RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for the overall cohort (pre-IMG, n=27; IMG, n=25) was 9 years, with a median follow-up duration of survivors of 84 months. Except for 5 patients in the IMG, all were diagnosed in chronic phase (CP). The overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed in CP was 45.7% and 89.7% for pre-IMG and IMG, respectively (P=0.025). The OS of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients in the 2 groups was similar, but the OS of patients diagnosed in CP who did not receive HSCT was superior in IMG (91.7% vs. 16.7%, P=0.014). Of the 12 patients in IMG who remained on IM without HSCT, 2 showed disease progression, compared to 11 of 12 in pre-IMG. No difference was observed in the progression free survival (PFS) of matched donor HSCT recipients and IM-based treatment recipients. CONCLUSION: Similar PFS of patients treated with IM and those who received matched donor HSCT underscore the potential of IM as effective first-line treatment in childhood CML.",,"['Oh, Hyun Jin', 'Cho, Mun Sung', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Oh HJ', 'Cho MS', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130827,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic transplantation', 'Children', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Imatinib mesylate']",2013/09/11 06:00,2013/09/11 06:01,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2013.56.8.343 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2013 Aug;56(8):343-50. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2013.56.8.343.

ABCB1 SNPs and haplotypes have been suggested to influence the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcome of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, used for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, no consensus has yet been reached with respect to the significance of variant ABCB1 in CML treatment. Functional studies of variant ABCB1 transport of imatinib as well as other TKIs might aid the interpretation of results from in vivo association studies, but are currently lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of ABCB1 variant haplotypes for transport and efficacy of TKIs (imatinib, its major metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib [CGP74588], dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) in CML cells. Variant haplotypes - including the 61A>G, 1199G>A, 1236C>T, 1795G>A, 2677G>T/A, and 3435T>C SNPs - were constructed in ABCB1 complementary DNA and transduced to K562 cells using retroviral gene transfer. The ability of variant cells to express ABCB1 protein and protect against TKI cytotoxicity was investigated. It was found that dasatinib and the imatinib metabolite CGP74588 are effectively transported by ABCB1, while imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are comparatively weaker ABCB1 substrates. None of the investigated haplotypes altered the protective effect of ABCB1 expression against TKI cytotoxicity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Resected, stage III colon carcinomas from patients (N = 2,686) randomly assigned to FOLFOX +/- cetuximab (North Central Cancer Treatment Group N0147 trial) were analyzed for mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression and mutations in BRAF(V600E) (exon 15) and KRAS (codons 12 and 13). Association of biomarkers with disease-free survival (DFS) was determined using Cox models. A validation cohort (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 88903 trial) was used. RESULTS: dMMR was detected in 314 (12%) of 2,580 tumors, of which 49.3% and 10.6% had BRAF(V600E) or KRAS mutations, respectively. MMR status was not prognostic overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.07; P = .14), yet significant interactions were found between MMR and primary tumor site (P(interaction) = .009) and lymph node category (N1 v N2; P(interaction) = .014). Favorable DFS was observed for dMMR versus proficient MMR proximal tumors (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94; P = .018) but not dMMR distal tumors (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.95; P = .056), adjusting for mutations and covariates. Any survival benefit of dMMR was lost in N2 tumors. Mutations in BRAF(V600E) (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.70; P = .009) or KRAS (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.70; P < .001) were independently associated with worse DFS. The observed MMR by tumor site interaction was validated in an independent cohort of stage III colon cancers (P(interaction) = .037). CONCLUSION: The prognostic impact of MMR depended on tumor site, and this interaction was validated in an independent cohort.

In the context of a ligand-induced dimer, identical wild-type EGFR TKDs are thought to assume the donor or acceptor roles in a random manner. Here, we present biochemical reconstitution data demonstrating that activated EGFR mutants found in lung cancer preferentially assume the acceptor role when coexpressed with WT EGFR. Mutated EGFRs show enhanced association with WT EGFR, leading to hyperphosphorylation of the WT counterpart. Mutated EGFRs also hyperphosphorylate the related erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene (ErbB) family member, ErbB-2, in a similar manner. This directional ""superacceptor activity"" is particularly pronounced in the drug-resistant L834R/T766M mutant. A 4-A crystal structure of this mutant in the active conformation reveals an asymmetric dimer interface that is essentially the same as that in WT EGFR. Asymmetric dimer formation induces an allosteric conformational change in the acceptor subunit. Thus, superacceptor activity likely arises simply from a lower energetic cost associated with this conformational change in the mutant EGFR compared with WT, rather than from any structural alteration that impairs the donor role of the mutant.

RESULTS: Viral genomic sequences were not detected in any sample by neither standard nor nested PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the methodologic strictness and high statistical power of the study, these results suggest that HTLV1 and MMTV-LV are not involved in the genesis of childhood ALL in Mexican children.

Novel inbred strains-genetically diverse from classic strains-are valuable both as a new background for GEM mice and to increase the genetic variation found in laboratory mice. Newly arising spontaneous genetic alterations in commonly used strains may also lead to new and valuable mouse models of disease. This report evaluates gross and histological lesions in relatively new, classic, and rarely explored mouse inbred strains. Pathological lesions of 1273 mice from 12 inbred strains (129S1/SvW, A.CA-H2(f) /W, AKR/W, BALB/cW, BN/aW, C57BL/6 W, C57BL/10 W, C3H/W, C3H (wad) /W, CBA/W, DBA/2 W, and WOM/W) are reported. BN/aW, WOM/W, and C3H (wad) /W are novel inbred strains produced and maintained in the Department of Genetics and Laboratory Animal Breeding at the Center of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland. Both neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions were examined. The prevalence of lung neoplasms was significantly higher in A.CA-H2(f) /W (33.3%) and BALB/cW (33.8%) mice (P < .01). The prevalence of liver neoplasms was significantly higher in the CBA/W strain (P < .01). Mammary gland neoplasms arose at a greater frequency in C3H/W mice (P < .01). The occurrence of uterine neoplasms was higher in DBA/W and 129S1/SvW mice.

METHODS: Pediatric patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors, myeloid leukemia or high-risk solid tumors were eligible. Subjects agreeing to start ETF before cycle 2 chemotherapy were considered proactive participants (PPs). Those who declined could enroll as chart collection receiving nutritional standard of care. Nutritional status was assessed using standard anthropometric measurements. Episodes of infection and toxicity related to ETF were documented from diagnosis to end of therapy. A descriptive comparison between PPs and controls was conducted. RESULTS: One hundred four eligible patients were identified; 69 enrolled (20 PPs and 49 controls). At diagnosis, 17% of all subjects were underweight and 26% overweight. Barriers to enrollment included physician, subject and/or family refusal, and inability to initiate ETF prior to cycle 2 of chemotherapy. Toxicity of ETF was minimal, but higher percentage of subjects in the proactive group had episodes of infection than controls. Thirty-nine percent of controls eventually started ETF and were twice as likely to receive parenteral nutrition. PPs experienced less weight loss at ETF initiation than controls receiving ETF and were the only group to demonstrate improved nutritional status at end of study. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive ETF is feasible in children with cancer and results in improved nutritional status at end of therapy. Episodes of infection in this study are concerning; therefore, a larger randomized trial is required to further delineate infectious risks and toxicities that may be mitigated by improved nutritional status.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Sacks, Nancy', 'Hwang, Wei-Ting', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Tan, Kay-See', 'Sandler, Eric S', 'Rogers, Paul C', 'Womer, Richard B', 'Pietsch, John B', 'Rheingold, Susan R']","['Sacks N', 'Hwang WT', 'Lange BJ', 'Tan KS', 'Sandler ES', 'Rogers PC', 'Womer RB', 'Pietsch JB', 'Rheingold SR']","[""Department of Clinical Nutrition, Division of Oncology, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130909,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Enteral Nutrition', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Intubation, Gastrointestinal', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*rehabilitation', '*Nutritional Status', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['enteral tube feeding', 'nutrition', 'nutrition support', 'nutritional status', 'pediatric oncology', 'proactive']",2013/09/11 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24759 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Feb;61(2):281-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24759.

We have characterized the binding of UMI-77 to Mcl-1 by using complementary biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods and determined its antitumor activity against a panel of pancreatic cancer cells and an in vivo xenograft model. UMI-77 binds to the BH3-binding groove of Mcl-1 with Ki of 490 nmol/L, showing selectivity over other members of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. UMI-77 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, accompanied by cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that UMI-77 blocks the heterodimerization of Mcl-1/Bax and Mcl-1/Bak in cells, thus antagonizing the Mcl-1 function. The Bax/Bak-dependent induction of apoptosis was further confirmed using murine embryonic fibroblasts that are Bax- and Bak-deficient. In an in vivo BxPC-3 xenograft model, UMI-77 effectively inhibited tumor growth.

The present study was undertaken to determine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), including c-jun NH2 -terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 MAPK, and anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in regulation of WA-induced apoptosis using human breast cancer cells. Exposure of MCF-7 (estrogen responsive) and SUM159 (triple negative) human breast cancer cells to WA resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but these effects were relatively more pronounced in the former cell line than in SUM159. Overexpression of manganese-superoxide dismutase conferred partial protection against WA-mediated hyperphosphorylation of ERK, but not JNK or p38 MAPK. Cell death resulting from WA treatment in MCF-7 cells was significantly augmented by pharmacological inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK. Interestingly, the WA-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was partially but significantly blocked in the presence of a JNK-specific inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK or JNK had no effect on WA-induced apoptosis in SUM159 cells. The WA-treated cells exhibited induction of long and short forms of Mcl-1. RNA interference of Mcl-1 alone triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, the WA-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells was modestly but significantly augmented by knockdown of the Mcl-1 protein. These observations indicate that: MAPK have cell line-specific role in cell death by WA, and Mcl-1 induction confers modest protection against WA-induced apoptosis.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hahm, Eun-Ryeong', 'Lee, Joomin', 'Singh, Shivendra V']","['Hahm ER', 'Lee J', 'Singh SV']","['Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130909,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Withanolides)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'L6DO3QW4K5 (withaferin A)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Superoxide Dismutase/biosynthesis', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Withanolides/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['MAPK', 'Mcl-1', 'apoptosis', 'breast cancer', 'withaferin A']",2013/09/11 06:00,2015/01/08 06:00,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.22050 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2014 Nov;53(11):907-16. doi: 10.1002/mc.22050.

METHODS: Using self-report survey measures, survivors of leukemia, bladder, or colorectal cancer who were 2-5 years post-diagnosis and received follow-up care in the past year (N = 623) provided information about the presence of bothersome symptoms, symptom-related information needs, adequacy of symptom-related care, and their physical and mental HRQOL. Multivariable statistical analyses were conducted to identify correlates of symptom bother, inadequate care, and symptom information needs and to examine the association between symptom bother and HRQOL. RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the 606 respondents experienced symptom bother in the past year (46 % of leukemia, 24 % of bladder, and 26 % of colorectal cancer survivors). Younger survivors, those of Hispanic ethnicity, with low income, those with recurrent cancer, and chemotherapy recipients were more likely to report symptom bother (all p < 0.05). Symptom bother was associated with lower physical and mental HRQOL (p < 0.001). While 92 % of survivors with symptoms discussed them with their follow-up care physician, 52 % of these reported receiving inadequate symptom care. Survivors reporting inadequate symptom care were 2.5 times as likely to identify symptom information needs compared to those who received adequate care (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: One in four cancer survivors report symptoms 2-5 years post-diagnosis, and only half of these survivors receive adequate care to address those symptoms.

PEL is difficult to treat and there is no standard treatment strategy. Hippuristanol is extracted from Okinawan coral Isis hippuris, and inhibits translational initiation by blocking eukaryotic initiation factor 4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, binding to mRNA. Recently, there has been much interest in targeting translation initiation as an anticancer therapy. Here, we show that treatment of PEL cell lines with hippuristanol resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and induced caspases activation and apoptosis. Hippuristanol also reduced the expression of cyclin D2, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and prosurvival XIAP and Mcl-1 proteins. Activation of activator protein-1, signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 3 and Akt pathways plays a critical role in the survival and growth of PEL cells. Hippuristanol suppressed the activities of these three pathways by inhibiting the expression of JunB, JunD, c-Fos, signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 3 and Akt proteins. In a xenograft mouse model that showed ascites and diffused organ invasion of PEL cells, treatment with hippuristanol significantly inhibited the growth and invasion of PEL cells compared with untreated mice.

In response, we would like to review the accumulated evidence from several independent laboratories that adult tissues, including BM, harbor a population of very rare stem cells that may cross germ layers in their differentiation potential. Thus, the BM stem cell compartment hierarchy needs to be revisited. These dormant, early-development cells that our group described as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) most likely overlap with similar populations of stem cells that have been identified in adult tissues by other investigators as the result of various experimental strategies and have been given various names. As reported, murine VSELs have some pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Moreover, they display several epiblast/germline markers that suggest their embryonic origin and developmental deposition in adult BM. Moreover, at the molecular level, changes in expression of parentally imprinted genes (for example, Igf2-H19) and resistance to insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) regulates their quiescent state in adult tissues. In several emergency situations related to organ damage, VSELs can be activated and mobilized into peripheral blood, and in appropriate animal models they contribute to tissue organ/regeneration. Interestingly, their number correlates with lifespan in mice, and they may also be involved in some malignancies.

In isolation, it is traditionally associated with favorable prognosis compared with other subtypes of MDS. However, owing to the inherent heterogeneity of the disease, prognosis for patients with del(5q) MDS is highly variable depending on the presence of factors such as additional chromosomal abnormalities, >5 % blasts in the bone marrow (BM), or transfusion dependence. Over recent years, the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in patients with del(5q) MDS. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease have suggested that lenalidomide targets aberrant signaling pathways caused by haplosufficiency of specific genes in a commonly deleted region on chromosome 5 (e.g., SPARC, RPS14, Cdc25C, and PP2A). As a result, the agent specifically targets del(5q) clones while also promoting erythropoiesis and repopulation of the bone marrow in normal cells. This review discusses recent developments in the understanding of the mechanism of action of lenalidomide, and how this underlies favorable outcomes in patients with del(5q) MDS.

PostHSCT immunologic reconstitution is a critical component for successful outcome. Pretransplant conditioning impairs thymic function, leading to delayed T cell regeneration. Thymus-independent T cell expansion is associated with defective generation of naive T cells and memory T cell skewing, resulting in decreased diversity in the T cell repertoire, thus attenuating the immune responses and increasing the risk of opportunistic infections and leukemia relapse. Wingless (Wnt) signaling has been identified as an important regulator of T cell development and function. Activated Wnt signaling inhibited differentiation of mature T cells in transgenic mouse models. The effect of Wnt activation on T cell regeneration following HSCT was not investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that the GSK-3beta inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin 3'-oxime (BIO) activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, elevates the proportion of naive T cells, and delays T cell differentiation during homeostatic T cell expansion in lymphodepleted mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells. In vitro BIO-treatment promoted naive T cell expansion following mitogenic stimulation and improved proliferative responses of T cells to allogeneic stimuli. Treatment with BIO acts to expand the IL7Ralpha(+) subset of naive T cells, suggesting the potential mechanism driving T cell expansion during IL-7-dependent T cell proliferation. BIO downregulated expression of genes activated during effector cell differentiation and preserved naive T cell gene expression. We propose that administration of GSK-3beta inhibitor increases the potency of T cells in recipients of HSCT by expansion of naive T cell subsets with a diverse T cell receptor repertoire.","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

For these reasons multiplex methods have been developed to simultaneously measure numerous cytokines in individual small volume specimens. The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of flow cytometric analysis of cytokines in peripheral blood and bone marrow plasma with Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) kits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 59 children. Tests were performed in peripheral blood and bone marrow plasma. Human Inflammatory Cytokine Kit (IL-8, -1beta, -6, -10, TNF, -12p70) and Human Th(1)/Th(2)/Th(1)(7) Cytokine Kit (IL-2, -4, -6, -10, TNF, INF-gamma, -17A) (BD Bioscience) were used. Samples were analyzed on a Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). RESULTS: In patients diagnosed for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (n=10) and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=12) Human Inflammatory Cytokine Kit was used. In almost all samples individual cytokines were detected in a wide range of concentrations (0.47 - 653.74 pg/ml). In samples from patients suffering from allergy (n=12) and in healthy children (n=25) Human Th(1)/Th(2)/Th(1)(7) Cytokine Kit was used. Detection of individual cytokines was much lower: concentration range 0.09-30.17 pg/ml. DISCUSSION: Based on our analysis the CBA test is suitable for analysis of several cytokines in small volumes of samples. A simple flow cytometer can be used for this test. The CBA test is more suitable for samples with expected increased levels of cytokines. When the levels of cytokines are low, the sensitivity of the CBA test can be too low.",,"['Stelmaszczyk-Emmel, Anna', 'Kopatys, Agata', 'Gorska, Elzbieta', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka, Eliza', 'Demkow, Urszula']","['Stelmaszczyk-Emmel A', 'Kopatys A', 'Gorska E', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka E', 'Demkow U']",['Department of Laboratory Diagnostics and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age Medical University of Warsaw.'],['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20130826,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-8)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*analysis/blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/analysis/blood', 'Interleukin-8/analysis/blood', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2013/09/11 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1064009 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1064009 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2013 Aug 26;67:879-86. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1064009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 3339 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 1434 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received myeloablative conditioning and related or unrelated stem cells from 1990 to 2005. Most clinical factors predictive of LFS in 1-year survivors were no longer significant after 2 or more years. For acute myeloid leukemia, only disease status (beyond first complete remission) remained a significant adverse risk factor for LFS 2 or more years after transplantation. For lymphoblastic leukemia, only extensive chronic GVHD remained a significant adverse predictor of LFS in the second and subsequent years. For patients surviving for 1 year without disease relapse or extensive chronic GVHD, the risk of developing extensive chronic GVHD in the next year was 4% if no risk factors were present and higher if noncyclosporine-based GVHD prophylaxis, an HLA-mismatched donor, or peripheral blood stem cells were used. Estimates for subsequent LFS and extensive chronic GVHD can be derived for individual patients or populations using an online calculator (http://www.cibmtr.org/LeukemiaCalculators).

However, the underlying mechanism of SOCS1 inactivation remains elusive. In this study, we explored the role of histone methylation in SOCS1 expression in AML cells. By ChIP assay, we demonstrated that G9a and SUV39H1, two enzymes catalyzing H3K9 methylation, were physically associated with the SOCS1 promoter, and treatment with chaetocin, a histone methyltransferase inhibitor, suppressed H3K9 methylation on the SOCS1 promoter and enhanced SOCS1 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of G9a and SUV39H1 by siRNA could also induce SOCS1 expression. On the other hand, SOCS1 knockdown by shRNA eliminated chaetocin-induced cell apoptosis. To investigate further whether any transcription factor was involved in H3K9 methylation-related SOCS1 repression, we scanned the sequences of the SOCS1 gene promoter and found two binding sites for Gfi-1, a transcription repressor. By DNA pull-down and ChIP assays, we showed that Gfi-1 directly bound the SOCS1 promoter, and ectopic Gfi-1 expression suppressed STAT5-induced SOCS1 promoter activation. In contrast, Gfi-1 knockdown by shRNA enhanced SOCS1 expression and inhibited STAT5 expression. Moreover, the knockdown of G9a completely rescued the repressive effect of Gfi-1 on STAT5A-induced SOCS1 promoter activation. Collectively, our study indicates that the expression of Gfi-1 contributes to SOCS1 silencing in AML cells through epigenetic modification, and suppression of histone methyltransferase can provide new insight in AML therapy.",,"['Lee, Ming-Cheng', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Hsiao, Michael', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Lee MC', 'Kuo YY', 'Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Hsiao M', 'Tien HF']","['1.National Taiwan University Hospital, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Rd., Taipei, Taiwan. hftien@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130909,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '28097-03-2 (chaetocin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",['NOTNLM'],"['G9a', 'H3K9 methylation', 'SUV39H1']",2013/09/11 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0912475 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0912475 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2014 Jan;95(1):105-15. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0912475.

We are only beginning to understand the complex cross talk between neoplastic B cells and the tissue microenvironment, for example in secondary lymphoid organs, but some key cellular and molecular players have emerged. Mesenchymal stromal cells, nurselike cells (NLC) and lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM), in concert with T cells, natural killer cells and extracellular matrix components participate in the dialog with the neoplastic B cells. B cell receptor signaling, activation via TNF family members (i.e. BAFF, APRIL), and tissue homing chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules are important in the interaction between malignant B cells and their microenvironment. Disrupting this cross talk is an attractive novel strategy for treating patients with B cell malignancies. Here, we summarize the cellular and molecular interactions between B cell lymphoma/leukemia cells and their microenvironment, and the therapeutic targets that are emerging, focusing on small molecule inhibitors that are targeting B cell receptor-associated kinases SYK, BTK, and PI3Ks, as well as on immunomodulatory agents and T cell mediated therapies.

METHODS: Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells were inoculated with SDAU09C2 strain of ALV-B and ALV-CEF was inactivated for preparation of oil-adjuvant vaccine. Eggs were collected from un-vaccinated and 9 vaccinated great parent female chickens for incubation. 1-day-old chicks were bled for testing their maternal antibodies to ALV-A/B and then inoculated with ALV-B. Viremia and cloaca p27 detection dynamics were tested and compared between chick groups with or without maternal antibody to ALV. RESULTS: In 3 weeks after 3 vaccination with the inactivated vaccine, all 9 vaccinated breeders developed high antibody titers against ALV-A/B with ELISA read values of 1.69-1.89 (the positive base line was 0.4) and kept at the high titers for at least another 4 weeks. Maternal antibody was detected in 70% (12/17) of chicks from breeders with high antibody titers to ALV-A/B. Only 4 of 12 chickens with maternal antibodies developed temporary viremia and no viremia was detected in the left 8 maternal antibody positive chickens during the whole 14 week after inoculation of ALV-B at 1 day of age. But the persistent viremia was detected in 2-8 weeks in all 9 maternal antibody negative chickens and the viremia persisted in the whole tested period of 14 weeks after inoculation of ALV-B. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivated ALV-B vaccine could induce high titer antibody reaction to ALV-B, it could provide maternal antibodies to 1-day-old chickens and protect chickens from early infection of ALV-B.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Its organic and inorganic components are extracted from the red algae Lithothamnion calcareum, whose mineral extract has shown growth-inhibitory effect both on in vitro and in vivo models. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of CF on leukemic cells. In fact, according to its capacity to modulate O2 availability and to improve mitochondrial respiratory metabolism, we wondered if CF could affect cancer cell metabolism making cells susceptible to apoptosis. METHODS: Three leukemic cell lines, Jurkat, U937, and K562, were treated with CF 5 mul/ml up to 72 hours. Cell viability, apoptosis (i.e. caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation), hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) concentration, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) expression, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and lactate release in the culture medium were detected and compared with untreated cells. RESULTS: CF significantly inhibited leukemic cell viability by promoting cell apoptosis, as revealed by caspase-3 activation and DNA laddering. In particular, CF treated cells showed lower HIF-1alpha levels and lower GLUT-1 expression as compared to untreated cells. At the same time, CF was able to reduce LDH activity and, consequently, the amount of lactate released in the extracellular environment. CONCLUSIONS: We supplied evidence for an antiproliferative effect of CF on leukemia cell lines by inducing cell death through an apoptotic mechanism and by altering cancer cell metabolism through HIF-1alpha and GLUT-1 regulation. Thanks to its antioxidative and proapoptotic properties, CF might be a good candidate for cancer prevention.",,"['Catalani, Simona', 'Carbonaro, Valentina', 'Palma, Francesco', 'Arshakyan, Marselina', 'Galati, Rossella', 'Nuvoli, Barbara', 'Battistelli, Serafina', 'Canestrari, Franco', 'Benedetti, Serena']","['Catalani S', 'Carbonaro V', 'Palma F', 'Arshakyan M', 'Galati R', 'Nuvoli B', 'Battistelli S', 'Canestrari F', 'Benedetti S']","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Section of Clinical Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, University of Urbino ""Carlo Bo"", Via Ubaldini 7, 61029 Urbino, PU, Italy. serena.benedetti@uniurb.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130909,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Minerals)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sulfates)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Enzymes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Minerals/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rhodophyta/chemistry', 'Sulfates/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,,2013/09/11 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2013/09/11 06:00'],"['2013/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-32-63 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-32-63 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Sep 9;32:63. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-32-63.,PMC3847119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selecting a target expressed in multiple-tumor types and that is required for tumor growth would widen disease indications and prevent immune escape caused by the emergence of antigen-loss variants. The adhesive receptor CD44 is broadly expressed in hematologic and epithelial tumors, where it contributes to the cancer stem/initiating phenotype. In this study, silencing of its isoform variant 6 (CD44v6) prevented engraftment of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM) cells in immunocompromised mice. Accordingly, T cells targeted to CD44v6 by means of a chimeric antigen receptor containing a CD28 signaling domain mediated potent antitumor effects against primary AML and MM while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells and CD44v6-expressing keratinocytes. Importantly, in vitro activation with CD3/CD28 beads and interleukin (IL)-7/IL-15 was required for antitumor efficacy in vivo. Finally, coexpressing a suicide gene enabled fast and efficient pharmacologic ablation of CD44v6-targeted T cells and complete rescue from hyperacute xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease modeling early and generalized toxicity.

In HTLV-1-infected T cell lines and ATL cells, okadaic acid (OkA), a potent PP2A inhibitor, induced decrease in cell viability and G(1) cell cycle arrest by decreasing the expression levels of cyclin D2, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6, phosphorylation of pRb, and upregulation of p21, p27 and GADD45alpha. OkA-induced apoptosis was also due to the suppression of expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and XIAP, and the activation of caspases-3, -8 and -9, and caspase-3 downstream mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 and H2AX. OkA inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B DNA binding and activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Other new PP2A-specific inhibitors, cytostatin and rubratoxin A, also induced decrease in cell viability through caspase-dependent mechanism. MAP kinase inhibitors confirmed the role of p38 MAP kinase in PP2A inhibitors-induced apoptosis. OkA resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species, and exogenous antioxidant prevented activation of the indicated caspases. Finally, PP2A knockdown inhibited cell growth. The results showed that PP2A inhibition caused reactive oxygen species generation and affected distinct signaling pathways, resulting in the activation of H2AX and subsequent apoptotic cell death.

The physician chooses a treatment at each stage based on the patient's baseline covariates and history of previous treatments and outcomes. Such sequentially adaptive medical decision-making processes are known as dynamic treatment regimes, treatment policies, or multi-stage adaptive treatment strategies. Conventional analyses in terms of frontline treatments that ignore subsequent treatments may be misleading, because they actually are an evaluation of more than front-line treatment effects on outcome. We are motivated by data from a randomized trial of four combination chemotherapies given as frontline treatments to patients with acute leukemia. Most patients in the trial also received a second-line treatment, chosen adaptively and subjectively rather than by randomization, either because the initial treatment was ineffective or the patient's cancer later recurred. We evaluate effects on overall survival time of the 16 two-stage strategies that actually were used. Our methods include a likelihood-based regression approach in which the transition times of all possible multi-stage outcome paths are modeled, and estimating equations with inverse probability of treatment weighting to correct for bias.

Fibrosis severity correlated with T cell LGL cell numbers in the BM, but not in the periphery, suggesting deregulation is limited to the BM microenvironment. To identify fibrosis-initiating populations, primary mesenchymal stromal cultures (MSCs) from patients were characterized and found to display proliferation kinetics and overabundant collagen deposition, but displayed normal telomere lengths and osteoblastogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation potentials. To determine the effect of fibrosis on healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), bioartificial matrixes from rat tail or purified human collagen were found to suppress HPC differentiation and proliferation. The ability of patient MSCs to support healthy HSC proliferation was significantly impaired, but could be rescued with collagenase pretreatment. Clustering analysis confirmed the undifferentiated state of patient MSCs, and pathway analysis revealed an inverse relationship between cell division and profibrotic ontologies associated with reduced basic fibroblast growth factor production, which was confirmed by ELISA.

Dose-response analyses from toxicity studies from government reports were evaluated and the most sensitive cancer and noncancer endpoints were selected. The risks were evaluated by taking the ratio (margin of exposure, MOE) from the most sensitive toxicity endpoint and appropriate exposure estimates for BD in MSS and ETS. BD is a good choice for lowering given that MSS and ETS were at levels for cancer (leukemia) and noncancer (ovarian atrophy) risks, and the risks can be significantly lowered when lowering the BD concentrations in smoke. Several risk reduction strategies were analyzed including a maximum level of 125% of the median BD value per milligram nicotine obtained from international brands as recommended by the WHO TobReg, tobacco substitute sheets, dual and triple carbon filters, and polymer-derived carbon. The use of tobacco substitute sheet with a polymer-derived carbon filter resulted in the most significant change in risk for cancer and noncancer effects.

Among the most novel and promising of these approaches are chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies that combine advances in genetic engineering and adoptive immunotherapy.",,"['Park, Jae H', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Park JH', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Genetic Therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology']",,,2013/09/10 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-8051-8_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2013;792:241-57. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-8051-8_11.,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL has a highly varied clinical course. The substantial clinical variability in the clinical course of CLL has motivated intense efforts at identifying molecular markers that can be used for CLL prognostication. While many such markers have been proposed, few have stood the test of time; this is due to various reasons outlined in detail in this chapter.Of the reasons that have affected the usefulness and broad applicability of CLL biomarkers a few stand out as recurrent: lack of independent effects of individual markers on prognosis; the use of arbitrary cutoffs when using continuous variables; technical challenges in validity, reproducibility, and reliability (classical test characteristics); and lack of marker validation in prospectively identified CLL patient cohorts.Nonetheless, a few useful prognostic markers (CLL interphase FISH, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status) have been identified, and others are still in transition to widespread clinical applications (TP53 mutations, SNP array-based elevated genomic complexity).As CLL therapy transitions from genotoxic combination therapies to targeted therapies, it will be of importance to reestablish the usefulness of our current understanding of individual CLL traits in CLL prognosis.

The most common pathologic phenotype at the time of RS transformation is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), while, in a small fraction of cases, the transformed phase shows pathologic features mimicking Hodgkin lymphoma. TP53 disruption and MYC activation cooperate as dual hits in driving DLBCL transformation. Two biomarkers (NOTCH1 mutations and usage of the immunoglobulin VH CDR3 subset 8) may help in identifying CLL patients at risk of DLBCL transformation to be considered for close monitoring and a careful biopsy policy. In the presence of clinical features suspicious of RS, diagnosis of transformation and choice of the site of biopsy may take advantage of (18)FDG PET/CT. The prognosis of RS transformation is generally highly unfavorable. However, the pattern of survival is not homogeneous and may be predicted on clinical and biological grounds. RS that are clonally unrelated to the paired CLL phase are biologically and clinically different from clonally related cases, and should be considered, and probably managed, as a de novo DLBCL arising in the context of CLL.

The critical role of BcR IG-mediated signaling in CLL development and evolution is underscored by the following: the disease-biased IG gene repertoire; the subdivision of CLL based on the somatic hypermutation load of the BcR IG into two broad categories with vastly different prognosis and eventual outcome; the existence of subsets of cases with distinct, quasi-identical (stereotyped) BcR IGs; and the clinical efficacy of novel therapeutics inhibiting BcR signaling.

The knockdown of the SLC1A5 high-affinity transporter for glutamine induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor formation in a mouse AML xenotransplantation model. l-asparaginase (l-ase) is an anticancer agent also harboring glutaminase activity. We show that l-ases from both Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi profoundly inhibit mTORC1 and protein synthesis and that this inhibition correlates with their glutaminase activity levels and produces a strong apoptotic response in primary AML cells. We further show that l-ases upregulate glutamine synthase (GS) expression in leukemic cells and that a GS knockdown enhances l-ase-induced apoptosis in some AML cells.

In addition to B-cell receptor (BCR)-triggered signals, other microenvironmental factors might well be involved. In proliferation centers, leukemic B cells are in close contact with CD4(+)CD40L(+) T cells. Therefore, we here dissected the signals provided by autologous activated T cells (Tact) to CLL cells. Although the gene expression profile induced by Tact was highly similar to that induced by sole CD40 signaling, an obvious difference was that Tact induced proliferation of CLL cells. We determined that stimulation with only CD40L+IL-21 was sufficient to induce robust proliferation in CLL cells. We then defined an interleukin (IL)-21-induced gene signature in CLL, containing components of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and apoptosis pathways, and this signature could be detected in lymph node (LN) samples from patients. Finally, we could detect IL-21 RNA and protein in LN, and IL-21 production ex vivo by LN CD4(+)CXCR5(+) follicular helper T cells.

Several solid tumors produce high levels of HA, which promotes survival and multidrug resistance (MDR). HA oligomers (oHAs) can block HA effects. However, little is known about the role of HA in hematological malignancies. The aim of this work was to determine whether HA or its oligomers can modulate the proliferation of leukemia cells as well as their effect on MDR. Receptors and signaling pathways involved were also analyzed. For this purpose, the human leukemic cell lines K562 and Kv562, which are sensitive and resistant to Vincristine (VCR), respectively, were used. We demonstrated that HA induced cell proliferation in both cell lines. On K562 cells, this effect was mediated by cluster differentiation 44 (CD44) and activation of both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, whereas on Kv562 cells, the effect was mediated by receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) and PI3K/Akt activation. The inhibition of HA synthesis by 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) decreased cell line proliferation and sensitized Kv562 to the effect of VCR through P-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibition, in both cases with senescence induction. Moreover, oHAs inhibited K562 proliferation mediated by CD44 as well as Akt and ERK down-regulation. Furthermore, oHAs sensitized Kv562 cells to VCR by Pgp inhibition inducing senescence. We postulate that the synthesis of HA would promote leukemia progression mediated by the triggering of the above-mentioned proliferative signals. These findings highlight the potential use of oHAs and 4MU as coadjuvant for drug-resistant leukemia.",,"['Lompardia, Silvina Laura', 'Papademetrio, Daniela Laura', 'Mascaro, Marilina', 'Alvarez, Elida Maria del Carmen', 'Hajos, Silvia Elvira']","['Lompardia SL', 'Papademetrio DL', 'Mascaro M', 'Alvarez EM', 'Hajos SE']","['Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, Buenos Aires 1113, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130906,England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Hymecromone/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'RHAMM', 'drug resistance', 'hyaluronan', 'leukemia', 'senescence']",2013/09/10 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2013/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cwt074 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwt074 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2013 Dec;23(12):1463-76. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwt074.

We estimated the cancer burden among Arab Americans (ArA) by immigrant status in the metropolitan Detroit area, home to one of the highest concentrations of ArA in USA. METHODS: A validated name algorithm was used to identify ArA cancer cases diagnosed 1990-2009 in the Detroit SEER database. Recorded birthplace was supplemented with imputation of nativity using birthdate and social security number. Age-adjusted, gender-specific proportional incidence ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated comparing all ArA, foreign-born ArA, and US-born ArA, to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). RESULTS: Foreign-born ArA males had higher proportions of multiple myeloma, leukemia, kidney, liver, stomach, and bladder cancer than NHW, while bladder cancer and leukemia were higher among US-born ArA males. For ArA women, gall bladder and thyroid cancers were proportionally higher among both foreign- and US-born compared with NHW. Stomach cancer was proportionally higher only among foreign-born women. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer proportional incidence patterns among ArA show some similarity to other migrant groups, with higher proportional incidences of stomach and liver cancers among foreign-born than US-born. Other patterns, such as tobacco-related cancers among ArA men and gall bladder and thyroid cancers among ArA women, will require more investigation of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.",,"['Khan, Fatima', 'Ruterbusch, Julie J', 'Gomez, Scarlett L', 'Schwartz, Kendra']","['Khan F', 'Ruterbusch JJ', 'Gomez SL', 'Schwartz K']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, School of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130907,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arabs/ethnology', 'Cities', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'SEER Program/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Urban Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology']",,,2013/09/10 06:00,2014/06/03 06:00,['2013/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-013-0271-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2013 Nov;24(11):1955-61. doi: 10.1007/s10552-013-0271-4.

Here, we present a case of DCL following cord blood transplantation (CBT) and review the clinical features of previously reported DCL. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing clinical characteristics of DCL from the standpoint of the transplant source, with umbilical cord blood and BM. AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were recognized more frequently in DCL after CBT, whereas the incidence of AML and ALL was similar after BMT. The median duration between the occurrence of DCL following CBT and BMT was 14.5 and 36 months, respectively. DCL occurred in a significantly shorter period after CBT than after BMT. Abnormal karyotypes involving chromosome 7 were observed in 52.4% of CBT recipients and 17.3% of BMT recipients; this was a statistically significant difference. Particularly, the frequency of monosomy 7 was significantly higher in DCL after CBT than after BMT.

However, these proteins usually contain more fingers than are needed for sequence-specific DNA binding, which suggests that different fingers regulate different genes and functions. Here we found that mice lacking finger 1 or finger 4 of Ikaros exhibited distinct subsets of the hematological defects of Ikaros-null mice. Most notably, the two fingers controlled different stages of lymphopoiesis, and finger 4 was selectively required for tumor suppression. The distinct defects support the hypothesis that only a small number of genes that are targets of Ikaros are critical for each of its biological functions.

We report here immunological analysis of clinical trials of primary and secondary vaccination with K562/GM-CSF immunotherapy in adult chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients (CML-CP) with suboptimal responses to imatinib mesylate. Using serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries of K562 with autologous vaccinated patient serum, we have identified 12 novel chronic myeloid leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs). We show that clinical responses following K562/GM-CSF vaccination are associated with induction of high-titer antibody responses to multiple LAAs. We observe markedly discordant patterns of baseline and induced antibody responses in these identically vaccinated patients. No single antigen was recognized in all responses to vaccination. We demonstrate that an additional 'booster' vaccination series can be given safely to those with inadequate responses to initial vaccination, and is associated with more frequent induction of IgG responses to antigens overexpressed in K562 vaccine compared with primary CML-CP. Finally, those with induced immune responses to the same LAAs often shared HLA subtypes and patients with clinical responses following vaccination recognized a partially shared but non-identical spectrum of antigens; both findings have potentially significant implications for cancer vaccine immunotherapy.",,"['Qin, L', 'Smith, B D', 'Tsai, H-L', 'Yaghi, N K', 'Neela, P H', 'Moake, M', 'Fu, J', 'Kasamon, Y L', 'Prince, G T', 'Goswami, M', 'Rosner, G L', 'Levitsky, H I', 'Hourigan, C S']","['Qin L', 'Smith BD', 'Tsai HL', 'Yaghi NK', 'Neela PH', 'Moake M', 'Fu J', 'Kasamon YL', 'Prince GT', 'Goswami M', 'Rosner GL', 'Levitsky HI', 'Hourigan CS']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130906,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,,,2013/09/10 06:00,2013/09/10 06:01,['2013/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201344 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.44 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Sep 6;3:e145. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.44.,PMC3789208,,"['R01 CA142620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HL006163-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007247/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000000261898067'],,,,,,

Now we report that decreased PKR activity inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of PKR expression or activity reduces protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, a B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) phosphatase, resulting in enhanced Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Thus, inhibition of PKR activity leads to hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2, stabilization of Bcl-2/Bax interaction and decreased Bax insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Treatment with the PP2A activator, FTY720, restores Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and apoptosis in cells with reduced PKR expression following stress. Significantly, xenografts of REH leukemic cells with reduced PKR display significantly increased tumor volume, increased resistance to doxorubicin treatment and shorter survival. Importantly, FTY720 treatment restores sensitivity to chemotherapy and prolongs overall survival of these mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that PP2A activation is a downstream target of PKR and the PKR/PP2A signaling axis is required for rapid and potent stress-induced apoptosis. Importantly, loss of PKR promotes leukemia progression and may serve as a biomarker for predicting chemosensitivity.",,"['Cheng, X', 'Bennett, R L', 'Liu, X', 'Byrne, M', 'Stratford May, W']","['Cheng X', 'Bennett RL', 'Liu X', 'Byrne M', 'Stratford May W']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology and the University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130906,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,,,,,2013/09/10 06:00,2013/09/10 06:01,['2013/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['bcj201342 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2013.42 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2013 Sep 6;3:e144. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2013.42.,PMC3789206,,['R01 HL054083/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the mechanisms mediated by sorcin still remain quite elusive. This study aim to explore whether sorcin silencing could restore chemosensitivity in MDR cancer cells and seek to identify the functional mechanisms mediated by sorcin. METHODS: To investigate the mechanisms of sorcin-silencing-induced chemosensitivity, transient expression of sorcin-siRNAs was performed in doxorubicin-induced MDR cell lines, K562/A02 and MCF-7/A02. Sensitivity to five chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated by analysis of cell survival and cell apoptosis. RESULTS: In this report, we show that down-regulation of sorcin did not alter expression or function of P-gp, but actually induced cell apoptosis and chemosensitivity in K562/A02 and MCF-7/A02. We also observe that silencing of sorcin-enhanced chemotherapeutic agent effects partly through regulating apoptosis-related protein, including Bcl-2, Bax, c-jun and c-fos. CONCLUSION: This offers the rationale for the development of therapeutic strategies down-regulating sorcin expression for the treatment of cancer, especially for the reversal of MDR.",,"['Hu, Yunhui', 'Cheng, Xin', 'Li, Shuangjing', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Yang, Ming', 'Xiong, Dongsheng']","['Hu Y', 'Cheng X', 'Li S', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang J', 'Cheng T', 'Yang M', 'Xiong D']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Pharmacy, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130908,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SRI protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage']",,,2013/09/10 06:00,2014/04/29 06:00,['2013/09/10 06:00'],"['2013/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-013-2254-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Oct;72(4):789-98. doi: 10.1007/s00280-013-2254-2.

Few molecules exhibited potent growth inhibitory action against the treated cancer cell lines at lower micro molar concentration. An in vitro assay investigation of these active compounds using recombinant human SIRT1 enzyme showed that one of the compounds (IT-14) inhibited the deacetylation activity of the enzyme. The in vivo study of IT-14 exemplified its promising action by reducing the prostate weight to the body weight ratio in prostate hyperplasia animal models. A remarkable decrease in the disruption of histoarchitecture of the prostate tissues isolated from IT-14 treated animal compared to that of the positive control was observed.

After reviewing previous studies, we realized that the most significant associations were restricted to intron 3, but the mechanism(s) by which those SNPs affect ALL risk remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the association between genetic variants of the intron 3 region of ARID5B and the incidence of B-ALL in a Spanish population. We also aimed to find a functional explanation for the association, searching for copy number variations (CNVs), and changes in ARID5B expression associated with the genotypes of the SNPs. METHODS: We analyzed 10 SNPs in intron 3 of ARID5B in a Spanish population of 219 B-ALL patients and 397 unrelated controls with the Taqman Open Array platform. CNVs were analyzed in 23 patients and 17 controls using the Cytogenetics Whole-genome 2.7 M platform. Expression of ARID5B transcript 1 was quantified by qPCR and related to SNPs genotype in seven ALL cell lines. RESULTS: Association between intron 3 and B-ALL risk was confirmed for all of the SNPs evaluated in our Spanish population. We could not explain this association by the presence of CNVs. We neither detected changes in the expression of ARID5B isoform associated with the genotype of the SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: The intron 3 of ARID5B gene was found to be strongly associated with B-ALL risk in the Spanish population examined.

This paper describes the application of cellular fractionation with LC-MS for profiling histones in the cytosol and upon chromatin. First, we show that linker histones enriched by cellular fractionation gives less nuclear contamination and higher histone content than when prepared by nuclei isolation. Second, we profiled the soluble linker histones throughout the cell cycle revealing phosphorylation increases as cells reach mitosis. Finally, we monitored histone H1.2-H1.5 translocation to the cytosol in response to the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol in primary CLL cells treated ex vivo. Data shows that all H1 variants translocate in response to drug treatment with no specific order to their cytosolic appearance. The results illustrate the utility of cellular fractionation in conjunction with LC-MS for the analysis of histone H1 throughout the cell. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This paper demonstrates the first time application of cellular fractionation to characterize cytosolic histone H1 by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using the Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, cellular fractionation was shown to give less nuclear contamination and higher histone content than preparations by nuclei isolation. Further application of the cellular fractionation approach was shown by using primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to monitor the movement of histone H1 across cellular compartments in response to the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol. Collectively, these data establish a mass spectrometric method for exploration into the function of cytosolic histone H1.",['(c) 2013. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In total, 41 spots were differentially expressed and 13 proteins were identified with further MS analysis. Two essential proteins, Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (c-ABL) and Heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (Apg-2), were confirmed by Western blot and showed consistent changes with proteomic results. Moreover, functional analysis demonstrated that inhibition of Apg-2 not only decreased cell proliferation, but also induced cell apoptosis in BCR/ABL positive cells (BaF3-BCR/ABL, BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I)). We also proved that Apg-2 inhibition aggravated H2O2 induced damage in BCR/ABL positive cells, and enhanced the sensitivity of BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I) to STI571.

Furthermore, venous thromboembolism and acute lymphoblastic leukemia microarray data were applied. The results of three GSAs showed that the competence of these methods depends on the distribution of gene expression in a dataset.

Despite the great efficacy of the Bcr-Abl-specific inhibitor imatinib, resistance to this drug is recognized as a major problem in CML treatment. We found that in LAMA84 cells, characterized by imatinib-resistance caused by BCR-ABL1 gene amplification, the pro-survival protein kinase CK2 is up-regulated as compared to the sensitive cells. CK2 exhibits a higher protein-level and a parallel enhancement of catalytic activity. Consistently, CK2-catalysed phosphorylation of Akt-Ser129 is increased. CK2 co-localizes with Bcr-Abl in the cytoplasmic fraction as judged by subcellular fractionation and fluorescence immunolocalization. CK2 and Bcr-Abl are members of the same multi-protein complex(es) in imatinib-resistant cells as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-sedimentation in glycerol gradients. Cell treatment with CX-4945, a CK2 inhibitor currently in clinical trials, counteracts CK2/Bcr-Abl interaction and causes cell death by apoptosis. Interestingly, combination of CX-4945 with imatinib displays a synergistic effect in reducing cell viability. Consistently, knockdown of CK2alpha expression by siRNA restores the sensitivity of resistant LAMA84 cells to low imatinib concentrations. Remarkably, the CK2/Bcr-Abl interaction and the sensitization towards imatinib obtained by CK2-inhibition in LAMA84 is observable also in other imatinib-resistant CML cell lines. These results demonstrate that CK2 contributes to strengthen the imatinib-resistance phenotype of CML cells conferring survival advantage against imatinib. We suggest that CK2 inhibition might be a promising tool for combined strategies in CML therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

It has also shown to be active in other hematologic and no hematologic diseases. Growing evidence of its use entails a challenge when situating the drug in a cost-effective way to treat these diseases. On this article we review the available evidence on the use of lenalidomide in the second line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary amyloidosis and primary myelofibrosis, and in the first line treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and also the evidence of other immunomodulators. Different clinical practice guidelines and scientific evidence portals consider lenalidomide a valid alternative in the first-line treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, specially those with the deletion of 5q, and in second line for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, the available evidence of lenalidomide in the treatment of patients with primary amyloidosis and primary myelofibrosis is limited, ant thus is not considered as the first choice treatment.

SFFV integrates several kilobases upstream of the PU.1 transcription initiation start site leading to the constitutive activation of the gene which in turn results in a block of erythroid differentiation. In this study we have mapped and sequenced the exact location of the retroviral integration site. We have shown that SFFV integrates downstream of a previously described upstream regulatory element (URE), precisely 2,976 bp downstream of the URE-distal element. We have also found that SFFV persists integrated within the same location in resistant cell lines that have lost their differentiation capacity and in which case PU.1 remains silent. We have examined the methylation status of PU.1 and found that in resistant cells the nearby CpG islands remained methylated in contrast to a non-methylated status of the parental cell lines. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine caused resistant cells to differentiate yet only when combined with HMBA. Altogether these results strongly suggest that methylation plays a crucial role with regard to PU.1 silencing. However, although demethylation is required, it is not sufficient to overcome the differentiation impasse. We have also showed that activation blockage of the Epo/Epo-R pathway remains despite of the absence of PU.1.",,"['Fernandez-Nestosa, Maria Jose', 'Monturus, Estefania', 'Sanchez, Zunilda', 'Torres, Francisco S', 'Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Fraga, Mario F', 'Hernandez, Pablo', 'Schvartzman, Jorge B', 'Krimer, Dora B']","['Fernandez-Nestosa MJ', 'Monturus E', 'Sanchez Z', 'Torres FS', 'Fernandez AF', 'Fraga MF', 'Hernandez P', 'Schvartzman JB', 'Krimer DB']","['Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia/CNB-CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130821,Switzerland,Springerplus,SpringerPlus,101597967,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Erythroleukemia cells', 'PU.1', 'SFFV']",2013/09/07 06:00,2013/09/07 06:01,['2013/09/07 06:00'],"['2013/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2193-1801-2-392 [doi]', '469 [pii]']",epublish,Springerplus. 2013 Aug 21;2:392. doi: 10.1186/2193-1801-2-392. eCollection 2013.,PMC3758488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the anti-allergic activity of A. gramineus was investigated. The 70% ethanol extract of the rhizomes of A. gramineus was found to inhibit the allergic response against 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-catalyzed leukotriene (LT) production from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells and beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells with IC50's of 48.9 and >200 mug/ml, respectively. Among the 9 major constituents isolated, beta-asarone, (2R,3R,4S,5S)-2,4-dimethyl-1,3-bis (2',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran (AF) and 2,3-dihydro-4,5,7-trimethoxy-1-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)indene (AI) strongly inhibited 5-LOX-catalyzed LT production in A23187-treated RBL-1 cells, AI being the most potent (IC50=6.7 muM). Against beta-hexosaminidase release by antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, only AI exhibited strong inhibition (IC50=7.3 muM) while beta-asarone and AF showed 26.0% and 39.9% inhibition at 50 muM, respectively. In addition, the ethanol extract of A. gramineus showed significant inhibitory action against the hapten-induced delayed hypersensitivity reaction in mice by oral administration at 200 mg/kg. Therefore, it is suggested that A. gramineus possesses anti-allergic activity and the constituents including beta-asarone and AI certainly contribute to the anti-allergic activity of the rhizomes of A. gramineus.",,"['Lim, Hyun', 'Lee, Seung Young', 'Lee, Kang Ro', 'Kim, Yeong Shik', 'Kim, Hyun Pyo']","['Lim H', 'Lee SY', 'Lee KR', 'Kim YS', 'Kim HP']","['College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chunchon 200-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Biomol Ther (Seoul),Biomolecules & therapeutics,101472832,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['2', '3-Dihydro-4', '4', '5', '5-Lipoxygenase', '5-trimethoxyphenyl)indene', '7-trimethoxy-1-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2', 'Acorus gramineus', 'Anti-allergy', 'beta-Asarone', 'beta-Hexosaminidase']",2013/09/07 06:00,2013/09/07 06:01,['2013/09/07 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4062/biomolther.2012.20.5.477 [doi]', 'ooomb4-20-477 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2012 Sep;20(5):477-81. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2012.20.5.477.,PMC3762279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by metformin in Bp- and T-ALL cell models and primary cells, and show that metformin effectively induces apoptosis in ALL cells. Metformin activated AMPK, down-regulated the unfolded protein response (UPR) demonstrated by significant decrease in the main UPR regulator GRP78, and led to UPR-mediated cell death via up-regulation of the ER stress/UPR cell death mediators IRE1alpha and CHOP. Using shRNA, we demonstrate that metformin-induced apoptosis is AMPK-dependent since AMPK knock-down rescued ALL cells, which correlated with down-regulation of IRE1alpha and CHOP and restoration of the UPR/GRP78 function. Additionally rapamycin, a known inhibitor of mTOR-dependent protein synthesis, rescued cells from metformin-induced apoptosis and down-regulated CHOP expression. Finally, metformin induced PIM-2 kinase activity and co-treatment of ALL cells with a PIM-1/2 kinase inhibitor plus metformin synergistically increased cell death, suggesting a buffering role for PIM-2 in metformin's cytotoxicity. Similar synergism was seen with agents targeting Akt in combination with metformin, supporting our original postulate that AMPK and Akt exert opposite regulatory roles on UPR activity in ALL. Taken together, our data indicate that metformin induces ALL cell death by triggering ER and proteotoxic stress and simultaneously down-regulating the physiologic UPR response responsible for effectively buffering proteotoxic stress. Our findings provide evidence for a role of metformin in ALL therapy and support strategies targeting synthetic lethal interactions with Akt and PIM kinases as suitable for future consideration for clinical translation in ALL.",,"['Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Leclerc, Guy J', 'Kuznetsov, Jeffim N', 'DeSalvo, Joanna', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Leclerc GM', 'Leclerc GJ', 'Kuznetsov JN', 'DeSalvo J', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Pediatrics Hematology and Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Unfolded Protein Response']",,,2013/09/07 06:00,2014/04/17 06:00,['2013/09/07 06:00'],"['2013/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0074420 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-16598 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 23;8(8):e74420. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0074420. eCollection 2013.,PMC3751848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a desperate need to develop therapy to combat this acquired drug resistance. DCC-2036 has been synthesized as a third-generation TKI to combat especially the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant in chronic myeloid leukemia. This study evaluated the effect of DCC-2036 on FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-positive cells, including the wild type (WT) and the T674I mutant. The in vitro effects of DCC-2036 on the PDGFRalpha signal pathways, proliferation, cell cycling and apoptosis of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-positive cells were investigated, and a nude mouse xenograft model was employed to assess the in vivo antitumor activity. We found that DCC-2036 decreased the phosphorylated levels of PDGFRalpha and its downstream targets without apparent effects on total protein levels. DCC-2036 inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis with MEK-dependent up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-positive cells. DCC-2036 also exhibited in vivo antineoplastic activity against cells with T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha.

Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and special AT-rich region binding protein 1 (SATB1) are two global chromatin organizing proteins that have been shown to regulate HLA class I expression in Jurkat cells. We analyzed HLA class I, number of PML nuclear bodies (NBs) and SATB1 expression in tumor cells of 54 EBV+ cHL cases and used 27 EBV- cHL cases as controls. There was a significant difference in presence of HLA class I staining between EBV+ and EBV- cases (p<0.0001). We observed normal HLA class I expression in 35% of the EBV+ and in 19% of the EBV- cases. A stronger than normal HLA class I expression was observed in approximately 40% of EBV+ cHL and not in EBV- cHL cases. 36 EBV+ cHL cases contained less than 10 PML-NBs per tumor cell, whereas 16 cases contained more than 10 PML-NBs. The number of PML-NBs was positively correlated to the level of HLA class I expression (p<0.01). The percentage of SATB1 positive cells varied between 0% to 100% in tumor cells and was inversely correlated with the level of HLA class I expression, but only between normal and strong expression (p<0.05).

However, mutation of this region of Core typically disrupts nucleocapsid formation in the cytoplasm, making it difficult to ascertain if the Core PPAY motif constitutes a functional L-domain that mediates HBV release in the context of replicating virus. Since many viral L-domains are functionally interchangeable between different virus families, and such swapping experiments have been used as a tool to identify other viral sequences with L-domain activity, we generated chimeric constructs between murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag and HBV Core to determine if the potential HBV L-domain motif is sufficient to stimulate virus release. We found that the HBV Core PPAY motif, but not the PNAP motif, demonstrates L-domain activity in the context of MLV replication to direct virus release and infectious virion production. Additionally, we found that overexpression of the cellular Nedd4 or WWP1 ubiquitin ligases stimulates release of a partially defective PPAY domain mutant, providing further evidence supporting a role for the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase in promoting HBV release.

A. chica is known to be a good producer of phenolics. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated its antioxidant activity. The phenolic composition of A. chica leaves was studied by liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection (LC-DAD) and liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), and isoscutellarein, 6-hydroxyluteolin, hispidulin, scutellarein, luteolin, and apigenin were identified. The extract from leaves of A. chica was tested for antioxidant activity using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, beta-carotene bleaching test, and total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP) method. The crude extract quenched DPPH free radicals in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 of the extract was 13.51 microg/mL. The beta-carotene bleaching test showed that the addition of the A. chica extract in different concentrations (200 and 500 microg/mL) prevented the bleaching of beta-carotene at different degrees (51.2% +/-3.38% and 94% +/-4.61%, respectively).

Using microarray based gene expression profiling we have recently demonstrated that the gene for Pgrn, granulin (GRN), is significantly higher expressed in aggressive CD38(+)ZAP-70(+) as compared to indolent CD38(-)ZAP-70(-) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases. Here, we measured Pgrn plasma concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the Essen CLL cohort of 131 patients and examined Pgrn for association with established prognostic markers and clinical outcome. We found that high Pgrn plasma levels were strongly associated with adverse risk factors including unmutated IGHV status, expression of CD38 and ZAP-70, poor risk cytogenetics (11q-, 17p-) as detected by flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high Binet stage. Pgrn as well as the aforementioned risk factors were prognostic for time to first treatment and overall survival in this series. Importantly, these results could be confirmed in the independent multicentric CLL1 cohort of untreated Binet stage A patients (n = 163). Here, multivariate analysis of time to first treatment revealed that high risk Pgrn (HR = 2.06, 95%-CI = 1.13-3.76, p = 0.018), unmutated IGHV status (HR = 5.63, 95%-CI = 3.05-10.38, p<0.001), high risk as defined by the study protocol (HR = 2.06, 95%-CI = 1.09-3.89, p = 0.026) but not poor risk cytogenetics were independent prognostic markers.

MLL-AF4 ALL is typically characterized by the presence of chromosomal translocation (t(4;1l)(q21;q23)), leading to expression of MLL-AF4 fusion protein. Although MLL-AF4 fusion protein triggers a molecular pathogenesis and hematological presentations that are unique to leukemias, the precise role of this oncogene in leukemogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRs) might modulate the expression of MLL-AF4 ALL fusion protein, thereby suggesting the involvement of miR in progression or suppression of MLL-AF4 ALL. We have previously demonstrated that miR-205 negatively regulates transcription of an MLL-AF4 luciferase reporter. Here, we report that exogenous expression of miR-205 in MLL-AF4 human cell lines (RS4;11 and MV4-11) inversely regulates the expression of MLL-AF4 at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level. Furthermore, miR-205 significantly induced apoptosis in MLL-AF4 cells as evidenced by Annex in V staining using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The proliferative capacity of leukemic cells was suppressed by miR-205. The addition of an miR-205 inhibitor was able to restore the observed effects.

Targeting the CLL membrane and associated signaling patterns is a current focus of therapeutic development. Many tumor membrane targets are simultaneously targeted by humoral immunity, thus forming recognizable immunoglobulin responses. We sought to use this immune response to identify novel membrane-associated targets for CLL. Using a novel strategy, we interrogated CLL membrane-specific autologous immunoglobulin G reactivity. Our analysis unveiled lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1), a lymphocyte-specific target that is highly expressed in CLL. LCP1 plays a critical role in B-cell biology by crosslinking F-actin filaments, thereby solidifying cytoskeletal structures and providing a scaffold for critical signaling pathways. Small interfering RNA knockdown of LCP1 blocked migration toward CXCL12 in transwell assays and to bone marrow in an in vivo xenotransplant model, confirming a role for LCP1 in leukemia migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1. Our data demonstrate a novel strategy to identify cancer membrane target antigens using humoral anti-tumor immunity.

METHOD: PRAME and TRAIL expression was detected in bone marrow samples from 80 newly diagnosed acute leukaemia (AL) patients and 40 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients using TaqMan-based real-time quantitative PCR methods, and a linear correlation analysis was performed on their levels of expression. A total of 15 normal bone marrow samples from individuals with non-malignant haematological diseases served as normal controls. RESULTS: PRAME expression was higher in both AL and CML patients compared to controls (both p < 0.001). CML patients in both blast crisis (BC) and the accelerated phase (AP) had significantly higher PRAME levels than CML patients in the chronic phase (CP) (p = 0.006 and 0.0461, respectively). TRAIL expression was higher in both the acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) group and the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) group than in the controls (p = 0.039 and 0.047, respectively). In contrast, CML patients had lower TRAIL levels than controls (p = 0.043), and TRAIL expression in CML patients in the advanced phases (BC and AP) was significantly lower than in CML-CP patients (p = 0.006). In CML patients, there was a significant inverse correlation (Spearman's R = -0.6669, p < 0.0001) between PRAME and TRAIL gene expression, while a greater significant inverse correlation was found in patients in the advanced phases (BC and AP) (R = -0.6764). In addition, no correlation was observed in AML and ALL patients. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous detection of PRAME and TRAIL gene expression may be helpful to monitor condition changes in leukaemia patients and evaluate therapeutic effects in clinical practice, particularly in CML patients.","['(c) 2013 S.

In an attempt to survive, injured photoreceptors generate survival signals to induce intercellular protective mechanisms that eventually may rescue photoreceptors from entering an apoptotic death pathway. One such endogenous survival pathway is controlled by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which is produced by a subset of Muller glia cells in response to photoreceptor injury. In the absence of LIF, survival components are not activated and photoreceptor degeneration is accelerated. Although LIF is a crucial factor for photoreceptor survival, the detailed mechanism of its induction in the retina has not been elucidated. Here, we show that administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was sufficient to fully upregulate Lif expression in Muller cells in vitro and the retina in vivo. Increased Lif expression depended on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) since inhibition of its activity abolished Lif expression in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity reduced the Lif expression also in the model of light-induced retinal degeneration and resulted in increased cell death in the light-exposed retina. Thus, expression of Lif in the injured retina and activation of the endogenous survival pathway involve signaling through p38 MAPK.",,"['Agca, C', 'Gubler, A', 'Traber, G', 'Beck, C', 'Imsand, C', 'Ail, D', 'Caprara, C', 'Grimm, C']","['Agca C', 'Gubler A', 'Traber G', 'Beck C', 'Imsand C', 'Ail D', 'Caprara C', 'Grimm C']","['Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich 8091, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130905,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Cytoprotection/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Ependymoglial Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology/radiation effects', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Light', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/drug effects/*enzymology/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Rats', 'Retinal Degeneration/enzymology/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,,2013/09/07 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/09/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2013323 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2013.323 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2013 Sep 5;4:e785. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2013.323.,PMC3789181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was demonstrated that SBL causes mitochondrial perturbation and the apoptotic signal is amplified by caspases and cell death is executed in a caspase-dependent manner. The efficacy of this combinational usage was shown for the first time, to distinguish the apoptotic pathway in detail.

The level of glycolytic metabolism was significantly increased in the polyploidy cells, which were sensitive to glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), suggesting that polyploidy cells might be eliminated by metabolism deprivation. Indeed, inhibition of mTOR pathway by mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and PP242) or 2DG promoted not only apoptosis but also autophagy in the polyploidy cells induced by Aurora inhibitors. Mechanically, PP242 or2DGdecreased the level of glucose uptake and lactate production in polyploidy cells as well as the expression of p62/SQSTM1. Moreover, knockdown of p62/SQSTM1 sensitized cells to the Aurora inhibitor whereas overexpression of p62/SQSTM1 reduced drug efficacy.

This study examines specific treatment exposures associated with cardiovascular risk factors and insulin resistance. METHODS: CCS of ages 9 to 18 years at study entry and in remission 5 years or more from diagnosis (n = 319) and 208 sibling controls were recruited into this cross-sectional study that included physiologic assessment of insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) and assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. Regression and recursive tree modeling were used to ascertain treatment combinations associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: Mean current age of CCS was 14.5 years and 54% were male (siblings 13.6 years, 54% male). Diagnoses included leukemia (35%), brain tumors (36%), solid tumors (33%), or lymphoma (6%). Among CCS, analysis of individual chemotherapy agents failed to find associations with cardiovascular risk factors or insulin resistance. Compared with siblings, insulin resistance was significantly higher in CCS who received platinum plus cranial radiotherapy (CRT, 92% brain tumors) and in those who received steroids but no platinum (majority leukemia). Insulin resistance did not differ between CCS who received surgery alone versus siblings. Within survivor comparisons failed to elucidate treatment combinations that increased insulin resistance compared with those who received surgery only. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to platinum, CRT, or steroids is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors and should be taken into consideration in the development of screening recommendations for cardiovascular risk.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of midazolam on growth of K562 human leukemia cells and HT29 colon cancer cells. The in vivo effect of midazolam was investigated in BALB/c-nu mice bearing K562 and HT29 cells human tumor xenografts. The results show that midazolam decreased the viability of K562 and HT29 cells by inducing apoptosis and S phase cell-cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Midazolam activated caspase-9, capspase-3 and PARP indicating induction of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Midazolam lowered mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Midazolam showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity through inhibition of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) enzyme activity in K562 cells. Midazolam caused inhibition of pERK1/2 signaling which led to inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and XIAP and phosphorylation activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid. Midazolam inhibited growth of HT29 tumors in xenograft mice. Collectively our results demonstrate that midazolam caused growth inhibition of cancer cells via activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and inhibited HT29 tumor growth in xenograft mice. The mechanism underlying these effects of midazolam might be suppression of ROS production leading to modulation of apoptosis and growth regulatory proteins.

Despite the recent advances in chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and supportive care, the prognosis for patients with ATL is one of the poorest among hematological malignancies; overall survival (OS) at 3 years is only 24 % in the more aggressive subtypes of ATLL. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus infecting approximately 10-20 million people worldwide, particularly in southern and southeastern Japan, the Caribbean, highlands of South America, Melanesia, and Equatorial Africa. Despite this high frequency of human infection, only 2-5 % of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATLL. Three major routes of viral transmission have been established: (1) mother-to-child transmission through breast-feeding; (2) sexual transmission, predominantly from men to women; and (3) cellular blood components.

Oncogenic viruses include various classes of DNA and RNA viruses and induce cancer by a variety of mechanisms. A unifying theme is that cancer develops in a minority of infected individuals and only after chronic infection of many years duration. The viruses associated with the greatest number of cancer cases are the human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which cause cervical cancer and several other epithelial malignancies, and the hepatitis viruses HBV and HCV, which are responsible for the majority of hepatocellular cancer. Other oncoviruses include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Identification of the infectious cause has led to several interventions that may reduce the risk of developing these tumors. These include preventive vaccines against HBV and HPV, HPV-based testing for cervical cancer screening, anti-virals for the treatment of chronic HBV and HCV infection, and screening the blood supply for the presence of HBV and HCV.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ATRA on the production and secretion of MMP-2 and -9 in HDPCs. The productions and messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of MMP-2 and -9 were accessed by gelatin zymography and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. ATRA was found to decrease MMP-2 level in a dose-dependent manner. Significant reduction in MMP-2 mRNA expression was also observed in HDPCs treated with 25 micromolL(-1) ATRA. However, HDPCs treated with ATRA had no effect on the pattern of MMP-9 produced or secreted in either cell extracts or conditioned medium fractions.

Methotrexate is an anticancer agent that is widely used in a variety of human cancers including primary central nervous system lymphoma. The compound was quantified by liquid-chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization (positive ion-mode) low-energy collision dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative detection was by multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions of the [M+H]+ ion of MTX to its common product ion at m/z 308.4 and of aminopterin at m/z 441.2-->m/z 294.0. The method demonstrated linearity over at least three orders of magnitude and had a detection limit of 1ng/ml for methotrexate. A run time of less than 8.0min for each sample made it possible to analyze a large number of human saliva samples per day. Application of this procedure was demonstrated to a saliva excretion study of methotrexate on the samples obtained after an intravenously administration of 1mg/kg/dose of methotrexate to six patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aim has been first to bring to the patient a maximal response and to identify at different time-points what could be considered an optimal response (which is to render the progression free survival as important as possible). To achieve this, new molecular tools were needed, the most important being the real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), to measure the number of remaining transcripts after several period of treatment. The second important tool was the sequencing of the BCR-ABL kinase domain to identify potential mutations giving rise to resistance to imatinib first and next to second generation TKIs. This technique, much more sensitive than cytogenetics, has allowed the definition of important levels of transcripts (the major molecular response i.e. a three log reduction and the complete molecular response i.e. a 4.5 log reduction) the first ensuring a long term PFS on treatment, the second allowing the birth of studies looking at whether it would be possible to discontinue the treatment in this group of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We have identified the transcription factor early growth response gene-2 (EGR2) as a novel molecular switch regulating known immunomodulatory molecules in human MSCs.

Early successes in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia set the stage for a series of studies in young adults utilizing a paediatric-type treatment strategy. These studies have determined that AYAs benefit from paediatric-type chemotherapy regimens. Despite the increased incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the AYA age group, optimal strategies for these patients have not been systematically pursued.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a proteomics comparison of miRNA effects on extracellular matrix secretion by cardiac fibroblasts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pre-/anti-miR of miR-29b and miR-30c, and their conditioned medium was analyzed by mass spectrometry. miR-29b targeted a cadre of proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, matrix metalloproteinases, and leukemia inhibitory factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and pentraxin 3, 3 predicted targets of miR-29b. miR-29b also attenuated the cardiac fibroblast response to transforming growth factor-beta. In contrast, miR-30c had little effect on extracellular matrix production but opposite effects regarding leukemia inhibitory factor and insulin-like growth factor 1. Both miRNAs indirectly affected cardiac myocytes. On transfection with pre-miR-29b, the conditioned medium of cardiac fibroblasts lost its ability to support adhesion of rat ventricular myocytes and led to a significant reduction of cardiac myocyte proteins (alpha-actinin, cardiac myosin-binding protein C, and cardiac troponin I). Similarly, cardiomyocytes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells atrophied under pre-miR-29 conditioned medium, whereas pre-miR-30c conditioned medium had a prohypertrophic effect. Levels of miR-29a, miR-29c, and miR-30c, but not miR-29b, were significantly reduced in a mouse model of pathological but not physiological hypertrophy. Treatment with antagomiRs to miR-29b induced excess fibrosis after aortic constriction without overt deterioration in cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomic analysis revealed novel molecular targets of miRNAs that are linked to a fibrogenic cardiac phenotype.

METHODS: Pediatric patients with AML who received GO, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy on the AML02 multicenter trial, were analyzed to determine the effects of GO on MRD and outcome. RESULTS: Among 17 patients who received GO alone because of persistent leukemia, 14 had a reduction in their MRD level and 13 became MRD negative. Of the 29 who received chemotherapy in combination with GO after responding poorly to chemotherapy, 28 demonstrated reduced MRD and 13 became MRD negative. Treatment with GO effectively reduced MRD before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and was not found to be associated with increased treatment-related mortality after transplantation.

This approach has several potential advantages over conventional methods to generate genetically engineered mouse models. First, continuous constitutive overexpression of an oncogene can be lethal to the host impeding further study. Second, constitutive overexpression fails to model adult onset of disease. Third, constitutive deletion does not permit, whereas conditional overexpression of an oncogene enables the study of the consequences of restoring expression of an oncogene back to endogenous levels. Fourth, the conditional activation of oncogenes enables examination of specific and/or developmental state-specific consequences. Hence, by allowing precise control of when and where a gene is expressed, the tetracycline regulatory system provides an ideal approach for the study of putative oncogenes in both the initiation and maintenance of tumorigenesis.

All sUCBT patients received a total nucleated cell dose >2.5 x 10(7)/kg. Conditioning regimen for sUCBT was total body irradiation (TBI)12 Gy- or busulfan (BU)-based +/- fludarabine (Flu) (n=68, group 1), thiotepa+BU+Flu (TBF) (n=88, group 2), and for dUCBT it was TBI12 Gy+cyclophosphamide +/- Flu (n=83, group 3). dUCBT recipients were younger, received higher cell dose and less frequently antithymocyte globulin. In multivariate analysis, we found similar neutrophil recovery among the three groups; however, acute graft-versus-host disease II-IV was higher in dUCBT compared with others. Non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence were not statistically different among the three groups. Leukemia-free survival was 30% for sUCBT using TBI- or BU-based MAC compared with 48% for sUCBT TBF and 48% for dUCBT (P=0.02 and P=0.03, respectively), and it was not statistically different between sUCBT with TBF and dUCBT. In conclusion, use of sUCBT with adequate cell dose (>2.5 x 10(7)/kg) and a specific conditioning regimen in the MAC setting results in similar outcomes as dUCBT.

The analysis revealed that the F8 and F16 antibodies strongly stained 70% of AML and 75% of ALL bone marrow specimens, whereas chloroma biopsies were stained with all three antibodies. Therapy experiments performed in immunocompromised mice bearing human NB4 leukemia with the immunocytokine F8-IL2 [consisting of the F8 antibody fused to human interleukin-2 (IL-2)] mediated a strong inhibition of AML progression. This effect was potentiated by the addition of cytarabine, promoting complete responses in 40% of treated animals. Experiments performed in immunocompetent mice bearing C1498 murine leukemia revealed long-lasting complete tumor eradication in all treated mice. The therapeutic effect of F8-IL2 was mediated by both natural killer cells and CD8(+) T cells, whereas CD4(+) T cells appeared to be dispensable, as determined in immunodepletion experiments. The treatment of an AML patient with disseminated extramedullary AML manifestations with F16-IL2 (consisting of the F16 antibody fused to human IL-2, currently being tested in phase 2 clinical trials in patients with solid tumors) and low-dose cytarabine showed significant reduction of AML lesions and underlines the translational potential of vascular tumor-targeting antibody-cytokine fusions for the treatment of patients with leukemia.",,"['Gutbrodt, Katrin L', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Giovannoni, Leonardo', 'Frey, Katharina', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Neri, Dario']","['Gutbrodt KL', 'Schliemann C', 'Giovannoni L', 'Frey K', 'Pabst T', 'Klapper W', 'Berdel WE', 'Neri D']","['Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (F8 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Biopsy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/09/06 06:00,2014/03/26 06:00,['2013/09/06 06:00'],"['2013/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['5/201/201ra118 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3006221 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2013 Sep 4;5(201):201ra118. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3006221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction by down-regulating PPP2R5C gene expression in the imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cell lines K562, K562R (imatinib resistant without an Abl gene mutation), 32D-Bcr-Abl WT (imatinib-sensitive murine CML cell line with a wild type Abl gene) and 32D-Bcr-Abl T315I (imatinib resistant with a T315I Abl gene mutation) and primary cells from CML patients by RNA interference. PPP2R5C siRNAs numbered 799 and 991 were obtained by chemosynthesis. Non-silencing siRNA scrambled control (SC)-treated, mock-transfected, and untreated cells were used as controls. The PPP2R5C mRNA and protein expression levels in treated CML cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, and in vitro cell proliferation was assayed with the cell counting kit-8 method. The morphology and percentage of apoptosis were revealed by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry (FCM). The results demonstrated that both siRNAs had the best silencing results after nucleofection in all four cell lines and primary cells. A reduction in PPP2R5C mRNA and protein levels was observed in the treated cells. The proliferation rate of the PPP2R5C-siRNA-treated CML cell lines was significantly decreased at 72 h, and apoptosis was significantly increased. Significantly higher proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction were found in K562R cells treated with PPP2R5C-siRNA799 than K562 cells. In conclusion, the suppression of PPP2R5C by RNA interference could inhibit proliferation and effectively induce apoptosis in CML cells that were either imatinib sensitive or resistant. Down-regulating PPP2R5C gene expression might be considered as a new therapeutic target strategy for CML, particularly for imatinib-resistant CML.",,"['Shen, Qi', 'Liu, Sichu', 'Chen, Yu', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Bo', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Zhu, Kanger', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Shen Q', 'Liu S', 'Chen Y', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Wu X', 'Li B', 'Lu Y', 'Zhu K', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130903,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2R5C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",,,2013/09/06 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2013/09/06 06:00'],"['2013/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-6-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-64 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2013 Sep 3;6:64. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-6-64.,PMC3847136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the pathogenesis of RS, we analyzed a series of cases including 59 RS, 28 CLL phase of RS, 315 CLL, and 127 de novo DLBCL. RS demonstrated a genomic complexity intermediate between CLL and DLBCL. Cell-cycle deregulation via inactivation of TP53 and of CDKN2A was a main mechanism in the histologic transformation from CLL phase, being present in approximately one half of the cases, and affected the outcome of the RS patients. A second major subgroup was characterized by the presence of trisomy 12 and comprised one third of the cases. Although RS shared some of the lesions seen in de novo DLBCL, its genomic profile was clearly separate.

Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) induces neuroblastoma cell differentiation in vitro, but its mechanisms still remains unknown. We used three human neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, IGR-N-91, LAN-1) that differ from their MYCN and p53 status to explore the intracellular events activated by As2O3 and involved in neurite outgrowth, a morphological marker of differentiation. As2O3 (2muM) induced neurite outgrowth in all cell lines, which was dependent on ERK activation but independent on MYCN status. This process was induced either by a sustained (3 days) or a transient (2h) incubation with As2O3, indicating that very early events trigger the induction of differentiation. In parallel, As2O3 induced a rapid assembly of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NB) in an ERK-dependent manner. In conclusion, mechanisms leading to neuroblastoma cell differentiation in response to As2O3 appear to involve the ERK pathway activation and PML-NB formation, which are observed in response to other differentiating molecules such as retinoic acid derivates.

Alterations of sno/scaRNA expression may play a role in cancerogenesis. This study elucidates the patterns of sno/scaRNA expression in 211 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (Binet stage A) also in comparison with those of different normal B-cell subsets. METHODS: The patterns of sno/scaRNA expression in highly purified CD19+ B-cells of 211 CLL patients and in 18 normal B-cell samples--6 from peripheral blood, and 12 from tonsils (4 germinal center, 2 marginal zone, 3 switched memory and 3 naive B-cells)--were analyzed on the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Human Gene 1.0 ST array. RESULTS: CLLs display a sno/scaRNAs expression profile similar to normal memory, naive and marginal-zone B-cells, with the exception of a few down-regulated transcripts (SNORA31, -6, -62, and -71C). Our analyses also suggest some heterogeneity in the pattern of sno/scaRNAs expression which is apparently unrelated to the major biological (ZAP-70 and CD38), molecular (IGHV mutation) and cytogenetic markers. Moreover, we found that SNORA70F was significantly down-regulated in poor prognostic subgroups and this phenomenon was associated with the down-regulation of its host gene COBLL1. Finally, we generated an independent model based on SNORA74A and SNORD116-18 expression, which appears to distinguish two different prognostic CLL groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data extend the view of sno/scaRNAs deregulation in cancer and may contribute to discover novel biomarkers associated with the disease and potentially useful to predict the clinical outcome of early stage CLL patients.",,"['Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Ciceri, Gabriella', 'Matis, Serena', 'Massucco, Carlotta', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Reverberi, Daniele', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Bossio, Sabrina', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Ronchetti D', 'Mosca L', 'Cutrona G', 'Tuana G', 'Gentile M', 'Fabris S', 'Agnelli L', 'Ciceri G', 'Matis S', 'Massucco C', 'Colombo M', 'Reverberi D', 'Recchia AG', 'Bossio S', 'Negrini M', 'Tassone P', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","['Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milano, Italy. antonino.neri@unimi.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130903,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Small Nucleolar)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Nucleolar/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2013/09/06 06:00,2014/06/26 06:00,['2013/09/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-6-27 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-6-27 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2013 Sep 3;6:27. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-6-27.,PMC3766210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of AZT and emodin on adriamycin-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562/ADM) cells, determine the expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) mRNA/p-glycoprotein (p-gp) protein, a protein known to induce resistance to anticancer agents, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562/ADM cells were treated with AZT (10-160 muM) or emodin (5-80 muM) for 24, 48 and 72 h and cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. The effect of AZT (16.5, 33 and 66 muM) and emodin (6.1, 17.6 and 33.2 muM) on K562/ADM cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry, and MDR1 mRNA/p-gp protein expression was determined by real time RT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: The growth suppression of emodin was dramatically enhanced by AZT in K562/ADM cells. The IC50 of AZT and emodin was lower than that of emodin alone. All examined combinations of AZT and emodin yielded a synergetic effect (CI < 1). Furthermore, AZT and emodin altered the cell cycle distribution and led to an accumulation of cells in S phase. Meanwhile, the expression of MDR1 mRNA/p-gp protein was markedly decreased. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results show a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect of AZT and emodin in K562/ADM cells, which is achieved through S phase arrest. MDR1 might ultimately be responsible for these phenomena.",,"['Chen, Peng', 'Liu, Yingxia', 'Sun, Yanqing', 'Chen, Che', 'Qi, Yongmei', 'Zhang, Yingmei']","['Chen P', 'Liu Y', 'Sun Y', 'Chen C', 'Qi Y', 'Zhang Y']","['School of Life Science, Lanzhou University , Lanzhou , China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130905,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Emodin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,,2013/09/06 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2013/09/06 06:00'],"['2013/09/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2013.803257 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2013 Dec;51(12):1586-91. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2013.803257.

In a model of ALI induced by bleomycin (bleo), we examined the response of D prostanoid receptor 1 (DP1)-deficient mice (DP1(-/-)) to better understand these processes. DP1 deficiency aggravated the toxicity of bleo as indicated by enhanced body weight loss, mortality, and lung inflammation including bronchoalveolar permeability and neutrophilia. Thymic atrophy was also observed after bleo and was strongly exacerbated in DP1(-/-) mice. This resulted from the enhanced depletion of immature T lymphocytes in the thymus of DP1(-/-) mice, a phenomenon usually related to increased glucocorticoid release in blood. Serum corticosterone was more elevated in DP1(-/-) mice after bleo than in wild-type (wt) mice. Thymocytes of DP1(-/-) mice were not more sensitive to dexamethasone in vitro, and systemic delivery of dexamethasone or peritoneal inflammation after LPS induced a similar thymic atrophy in wt and DP1(-/-) mice, indicating that pulmonary DP1 was critical to the control of thymic atrophy after bleo. DP1(-/-) mice showed increased lung and/or blood mediators involved in neutrophil recruitment and/or glucocorticoid production/thymic atrophy (osteopontin, leukemia inhibitory factor, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine) after bleo. Finally, local pulmonary DP1 activation or inhibition in wt mice abrogated or amplified thymic atrophy after bleo, respectively. Altogether, our data reveal that ALI can perturb the systemic T-cell pool by inducing thymic atrophy and that both pathological processes are controlled by the pulmonary DP1 receptor.

The objectives were to assess whether the patterns of disease observed were consistent with those associated with military service in Vietnam, and similar to the patterns identified in other groups of Vietnam veterans. DESIGN: A historical cohort study. SETTING: Veterans, identified from service records, with Vietnam service between 1964 and 1972. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 3322 survivors of Vietnam service, we followed up 2783 (84%). OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised mortality and incidence ratios (SMRs and SIRs, respectively) were calculated based on the number of deaths and cancer registrations observed, those expected being based on New Zealand national rates. RESULTS: All cause mortality was significantly reduced (SMR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94) and cancer incidence non-significantly increased (SIR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.16). The risk of mortality from cancers of the head and neck (SMR 2.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.93); oral cavity pharynx and larynx (SMR 2.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.81) and the incidence of chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) (SIR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.20) were, however, significantly increased. Other lymphohaematopoietic disorders, specifically multiple myeloma and Hodgkin disease, showed non-significant mortality excesses, reflected by a similar increase in incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Service in the Vietnam war was associated with defoliant herbicide exposure, including 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, picloram and cacodylic acid. Subsequent reviews of mechanistic, animal and epidemiological evidence led to certain conditions being deemed compensable. The pattern of mortality and cancer incidence is not at odds with the list of compensable conditions and consistent with that found in Australian veterans serving in the same area of Vietnam, but also consistent with smoking and the healthy soldier effect. In common with the Australian experience, this is the only veterans group to show a significant excess of CLL.",,"['McBride, David', 'Cox, Brian', 'Broughton, John', 'Tong, Darryl']","['McBride D', 'Cox B', 'Broughton J', 'Tong D']","['Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130903,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'Leukaemia < ONCOLOGY', 'OCCUPATIONAL & INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE']",2013/09/05 06:00,2013/09/05 06:01,['2013/09/05 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/05 06:01 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2013-003379 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003379 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2013 Sep 3;3(9):e003379. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003379.,PMC3773658,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, through genome-wide CBFbeta-MYH11-binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics, we found that CBFbeta-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters, where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the coregulators EP300 and HDAC1. Transcriptional analysis revealed that upon fusion protein knockdown, a small subset of the CBFbeta-MYH11 target genes show increased expression, confirming a role in transcriptional repression. However, the majority of CBFbeta-MYH11 target genes, including genes implicated in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal such as ID1, LMO1 and JAG1, are actively transcribed and repressed upon fusion protein knockdown.

Asparaginase depletes circulating asparagine and glutamine, activating an amino acid stress response (AAR) involving phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) by general control nonderepressible kinase 2 (GCN2). We hypothesized that GCN2 functions to mitigate hepatic stress during asparaginase therapy by activating the AAR. To test this idea, C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Gcn2(+/+)) and those deleted for Gcn2 (Gcn2(-/-)) were injected with asparaginase or saline excipient one time daily for 1 or 6 days. In liver, increased phosphorylation of eIF2 and mRNA expression of AAR target genes activating transcription factor 4, asparagine synthetase, eIF4E-binding protein 1, and CAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein were significantly blunted or blocked in the liver of Gcn2(-/-) mice. Loss of AAR during asparaginase coincided with increases in mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and DNA damage in association with genetic markers of oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase) and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor alpha-alpha). Although asparaginase depleted circulating asparagine in both Gcn2(+/+) and Gcn2(-/-) mice, all other amino acids, including plasma glutamine, were elevated in the plasma of Gcn2(-/-) mice. This study shows that loss of GCN2 promotes oxidative stress and inflammatory-mediated DNA damage during asparaginase therapy, suggesting that patients with reduced or dysfunctional AAR may be at risk of developing hepatic complications during asparaginase treatment.",,"['Wilson, Gabriel J', 'Bunpo, Piyawan', 'Cundiff, Judy K', 'Wek, Ronald C', 'Anthony, Tracy G']","['Wilson GJ', 'Bunpo P', 'Cundiff JK', 'Wek RC', 'Anthony TG']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130903,United States,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,American journal of physiology.

Quizartinib potently and selectively inhibits FLT3 kinase activity in preclinical AML models. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quizartinib was administered orally at escalating doses of 12 to 450 mg/day to 76 patients (median age, 60 years; range, 23 to 86 years; with a median of three prior therapies [range, 0 to 12 therapies]), enrolled irrespective of FLT3-ITD mutation status in a phase I, first-in-human study in relapsed or refractory AML. RESULTS: Responses occurred in 23 (30%) of 76 patients, including 10 (13%) complete remissions (CR) of any type (two CRs, three CRs with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp], five CRs with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) and 13 (17%) with partial remissions (PRs). Of 17 FLT3-ITD-positive patients, nine responded (53%; one CR, one CRp, two CRis, five PRs); of 37 FLT3-ITD-negative patients, five responded (14%; two CRps, three PRs); of 22 with FLT3-ITD-indeterminate/not tested status, nine responded (41%; one CR, three CRis, five PRs). Median duration of response was 13.3 weeks; median survival was 14.0 weeks. The most common drug-related adverse events (> 10% incidence) were nausea (16%), prolonged QT interval (12%), vomiting (11%), and dysgeusia (11%); most were </= grade 2. The maximum-tolerated dose was 200 mg/day, and the dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 QT prolongation. FLT3-ITD phosphorylation was completely inhibited in an in vitro plasma inhibitory assay. CONCLUSION: Quizartinib has clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML, particularly those with FLT3-ITD, and is associated with an acceptable toxicity profile.",,"['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Foran, James M', 'Ghirdaladze, Darejan', 'Zodelava, Mamia', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Gammon, Guy', 'Trone, Denise', 'Armstrong, Robert C', 'James, Joyce', 'Levis, Mark']","['Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian H', 'Foran JM', 'Ghirdaladze D', 'Zodelava M', 'Borthakur G', 'Gammon G', 'Trone D', 'Armstrong RC', 'James J', 'Levis M']","[""Jorge E.

The antibody was conjugated to the maytansinoid, DM1, a potent antimicrotubule agent, via the thioether linker, N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), and the resulting ADC, IMGN529, retained the intrinsic antibody activities and showed enhanced cytotoxic activity from targeted payload delivery. In lymphoma cell lines, IMGN529 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest after internalization and lysosomal processing to lysine-N(epsilon)-SMCC-DM1 as the sole intracellular maytansinoid metabolite. IMGN529 was highly active against subcutaneous B-cell tumor xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice with comparable or better activity than rituximab, a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone, or bendamustine. In human blood cells, CD37 is expressed in B cells at similar levels as CD20, and IMGN529 resulted in potent and specific depletion of normal and CLL B cells.

In the present study, following treatment with a demethylating agent, decitabine, NXF2 expression was detected in the majority of the NXF2negative acute leukemia cell lines, but not in healthy donor samples. This finding was confirmed by western blot analysis. Eight primary acute leukemia bone marrow samples were treated with decitabine in vitro, and results showed that NXF2 expression was significantly upregulated. In another nine acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome patients, it was noted that the expression of NXF2 was upregulated in all patients following the first cycle of decitabine, which suggested that NXF2 was activated by decitabine treatment in vivo. Furthermore, NXF2 expression in acute leukemia cells was demonstrated to be regulated by CpG island hypermethylation.

Previous efforts to determine the causes of HOX11 fragility were not successful. The role of non-B DNA structures is increasingly becoming an important cause of genomic instability. In the present study, bioinformatics analysis revealed two G-quadruplex-forming motifs at the HOX11 breakpoint cluster. Gel shift assays showed formation of both intra- and intermolecular G-quadruplexes, the latter being more predominant. The structure formation was dependent on four stretches of guanines, as revealed by mutagenesis. Circular dichroism analysis identified parallel conformations for both quadruplexes. The non-B DNA structure could block polymerization during replication on a plasmid, resulting in consistent K(+)-dependent pause sites, which were abolished upon mutation of G-motifs, thereby demonstrating the role of the stretches of guanines even on double-stranded DNA. Extrachromosomal assays showed that the G-quadruplex motifs could block transcription, leading to reduced expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) within cells. More importantly, sodium bisulfite modification assay showed the single-stranded character at regions I and II of HOX11 in the genome. Thus, our findings suggest the occurrence of G-quadruplex structures at the HOX11 breakpoint region, which could explain its fragility during the t(10;14) translocation.",,"['Nambiar, Mridula', 'Srivastava, Mrinal', 'Gopalakrishnan, Vidya', 'Sankaran, Sritha K', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Nambiar M', 'Srivastava M', 'Gopalakrishnan V', 'Sankaran SK', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130903,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', '*G-Quadruplexes', 'GC Rich Sequence', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2013/09/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/05 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00540-13 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00540-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Nov;33(21):4266-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00540-13.

Here, we show that adhesion of Jurkat T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to substrates engaging alpha4beta1-integrin or alpha5beta1-integrin promotes chemoresistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Reconstituted expression of alpha4delta, a truncated alpha4-integrin with KXGFFKR as the cytoplasmic motif, in alpha4-deficient cells promoted chemoresistance to doxorubicin in a manner independent of alpha4-mediated adhesion. The adhesion-independent chemoresistance did not require beta1-integrin as the heterodimeric pair, since expression of Tacdelta, a monomeric nonintegrin transmembrane protein fused to the juxtamembrane KXGFFKR, was sufficient to reproduce the phenomenon. The requirement for integrin-mediated adhesion in stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and activation was bypassed for cells expressing alpha4delta and Tacdelta. Cells expressing alpha4delta and Tacdelta exhibited a high influx of extracellular Ca(2+), and inhibition of Ca(2+) channels with verapamil attenuated the adhesion-independent chemoresistance. Tacdelta cells also exhibited greater rates of drug efflux. alpha4delta and Tacdelta interacted with the Ca(2+)-binding protein calreticulin, in a manner dependent on the KXGFFKR motif. Adhesion-mediated engagement of alpha4-integrins promoted an increased calreticulin-alpha4 association and greater influx of extracellular Ca(2+) than in nonadherent cells.

However, its function and activation mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that, compared to its expression in primary human T cells, its expression is upregulated in several leukemia cell lines, including Jurkat T cells. Downregulation of PLEKHG2 in Jurkat T cells by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specifically inhibited Gbetagamma-stimulated Rac and Cdc42, but not RhoA, activation. Consequently, suppressing PLEKHG2 expression blocked actin polymerization and SDF1alpha-stimulated lymphocyte migration. Additional studies indicate that Gbetagamma likely activates PLEKHG2, in part by binding the N terminus of PLEKHG2 to release an autoinhibition imposed by its C terminus, which interacts with a region encompassing the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain. As a result, overexpressing either the N terminus or the C terminus of PLEKHG2 blocked Gbetagamma-stimulated Rac and Cdc42 activation and prevented Jurkat T cells from forming membrane protrusions and migrating. Together, our studies have provided the first evidence for the endogenous function of PLEKHG2, which may serve as a key Gbetagamma-stimulated RhoGEF that regulates lymphocyte chemotaxis via Rac and Cdc42 activation and actin polymerization.",,"['Runne, Caitlin', 'Chen, Songhai']","['Runne C', 'Chen S']",['Departments of Pharmacology.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130903,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (G-protein Beta gamma)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (PLEKHG2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Binding Sites', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', '*Protein Multimerization', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2013/09/05 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/05 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00879-13 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00879-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Nov;33(21):4294-307. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00879-13.

These T cells are usually CD4+CD8- and strongly express CD25, although some variability in this basic pattern may be found. Here we report a case with a very unusual CD1a positive phenotype. Methods: Samples from peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, lymph node and CSF obtained from a 45 year old male patient with a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder were immunophenotyped by multiparametric flow cytometry Analysis of HTLV-I genome integration in tumoral cells was performed by PCR. Results: Neoplastic T cells were cCD3, CD2/CD5/CD30/CD25 and CD1a positive, but CD3/CD7/CD4/CD8/CD34/CD10/TdT negative. Serology and integration of HTLV-I were positive. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge CD1a expression has not been previously described in this entity. Its detection raised the differential diagnosis with acute T lymphoblastic leukemia. The rest of the phenotypic markers, the morphology of the neoplastic cells, and the demonstration of HTLV-I genome integration provided the final diagnosis.

However, it remains unknown whether RACK1 also contributes to the oncogenic growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Here, we report that transient or stable silencing of endogenous RACK1 expression by RACK1 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) led to impaired proliferation of THP1 AML cells without inducing terminal differentiation. Further exploration revealed that RACK1 loss-of-function resulted in reduced GSK3beta activity. GSK3beta shRNA treatment showed similar effects to RACK1 loss-of-function. Our data collectively suggest that RACK1 contributes to THP1 cell proliferation through, at least partially, enhancing GSK3beta activity.

However, most patients progress and become chemoresistant, which remains a major challenge in the management of advanced PCa. In this study, we investigated whether genistein, an isoflavone abundant in soy products, could sensitize mCRPC cells to cabazitaxel treatment in experimental models. METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo effect of genistein in enhancing the response of mCRPC cells to cabazitaxel chemotherapy was evaluated in experimental models. RESULTS: Genistein increases the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, activates apoptotic signals, and enhances the response to cabazitaxel treatment in mCRPC cells. In a PC3-luciferase xenograft model, the combined treatment with genistein and cabazitaxel significantly retarded the growth of mCRPC when compared to vehicle control, cabazitaxel, or genistein. Tissue staining confirmed the in vivo effect of genistein on the induction of Bax and activation of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: This study provided the first preclinical evidence supporting that genistein could be beneficial in improving cabazitaxel chemotherapy in mCRPC.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhang, Shumin', 'Wang, Yanru', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Kim, Sungjin', 'Iqbal, Shareen', 'Chi, Andrew', 'Ritenour, Chad', 'Wang, Yongqiang A', 'Kucuk, Omer', 'Wu, Daqing']","['Zhang S', 'Wang Y', 'Chen Z', 'Kim S', 'Iqbal S', 'Chi A', 'Ritenour C', 'Wang YA', 'Kucuk O', 'Wu D']","['Department of Urology and Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130902,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '51F690397J (cabazitaxel)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Genistein/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Prostate/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Taxoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['cabazitaxel', 'chemoresistance', 'experimental model', 'genistein', 'prostate cancer']",2013/09/04 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/04 06:00'],"['2013/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pros.22705 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2013 Nov;73(15):1681-9. doi: 10.1002/pros.22705.

Each tumor is characterized by a set of chromosomal abnormalities, nonrandom changes preferentially involving specific chromosomes and chromosomal regions. Although tumors accumulate chromosomal abnormalities during their development, the majority of these alterations is specific and characteristic for each individual tumor is not exhibited at the population level. Assumingly, secondary tumors that develop from disseminated cells from the primary tumor inherit not only chromosomal changes specific for the cancerous process but also random chromosomal changes that accumulate during tumor development. Based on this assumption, we adopted an intuitive index for genomic similarities of paired tumors, which ranges between zero (completely different genomic profiles) and one (identical genomic profiles). To test the assumption that two tumors have clonal origins if they share a higher degree of genomic similarity than two randomly paired tumors, we built a permutation-based null-hypothesis procedure. The procedure is demonstrated using two publicly available data sets. The article highlights the complexities of clonality testing and aims to offer an easy to follow blueprint that will allow researchers to test genomic similarities of paired tumors, with the proposed index or any other index that fits their need.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Nemes, Szilard', 'Danielsson, Anna', 'Parris, Toshima Z', 'Jonasson, Junmei Miao', 'Bulow, Erik', 'Karlsson, Per', 'Steineck, Gunnar', 'Helou, Khalil']","['Nemes S', 'Danielsson A', 'Parris TZ', 'Jonasson JM', 'Bulow E', 'Karlsson P', 'Steineck G', 'Helou K']","['Division of Clinical Cancer Epidemiology, Department of Oncology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Regional Cancer Centre (West), Western Sweden Health Care Region, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20130902,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', 'Clone Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,,2013/09/04 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2013/09/04 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22096 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Nov;52(11):1007-16. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22096.

However, CML quiescent HSCs are TKI resistant and represent a BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent disease reservoir. Here we have shown that persistence of leukemic HSCs in BM requires inhibition of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and expression--but not activity--of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene. Examination of HSCs from CML patients and healthy individuals revealed that PP2A activity was suppressed in CML compared with normal HSCs. TKI-resistant CML quiescent HSCs showed increased levels of BCR-ABL1, but very low kinase activity. BCR-ABL1 expression, but not kinase function, was required for recruitment of JAK2, activation of a JAK2/beta-catenin survival/self-renewal pathway, and inhibition of PP2A. PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) markedly reduced survival and self-renewal of CML quiescent HSCs, but not normal quiescent HSCs, through BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent and PP2A-mediated inhibition of JAK2 and beta-catenin. This led to suppression of human leukemic, but not normal, HSC/progenitor survival in BM xenografts and interference with long-term maintenance of BCR-ABL1-positive HSCs in serial transplantation assays. Targeting the JAK2/PP2A/beta-catenin network in quiescent HSCs with PADs (e.g., FTY720) has the potential to treat TKI-refractory CML and relieve lifelong patient dependence on TKIs.",,"['Neviani, Paolo', 'Harb, Jason G', 'Oaks, Joshua J', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Walker, Christopher J', 'Ellis, Justin J', 'Ferenchak, Gregory', 'Dorrance, Adrienne M', 'Paisie, Carolyn A', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Ma, Yihui', 'Mao, Hsiaoyin C', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'May, Philippa C', 'Sun, Chaode', 'Saddoughi, Sahar A', 'Bielawski, Jacek', 'Blum, William', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Solt, Janelle A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Huettner, Claudia S', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Devine, Steven', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Ogretmen, Besim', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Bittman, Robert', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Roy, Denis-Claude', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Goldman, John M', 'Reid, Alistair', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Neviani P', 'Harb JG', 'Oaks JJ', 'Santhanam R', 'Walker CJ', 'Ellis JJ', 'Ferenchak G', 'Dorrance AM', 'Paisie CA', 'Eiring AM', 'Ma Y', 'Mao HC', 'Zhang B', 'Wunderlich M', 'May PC', 'Sun C', 'Saddoughi SA', 'Bielawski J', 'Blum W', 'Klisovic RB', 'Solt JA', 'Byrd JC', 'Volinia S', 'Cortes J', 'Huettner CS', 'Koschmieder S', 'Holyoake TL', 'Devine S', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Croce CM', 'Garzon R', 'Ogretmen B', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Chen CS', 'Bittman R', 'Hokland P', 'Roy DC', 'Milojkovic D', 'Apperley J', 'Goldman JM', 'Reid A', 'Mulloy JC', 'Bhatia R', 'Marcucci G', 'Perrotti D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130903,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Propylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2013/09/04 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/04 06:00'],"['2013/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['68951 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI68951 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Oct;123(10):4144-57. doi: 10.1172/JCI68951.

Side population (SP) functionality is a major characteristic of HSPCs related to quiescence and resistance to drugs and environmental stresses. At steady state, SP cells are mainly present in the BM and are mostly absent from the circulation except in stress conditions, raising the hypothesis of the versatility of the SP functionality. However, the mechanism of SP phenotype regulation is unclear. Here we show for the first time that the SP functionality can be induced in lin(-) cells from unmobilized peripheral blood after nesting on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This MSC-induced SP fraction contains HSPCs as demonstrated by their (i) CD34(+) cell percentage, (ii) quiescent status, (iii) in vitro proliferative and clonogenic potential, (iv) engraftment in NSG (NOD SCID gamma chain) mice and (v) stemness gene expression profile. We demonstrate that SP phenotype acquisition/reactivation by circulating lin(-) cells is dependent on interactions with MSCs through VLA-4/alpha4beta1-integrin and CD44. A similar integrin-dependent mechanism of SP phenotype acquisition in acute myeloid leukemia circulating blasts suggests an extrinsic regulation of ATP-binding cassette-transporter activity that could be of importance for a better understanding of adhesion-mediated chemoresistance mechanisms.",,"['Malfuson, J-V', 'Boutin, L', 'Clay, D', 'Thepenier, C', 'Desterke, C', 'Torossian, F', 'Guerton, B', 'Anginot, A', 'de Revel, T', 'Lataillade, J-J', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles, M-C']","['Malfuson JV', 'Boutin L', 'Clay D', 'Thepenier C', 'Desterke C', 'Torossian F', 'Guerton B', 'Anginot A', 'de Revel T', 'Lataillade JJ', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles MC']","[""1] Service d'hematologie, HIA Percy, Clamart, France [2] CTS des Armees, Clamart, France."", 'CTS des Armees, Clamart, France.', '1] Inserm U972, Villejuif, France [2] IFR89, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif, France.', 'CTS des Armees, Clamart, France.', '1] Inserm U972, Villejuif, France [2] Univ Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France.', '1] Inserm U972, Villejuif, France [2] Univ Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France.', '1] Inserm U972, Villejuif, France [2] Univ Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France.', '1] Inserm U972, Villejuif, France [2] Univ Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France.', ""1] Service d'hematologie, HIA Percy, Clamart, France [2] Ecole du Val de Grace, Paris, France."", '1] CTS des Armees, Clamart, France [2] Ecole du Val de Grace, Paris, France.', '1] Inserm U972, Villejuif, France [2] IFR89, Institut Andre Lwoff, Villejuif, France [3] Univ Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130903,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cd44 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*physiology', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/physiology']",,,2013/09/04 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/09/04 06:00'],"['2013/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013256 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.256 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):853-64. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.256.

AIMS: To study the spectrum of microorganisms and to compare the rates of infection. METHODS: A total of 42 ECs were inserted, including 28 Port-A-Caths, 11 CVC lines and 3 Hickman lines. Single ECs were required for 19 patients (45.2%), whereas 2, 3 and 4 ECs were required in 8, 1 and 1 patients, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 37 culture-documented infections were present in 18 (62%) patients who had ECs. Gram-positive microorganisms were identified in 20 cases, Gram-negative microorganisms in 14 cases and fungal infections in 3 cases. Of the 42 devices implanted, 10 out of 28 Port-A-Caths (35.7%), 2 out of 3 Hickman catheters (66.7%) and 9 out of 11 central venous catheters (81.8%) required removal due to infection. The average length of working life for the ports was 330.6 days (range: 40-1043 days). The median rate of complications due to infection was 2.84 infections per 1000 catheter days (interquartile range: -1.55 to 5.8), and the number of infections was correlated with the number of ports (Pearson's r=0.51; p<0.05).","['Copyright (c) 2013 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is involved in the efflux of several anticancer drugs, which leads to chemotherapy failure and multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Representative secondary metabolites (SM) including phenolics (EGCG and thymol), terpenoids (menthol, aromadendrene, beta-sitosterol-O-glucoside, and beta-carotene), and alkaloids (glaucine, harmine, and sanguinarine) were evaluated as potential P-gp inhibitors (transporter activity and expression level) in P-gp expressing Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 cancer cell lines. Selected SM increased the accumulation of the rhodamine 123 (Rho123) and calcein-AM (CAM) in a dose dependent manner in Caco-2 cells, indicating that they act as competitive inhibitors of P-gp. Non-toxic concentrations of beta-carotene (40muM) and sanguinarine (1muM) significantly inhibited Rho123 and CAM efflux in CEM/ADR5000 cells by 222.42% and 259.25% and by 244.02% and 290.16%, respectively relative to verapamil (100%). Combination of the saponin digitonin (5muM), which also inhibits P-gp, with SM significantly enhanced the inhibition of P-gp activity. The results were correlated with the data obtained from a quantitative analysis of MDR1 expression. Both compounds significantly decreased mRNA levels of the MDR1 gene to 48% (p<0.01) and 46% (p<0.01) in Caco-2, and to 61% (p<0.05) and 1% (p<0.001) in CEM/ADR5000 cells, respectively as compared to the untreated control (100%). Combinations of digitonin with SM resulted in a significant down-regulation of MDR1. Our findings provide evidence that the selected SM interfere directly and/or indirectly with P-gp function. Combinations of different P-gp substrates, such as digitonin alone and together with the set of SM, can mediate MDR reversal in cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.
