Epub 2013 Feb 21.,"Acute leukaemia in early childhood - and mainly infant leukaemia (IL) - is characterized by acquired genetic alterations, most commonly by the presence of distinct MLL rearrangements (MLL-r). The aim of this study was to investigate possible correlations between clinical features and molecular analyses of a series of 545 childhood leukaemia (</=24 months of age) cases: 385 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 160 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The location of the genomic breakpoints was determined in a subset of 30 MLL-r cases. The overall survival of the investigated cohort was 60.5%, as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Worse outcomes were associated with age at diagnosis </=6 months (P < 0.001), high white blood cell count (P = 0.001), and MLL-r (P = 0.002) in ALL, while children with AML displayed a poorer outcome (P = 0.009) regardless of their age strata. Moreover, we present first evidence that MLL-r patients with poor outcome preferentially displayed chromosomal breakpoints within MLL intron 11. Based on the literature, most MLL-r IL display a breakpoint localization towards intron 11, which in turn may explain their worse clinical course. In summary, the MLL breakpoint localization is of clinical importance and should be considered as a novel outcome predictor for MLL-r patients.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant Acute Leukaemia'],"['Thuler LC', 'Faro A', 'Andrade C', 'Pediatrico O', 'Cordoba JC', 'Mendonca N', 'Araujo FN', 'Burlachini LM', 'Dorea MD', 'Brandalise S', 'Pinheiro VR', 'Boldrini D', 'Ramos G', 'Neto JC', 'de Brito NP', 'Carvalho G', 'Silva AM', 'de Andrade Agareno JM', 'Lee ML', 'Dobbin J', 'Belo RD', 'Apa A', 'Baseggio R', 'de Souza MS', 'Mnayjari A', 'Nobrega AG', 'Salles TM', 'Costa Ed', 'de Souza AM', 'Rouxinol S', 'Land M', 'Coser VM', 'de Brito PC', 'Oliveira LS', 'Bariani C', 'Pianovski MA', 'Lafayette TC', 'Costa I', 'Bousfield D', 'Cardoso TC', 'de Almeida Wernerck F', 'Lopes LF', 'Arancibia AM', 'Melaragno R', 'Neves G', 'Cristofani LM', 'Gurgel RS']","['Thuler, Luiz Claudio Santos', 'Faro, Alessandra', 'Andrade, Camilla', 'Pediatrico, Oncologia', 'Cordoba, Jose Carlos', 'Mendonca, Nubia', 'Araujo, Flavia N Serafim', 'Burlachini, Lilian Maria', 'Dorea, Maria D', 'Brandalise, Silvia', 'Pinheiro, Vitoria R', 'Boldrini, Domingos', 'Ramos, Gilberto', 'Neto, Joaquim C Aguirre', 'de Brito, Nilma Pimentel', 'Carvalho, G', 'Silva, Ana M Marinho da', 'de Andrade Agareno, Jozina M', 'Lee, Maria Lucia Marinho', 'Dobbin, Jane', 'Belo, Reinaldo Dal', 'Apa, Alexandre', 'Baseggio, Rosania', 'de Souza, Marcelo Santos', 'Mnayjari, Atalla', 'Nobrega, Andrea Gadelha', 'Salles, Terezinha Marques', 'Costa, Elaine da', 'de Souza, Adriana Martins', 'Rouxinol, Soraya', 'Land, Marcelo', 'Coser, Virginia Maria', 'de Brito, Patricia Carneiro', 'Oliveira, Loretta S C', 'Bariani, Cesar', 'Pianovski, Mara A D', 'Lafayette, Thereza C S', 'Costa, Imarui', 'Bousfield, Denise', 'Cardoso, Teresa Cristina', 'de Almeida Wernerck, Fernando', 'Lopes, Luis Fernando', 'Arancibia, Alejandro M', 'Melaragno, Renato', 'Neves, Gustavo', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Gurgel, Renata S Carvalho']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapy with T-cells genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) represents an innovative approach. Here we investigated the targeting of the interleukin three receptor alpha (IL3RA; CD123) molecule, which is overexpressed on AML bulk population, CD34(+) leukaemia progenitors, and leukaemia stem cells (LSC) compared to normal haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and whose overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells were transduced with SFG-retroviral-vector encoding an anti-CD123 CAR. Transduced cells were able to strongly kill CD123(+) cell lines, as well as primary AML blasts. Interestingly, secondary colony experiments demonstrated that anti-CD123.CAR preserved in vitro HSPCs, in contrast to a previously generated anti-CD33.CAR, while keeping an identical cytotoxicity profile towards AML. Furthermore, limited killing of normal monocytes and CD123-low-expressing endothelial cells was noted, thus indicating a low toxicity profile of the anti-CD123.CAR. Taken together, our results indicate that CD123-specific CARs strongly enhance anti-AML CIK functions, while sparing HSPCs and normal low-expressing antigen cells, paving the way to develop novel immunotherapy approaches for AML treatment.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Centro di Ricerca Matilde Tettamanti, Department of Paediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.']",,,,['Br J Haematol. 2013 Aug;162(3):428'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prepared different fractions of this plant to investigate their inhibitory effects on two leukemia cell lines, Jurkat and K562. Fractions with the highest inhibitory effects were examined for induction of apoptosis by the annexin V/propidium iodide assay and cell cycle changes by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction evaluated the changes in expression of apoptosis-related genes. Among different fractions, dichloromethane and n-hexane dose-dependent showed the strongest inhibitory effects on both K562 and Jurkat cells. The dichloromethane fraction significantly induced apoptosis at concentration of 50 microg/ml on Jurkat (85.66 +/- 4.9%) and K562 cells (65.04 +/- 0.93%) at 24 h after treatment (p < 0.002). According to cell cycle analysis, more than 70% of the cells accumulated in the sub-G1 phase when cultured in the presence of the dichloromethane fraction. This fraction up-regulated Fas and Bax mRNA expression as well as the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio according to cell type, showing its effect on the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The expression of apoptosis-related genes did not significantly change following treatment with the n-hexane fraction.

Epub 2013 Mar 25.,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no randomized toxicity studies have been conducted to compare myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: Adult patients </=60 years of age with myeloid leukaemia were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to treatment with RIC (n = 18) or MAC (n = 19) in this Phase II single-centre toxicity study. RESULTS: There was a maximum median mucositis grade of 1 in the RIC group compared with 4 in the MAC group (P < 0.001). Haemorrhagic cystitis occurred in eight of the patients in the MAC group and none in the RIC group (P < 0.01). Results of renal and hepatic tests did not differ significantly between the two groups. RIC-treated patients had faster platelet engraftment (P < 0.01) and required fewer erythrocyte and platelet transfusions (P < 0.001) and less total parenteral nutrition (TPN) than those treated with MAC (P < 0.01). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was more common in the MAC group (14/19) than in the RIC group (6/18) (P = 0.02). Donor chimerism was similar in the two groups with regard to CD19 and CD33, but was delayed for CD3 in the RIC group. Five-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) was approximately 11% in both groups, and rates of relapse and survival were not significantly different. Patients in the MAC group with intermediate cytogenetic acute myeloid leukaemia had a 3-year survival of 73%, compared with 90% among those in the RIC group. CONCLUSION: Reduced-intensity conditioning had several advantages compared with MAC, including less mucositis, less haemorrhagic cystitis, faster platelet engraftment, the need for fewer transfusions and less TPN, and fewer CMV infections. Both regimens were tolerated and TRM was low.",['(c) 2013 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],"['Division of Therapeutic Immunology and Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Epub 2013 Feb 21.,"Although BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors reliably induce disease remission for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), unlimited extension of therapy is necessary to prevent relapse from persistent leukaemic cells. Here, we analysed model cell lines and primary CML cells for the expression and functions of the ABC transporter A3 (ABCA3) as well as the embryonic stem cell-associated transcription factor SALL4. ABCA3 protected leukaemic cells from the cytotoxic effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. In the surviving cells, exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors significantly enhanced ABCA3 expression in vivo and in vitro, and was associated with increased expression of SALL4, which binds the ABCA3 promoter. Inhibition of ABCA3 or SALL4 by genetic silencing or indomethacin, but not interferon gamma, interrupted SALL4-dependent regulation of ABCA3 and restored susceptibility of leukaemic cells to tyrosine kinase inhibition. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor exposure facilitates a protective loop of SALL4 and ABCA3 cooperation in persistent leukaemic cells.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 25.,"The chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), including polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by dysregulated haematopoietic stem cell expansion and production of red cells, white cells and platelets alone or in combination. An acquired mutation JAK2(V617F) can be found in all three disorders and shows many of the phenotypic abnormalities of the diseases in murine models. The disease phenotype is also influenced by other unknown genetic or epigenetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are 18-24 nucleotide single-stranded non-protein-coding RNAs that function primarily as gene repressors by binding to their target messenger RNAs. There is growing evidence that miRNAs regulate haematopoiesis in both haematopoietic stem cells and committed progenitor cells. Here, we review the field of miRNA biology and its regulatory roles in normal haematopoiesis with an emphasis on miRNA deregulations in MPNs. Continued research into how miRNAs impact JAK2(V617F) clonal expansion, differential haematopoiesis among different MPNs, disease progression and leukaemia transformation will lead to a better understanding of the development of these disorders, their clinical manifestations, and their treatment.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['James J.

We established that quaternary ammonium salt moieties carrying highly hindered, positive electronic charges located to the plasma membrane. A ten-carbon chain linked to these moieties was effective at positioning the redox-active ubiquinone-like function within the lipid bilayer to disrupt tPMET in human leukemic cells (IC50 9 +/- 1 muM). TPMET inhibition alone was not sufficient to induce significant cell death, but positively charged compounds could also enter the cell and disrupt intracellular redox balance, distinct from their effects on mitochondrial electron transport.

Single cell network profiling (SCNP) is a multiparametric flow cytometry based assay that simultaneously measures, in a quantitative fashion and at the single cell level, both extracellular surface marker levels and changes in intracellular signaling proteins in response to extracellular modulators. We previously reported an initial characterization of FLT3 ITD-mediated signaling using SCNP. Herein SCNP was applied sequentially to two separate cohorts of samples collected from elderly AML patients at diagnosis. In the first (training) study, AML samples carrying unmutated, wild-type FLT3 (FLT3 WT) displayed a wide range of induced signaling, with a fraction having signaling profiles comparable to FLT3 ITD AML samples. Conversely, the FLT3 ITD AML samples displayed more homogeneous induced signaling, with the exception of patients with low (<40%) mutational load, which had profiles comparable to FLT3 WT AML samples. This observation was then confirmed in an independent (verification) cohort. Data from the second cohort were also used to assess the association between SCNP data and disease-free survival (DFS) in the context of FLT3 and nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutational status among patients who achieved complete remission (CR) to induction chemotherapy. The combination of SCNP read outs together with FLT3 and NPM1 molecular status improved the DFS prediction accuracy of the latter. Taken together, these results emphasize the value of comprehensive functional assessment of biologically relevant signaling pathways in AML as a basis for the development of highly predictive tests for guidance of post-remission therapy.",,"['Nodality, Inc, South San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",,,,,,,['U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3576376,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analyses indicated that 6 of the 13 natural products predicted binding proteins which were important targets for established cancer treatments. Improvements in effectiveness were predicted for artificial combinations of 2 or 3 natural products.

This process occurs through the upregulation of crucial antiapoptotic genes, in particular, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1). Here, we investigated the underlying mechanism and signal transduction pathways leading to increased MCL-1 expression in infected macrophages. Live S. aureus not only stimulated de novo synthesis of Mcl-1, but also prolonged the stability of this antiapoptotic protein. Consistent with this, we proved a crucial role of Mcl-1 in S. aureus-induced cytoprotection, since silencing of MCL1 by siRNA profoundly reversed the cytoprotection of infected cells leading to apoptosis. Increased MCL1 expression in infected cells was associated with enhanced NFkappaB activation and subsequent IL-6 secretion, since the inhibition of both NFkappaB and IL-6 signalling pathways abrogated Mcl-1 induction and cytoprotection. Finally, we confirmed our observation in vivo in murine model of septic arthritis showing the association between the severity of arthritis and Mcl-1 expression. Therefore, we propose that S. aureus is hijacking the Mcl-1-dependent inhibition of apoptosis to prevent the elimination of infected host cells, thus allowing the intracellular persistence of the pathogen, its dissemination by infected macrophages, and the progression of staphylococci diseases.",,"['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Ul.

We previously reported that MOZ directly interacts with p53 and is essential for p53-dependent selective regulation of p21 expression. We show here that MOZ is an acetyltransferase of p53 at K120 and K382 and colocalizes with p53 in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies following cellular stress. The MOZ-PML-p53 interaction enhances MOZ-mediated acetylation of p53, and this ternary complex enhances p53-dependent p21 expression. Moreover, we identified an Akt/protein kinase B recognition sequence in the PML-binding domain of MOZ protein. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of MOZ at T369 has a negative effect on complex formation between PML and MOZ.

Epub 2013 Feb 21.,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling, SOCS1 and SOCS3, are important negative regulators of Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling, which is constitutively activated in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and leukemia. Curcumin has been shown to possess anticancer activity through different mechanisms. However, whether curcumin can regulate the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 is still unknown. Here, we found that curcumin elevated the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 via triggering acetylation of histone in the regions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 promoter in K562 and HEL cells. As a novel histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor, curcumin inhibited HDAC enzyme activities and decreased the levels of HDAC1, 3 and 8 but not HDAC2. Knockdown of HDAC8 by small interfering RNA markedly elevated the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Moreover, ectopic expression of HDAC8 decreased the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Thus, HDAC8 plays an important role in the modulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 by curcumin. Also, trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDACs, increased the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Furthermore, curcumin increased the transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and significantly inhibited the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with MPNs. Finally, curcumin markedly inhibited HDAC activities and decreased HDAC8 levels in primary MPN cells. Taken together, our data uncover a regulatory mechanism of SOCS1 and SOCS3 through inhibition of HDAC activity (especially HDAC8) by curcumin. Thus, being a relative non-toxic agent, curcumin may offer a therapeutic advantage in the clinical treatment for MPNs.",,"['Laboratory of Internal Medicine and 2Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 2 FuXue Road, Wenzhou 325000, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a retrospective cross sectional study on 36 patients (9 Autologous transplantation group and 27 Allogeneic transplantation group) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital from May to August 2010. To assess oral intake and parenteral nutrition intake, 24-hour recall method and patient's charts review was performed. Nutritional status was measured with the scored patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA). The subjects consisted of 6 (66.7%) males and 3 (33.3%) females in the autologous transplantation group (auto), 12 (44.4%) males and 15 (55.6%) females in the allogeneic transplantation group (allo). The mean age was 40.9 +/- 13.6 years (auto) and 37.8 +/- 11.0 years (allo). The average hospitalized period was 25.2 +/- 3.5 days (auto) and 31.6 +/- 6.6 days (allo), which were significant different (p < 0.05). Nutritional intake was lowest at Post+1wk in two groups. In addition, calorie intake by oral diet to recommended intake at Post+2wk was low (20.8% auto and 20.5% allo) but there were no significant differences in change of nutritional intake over time (Admission, Pre-1day, Post+1wk, Post+2wk) between auto group and allo group by repeated measures ANOVA test. The result of nutritional assessment through PG-SGA was significantly different at Pre-1day only (p < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between the nutritional status during Post+2wk and the oral calorie/protein intake to recommended amount measured during Post+1wk and Post+2wk (p < 0.01).

The systemic levels of various chemokines may therefore reflect local disease processes, and such variations may thereby be used in the routine clinical handling of patients. The experience from patients with myeloproliferative diseases, and especially patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggests that systemic plasma/serum cytokine profiles can be useful, both as a diagnostic tool and for prognostication of patients. However, cytokines/chemokines are released by a wide range of cells and are involved in a wide range of biological processes; the altered levels may therefore mainly reflect the strength and nature of the biological processes, and the optimal clinical use of chemokine/cytokine analyses may therefore require combination with organ-specific biomarkers. Chemokine levels are also altered by clinical procedures, therapeutic interventions and the general status of the patients. A careful standardization of sample collection is therefore important, and the interpretation of the observations will require that the overall clinical context is considered.

Pegylation of asparaginase extends its biological half-life and has been introduced in the newest treatment protocols aiming to further increase treatment success. Hyperammonemia is a recognized side effect of asparaginase treatment, but little is known about its incidence and clinical relevance. Alerted by a patient with severe hyperammonemia after introduction of the new acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol, we analyzed blood samples and clinical data of eight consecutive patients receiving pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) during their treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All patients showed hyperammonemia (>50 mumol/L) and seven patients (88 %) showed ammonia concentrations > 100 mumol/L. Maximum ammonia concentrations ranged from 89 to 400 mumol/L. Symptoms varied from mild anorexia and nausea to headache, vomiting, dizziness, and lethargy and led to early interruption of PEG-asparaginase in three patients. No evidence of urea cycle malfunction was found, so overproduction of ammonia through hydrolysis of plasma asparagine and glutamine seems to be the main cause. Interestingly, ammonia concentrations correlated with triglyceride values (r = 0.68, p < 0.0001), suggesting increased overall toxicity.The prolonged half-life of PEG-asparaginase may be responsible for the high incidence of hyperammonemia and warrants future studies to define optimal dosing schedules based on ammonia concentrations and individual asparagine and asparaginase measurements.",,"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht/Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Room number KC 03.063.0, 85090, 3508 AB, Utrecht, The Netherlands, kheitink@umcutrecht.nl.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3575055,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual ASCs generated colony-forming unit-fibroblast at a high frequency and could differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes in vitro. Expansion of ASCs in a large quantity was feasible in medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-2 and leukemia inhibitory factor, without loss of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity. Moreover, we found that the transplanted ASCs can differentiate into adipocytes in adipogenic microenvironment in vivo and osteoblasts in osteogenic microenvironment in vivo. Thus we proved that Lin, CD271, and Sca-1 could be used as the specific markers to purify ASCs from adipose tissue.

Epub 2013 Feb 22.,"The ability to modulate balance between cell survival and death is recognized for its great therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on elucidation of cell machinery and signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and apoptosis. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents often have a cytostatic effect over tumor cells. New natural or synthetic chemotherapeutic agents have a wider spectrum of interesting antitumor activities that merit in-depth studies. In the present work, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanism leading to induction of cell death upon treatment of the lymphoblastoid cell line PL104 with caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE), MG132 and two conventional chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicine (DOX) and vincristine (VCR). Our results showed several apoptotic hallmarks such as phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, nuclear fragmentation, and increase sub-G1 DNA content after all treatments. In addition, all four drugs downregulated survivin expression. CAPE and both chemotherapeutic agents reduced Bcl-2, while only CAPE and MG132 significantly increased Bax level. CAPE and VCR treatment induced the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (psim). All compounds induced cytochrome c release from mitochondrial compartment to cytosol. However, only MG132 caused the translocation of Smac/DIABLO. Except for VCR treatment, all other drugs increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production level. All treatments induced activation of caspases 3/7, but only CAPE and MG132 led to the activation of caspase 9. In conclusion, our results indicate that CAPE and MG132 treatment of PL104 cells induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway, whereas the apoptotic mechanism induced by DOX and VCR may proceed through the extrinsic pathway.",,"['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Tumoral (LIT), IDEHU-CONICET, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina, vcavaliere@ffyb.uba.ar.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1) is a costimulatory and adhesion molecule, expressed mainly by natural killer cells and CD8(+) T cells at steady state to promote adhesion to ligand-expressing targets and enhance cytolysis. We have analyzed the role of this pathway in GVHD and GVL. The absence of DNAM-1 on the donor graft attenuated GVHD in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched and MHC-matched BMT following conditioning with lethal and sublethal irradiation. In contrast, DNAM-1 was not critical for GVL effects against ligand (CD155) expressing and nonexpressing leukemia. The effects on GVHD following myeloablative conditioning were independent of CD8(+) T cells and dependent on CD4(+) T cells, and specifically donor FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). The absence of DNAM-1 promoted the expansion and suppressive function of Treg after BMT.

As a result, SAP-deficient humans and mice lack iNKT cells. The strict developmental requirement for SAP has made it difficult to discern its possible involvement in mature iNKT cell functions. By using temporal Cre recombinase-mediated gene deletion to ablate SAP expression after completion of iNKT cell development, we demonstrate that SAP is essential for T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced iNKT cell cytotoxicity against T-cell and B-cell leukemia targets in vitro and iNKT-cell-mediated control of T-cell leukemia growth in vivo. These findings are not restricted to the murine system: silencing RNA-mediated suppression of SAP expression in human iNKT cells also significantly impairs TCR-induced cytolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that iNKT cell killing requires the tyrosine kinase Fyn, a known SAP-binding protein. Furthermore, SAP expression is required within iNKT cells to facilitate their interaction with T-cell targets and induce reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center to the immunologic synapse (IS). Collectively, these studies highlight a novel and essential role for SAP during iNKT cell cytotoxicity and formation of a functional IS.",,"[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",,,,,,,"['CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'R01 AI067946/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL089745/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089745/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 AI084669/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA166184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3637014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of pro-IL-1beta, NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1 was not affected in Pml(-/-) macrophages. PML deficiency selectively reduced the processing of procaspase-1. We further showed that PML is required for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome in reconstitution experiment. All PML isoforms were capable of stimulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In Pml(-/-) macrophages, the generation of reactive oxygen species and release of mitochondrial DNA were decreased. The involvement of PML in inflammasome activation constitutes an important activity of PML and reveals a new mechanism underlying the inflammasome activation.

Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 ""gatekeeper"" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations. On the basis of its in vitro activity against FLT3 TKI-resistant F691 substitutions, further clinical evaluation of ponatinib in TKI-naive and select TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML patients is warranted.

GP7 and etoposide inhibited the proliferation of a panel of mouse and human OS cells in a concentration- or time-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effect of GP7 on the proliferation of mouse LM8 or human U2OS cells was 1.28- or 1.35-fold higher than that of etoposide.

GP7 arrested the cell cycle in S phase but etoposide in G(2)/M phase. GP7 or etoposide induced sub-G(1) peak, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, activations of caspase-3, -8, -9, and DNA fragmentation factor, downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, upregulation of Bax and Bak, and cytochrome-c release from mitochondria in both mouse and human OS cells.

Epub 2013 Feb 20.,"The Life Span Study of atomic bomb survivors is an important source of risk estimates used to inform radiation protection and compensation. Interviews with survivors in the 1950s and 1960s provided information needed to estimate radiation doses for survivors proximal to ground zero. Because of a lack of interview or the complexity of shielding, doses are missing for 7,058 of the 68,119 proximal survivors. Recent analyses excluded people with missing doses, and despite the protracted collection of interview information necessary to estimate some survivors' doses, defined start of follow-up as October 1, 1950, for everyone. We describe the prevalence of missing doses and its association with mortality, distance from hypocenter, city, age, and sex. Missing doses were more common among Nagasaki residents than among Hiroshima residents (prevalence ratio = 2.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.96, 2.14), among people who were closer to ground zero than among those who were far from it, among people who were younger at enrollment than among those who were older, and among males than among females (prevalence ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.28). Missing dose was associated with all-cancer and leukemia mortality, particularly during the first years of follow-up (all-cancer rate ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.51, 3.08; and leukemia rate ratio = 4.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.72, 10.67).

Epub 2013 Feb 22.,"Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a small B-cell neoplasm whose molecular pathogenesis is still essentially unknown and whose differentiation from other small B-cell lymphomas is hampered by the lack of specific markers. We have analyzed the gene expression and miRNA profiles of 31 splenic marginal zone lymphoma cases. For comparison, 7 spleens with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, 10 spleens infiltrated by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 12 spleens with follicular lymphoma, 6 spleens infiltrated by mantle cell lymphoma and 15 lymph nodes infiltrated by nodal marginal zone lymphoma were included. The results were validated by qRT-PCR in an independent series including 77 paraffin-embedded splenic marginal zone lymphomas. The splenic marginal zone lymphoma miRNA signature had deregulated expression of 51 miRNAs. The most highly overexpressed miRNAs were miR-155, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-193b and miR-100, while the most repressed miRNAs were miR-377, miR-27b, miR-145, miR-376a and miR-424. MiRNAs located in 14q32-31 were underexpressed in splenic marginal zone lymphoma compared with reactive lymphoid tissues and other B-cell lymphomas. Finally, the gene expression data were integrated with the miRNA profile to identify functional relationships between genes and deregulated miRNAs. Our study reveals miRNAs that are deregulated in splenic marginal zone lymphoma and identifies new candidate diagnostic molecules for splenic marginal zone lymphoma.",,"['Genetics Department, Virgen de la Salud Hospital, Toledo, CP 45004 Spain. aarribas@sescam.jccm.es']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the Sirtuin class of protein deacetylases with activation of p53 function is associated with the pro-apoptotic effects of Tnv-6 in many tumors. Here, we demonstrate that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, Tnv-6 causes non-genotoxic cytotoxicity, without adversely affecting human clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors in vitro, or murine hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, exposure of CLL cells to Tnv-6 did not induce cellular apoptosis or p53-pathway activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified a gene program influenced by Tnv-6 that included autophagy-lysosomal pathway genes. The dysregulation of autophagy was confirmed by changes in cellular ultrastructure and increases in the autophagy-regulatory proteins LC3 (LC3-II) and p62/Sequestosome. Adding bafilomycin-A1, an autophagy inhibitor to Tnv-6 containing cultures did not cause synergistic accumulation of LC3-II, suggesting inhibition of late-stage autophagy by Tnv-6.

We herein show that treatment with a potent inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, ABT-737, triggers caspase-dependent induction of the BH3-only protein, Mcl-1 inhibitor, Noxa. RNA interference experiments reveal that induction of Noxa, and subsequent cell death, rely not only on the transcription factor E2F-1 but also on its regulator pRb. In response to ABT-737, pRb is cleaved by caspases into a p68Rb form that still interacts with E2F-1. Moreover, pRb occupies the noxa promoter together with E2F-1, in a caspase-dependent manner upon ABT-737 treatment. Thus, caspases contribute to trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by coupling Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition to that of Mcl-1, via the pRb/E2F-1-dependent induction of Noxa.",,"[""UMR 892 INSERM/6299 CNRS/Universite de Nantes, Team 8 Cell survival and tumor escape in breast cancer, Institut de Recherche en Sante de l'Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3619243,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative activity of four triterpenes derived from E. japonica, including corosolic acid (CA), ursolic acid (UA), maslinic acid (MA) and oleanolic acid (OA), in human leukemia cell lines. CA showed the strongest anti-proliferative activity in all of the leukemia cell lines tested, but not in normal human skin fibroblast cell lines. To determine the mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effect of CA, we examined the effect of CA on molecular events known as apoptosis induction. CA induced chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, sub-G(1) phase DNA, activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 and the cleavage of PARP in HL-60. CA also activated Bid and Bax, leading to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (psi(m)) and cytochrome c release into the cytosol, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were unaffected by CA. These results suggest that CA has an anti-proliferative effect on leukemia cells via the induction of apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation.

Bioinformatics analysis reveals a conserved target site for miR-29b in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of ABL1. miR-29b significantly suppresses the activity of a luciferase reporter containing ABL1-3'UTR and this activity is not observed in cells transfected with mutated ABL1-3'UTR. Enforced expression of miR-29b in K562 cells inhibits cell growth and colony formation ability thereby inducing apoptosis through cleavage of procaspase 3 and PARP. Furthermore, K562 cells transfected with a siRNA targeting ABL1 show similar growth and apoptosis phenotypes as cells overexpression of miR-29b.

Epub 2013 Feb 21.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hypogammaglobulinemia who suffer from recurrent infections can be offered prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) substitution. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of pure IgG subclass deficiency (with normal Ig levels), its correlation to risk of infection, and the clinical value of routine measurement of serum IgG subclass levels in patients with CLL. METHODS: Serum levels of Ig and IgG subclasses were determined in patients with CLL at Uppsala University Hospital. Clinical data were collected through patient records and questionnaires. RESULTS: Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 52.3% out of 111 patients. These patients did not have a higher annual risk of infection than patients without hypogammaglobulinemia (79.5% vs 79.1%, p = 0.706 for all infections; 13.4% vs 11.2%, p = 0.394 for severe infection; and 1.7% vs 3.4%, p = 0.083 for sepsis). Pure subclass deficiency was uncommon and occurred in 6 patients (5.4%). The annual overall risk of infection, of severe infection, and of sepsis for these patients did not differ as compared to patients with no hypogammaglobulinemia and no subclass deficiency (70.8% vs 80.7%, p = 0.334; 11.8% vs 11.1%, p = 0.497; and 8.9% vs 2.3%, p = 0.067, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pure IgG subclass deficiency is rare in patients with CLL. In this heterogeneous cohort of patients, neither hypogammaglobulinemia nor pure IgG subclass deficiency were significant risk factors for infectious complications. Measurement of serum levels of Ig may be justified in patients with recurrent severe infections, but routine analysis of IgG subclass levels in patients with CLL is probably not warranted.",,"['Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. tobias.svensson@akademiska.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Scand J Infect Dis. 2013 Sep;45(9):729.

We demonstrated that DICER1 was overexpressed in AML patients and leukemia cell lines by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. A functional assay demonstrated that the silencing of DICER1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. We also demonstrated that DICER1 was upregulated by the hematopoietic transcription factor, GATA1, through luciferase, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These data suggest that DICER1 plays an important role in AML and the finding that the upregulation of DICER1 is induced by GATA1 may provide a framework for the understanding of differential DICER1 expression levels in multiple types of cancer.",,"['Department of Medical Genetics, China Medical University, Shenyang, P.R.

Epub 2013 Feb 20.,"AML1-ETO (RUNX1-ETO) fusion proteins are generated by the 8;21 translocation, commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia, which fuses the AML1 (RUNX1) and ETO (MTG8, RUNX1T1) genes. Previous studies have shown that AML1-ETO interferes with AML1 function but requires additional cooperating mutations to induce leukemia development. In mouse models, AML1-ETO forms lacking the C-terminus have been shown to have greatly enhanced leukemogenic potential. Here, we investigate the role of 2 AML1-ETO C-terminal-interacting proteins, N-CoR, a transcriptional corepressor, and SON, a splicing/transcription factor required for cell cycle progression, in AML1-ETO-induced leukemia development. AML1-ETO-W692A loses N-CoR binding at NHR4, displays attenuated transcriptional repression ability and decreased cellular dysregulation, and promotes leukemia in vivo. These results support the importance of the degree of dysregulation by AML1-ETO in cellular transformation and demonstrate that AML1-ETO-W692A can be used as an effective experimental model for determining which factors compromise the leukemogenic potential of AML1-ETO.",,"['Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",,,,,,,"['CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32GM007240/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007240/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3643768,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a biologically active eicosanoid with specific anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties, was recently found to be a novel modulator of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). In this study, we investigated the potential role of LXA4 in implantation. We found that LXA4 blocked embryo implantation in mice and significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators associated with uterine receptivity and embryo implantation, including corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), cyclooxygenase 2-derived prostaglandin I2 and prostaglandin E2, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 6, but this effect was independent of LXA4 receptor. Subsequent investigation revealed enhanced ERalpha activity in the uteri of LXA4-treated mice during the peri-implantation period. ERalpha and phosphorylated ERalpha were significantly increased following LXA4 treatment. Finally, it was demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of LXA4 on embryo implantation was mediated through ERalpha. In the presence of the ERalpha antagonist ICI 182 780, LXA4 failed to block embryo implantation. LXA4 also failed to inhibit CRF expression. These results suggested that LXA4 blocks embryo implantation by controlling ERalpha activity, and this effect appeared to be related to the suppression of the inflammatory microenvironment necessary for implantation.",,"['Institute of Pathology, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan 430030, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent research has suggested that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a role in regulating the gene expression program linked to memory formation. The contribution of histone methylation, an important regulatory mechanism of chromatin plasticity that is mediated by the counteracting activity of histone-methyltransferases and histone-demethylases, is, however, not well understood. Here we show that mice lacking the histone-methyltransferase myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 2 (mll2/kmt2b) gene in adult forebrain excitatory neurons display impaired hippocampus-dependent memory function. Consistent with the role of KMT2B in gene-activation DNA microarray analysis revealed that 152 genes were downregulated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region of mice lacking kmt2b. Downregulated plasticity genes showed a specific deficit in histone 3 lysine 4 di- and trimethylation, while histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation was not affected.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of SAR3419, an antibody-drug conjugate of the maytansinoid DM4 and a humanized anti-CD19 antibody, against B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and infant mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) xenografts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ALL xenografts were established as systemic disease in immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice from direct patient explants. SAR3419 was administered as a single agent and in combination with an induction-type regimen of vincristine/dexamethasone/l-asparaginase (VXL). Leukemia progression and response to treatment were assessed in real-time, and responses were evaluated using strict criteria modeled after the clinical setting. RESULTS: SAR3419 significantly delayed the progression of 4 of 4 CD19(+) BCP-ALL and 3 of 3 MLL-ALL xenografts, induced objective responses in all but one xenograft but was ineffective against T-lineage ALL xenografts. Relative surface CD19 expression across the xenograft panel significantly correlated with leukemia progression delay and objective response measure scores. SAR3419 also exerted significant efficacy against chemoresistant BCP-ALL xenografts over a large (10-fold) dose range and significantly enhanced VXL-induced leukemia progression delay in two highly chemoresistant xenografts by up to 82 days. When administered as protracted therapy following remission induction with VXL, SAR3419 prevented disease recurrence into hematolymphoid and other major organs with the notable exception of central nervous system involvement. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that incorporation of SAR3419 into remission induction protocols may improve the outcome for high-risk pediatric and adult CD19(+) ALL.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jun 1;19(11):3108'],,,"['N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-91001-03/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3618498,['NIHMS447751'],,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01440179'],,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 21.,"Darinaparsin (Dar) is a more potent cytotoxic arsenical than arsenic trioxide (ATO). We hypothesized that the increased cytotoxicity of Dar may be because of a decreased cytoprotective response. We observed that, unlike ATO, Dar does not induce heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), even though it induces expression of other nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2)-dependent detoxifying enzymes to a greater extent than ATO, in both cancer cell lines and patient-derived leukemic cells. This strengthens the emerging evidence, showing that response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) is stimuli specific. Dar treatment prevents recruitment of the transcriptional coregulator Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) to the HMOX1 promoter, which is required for HMOX1 expression. The inability of Dar to induce HO-1 correlates with arrest in G2/M cell cycle phase and BRG1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of HO-1 increases the toxicity of ATO, but has no effect on Dar-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, the lack of HO-1 induction is involved in Dar's enhanced antileukemic properties. Our data highlight cytoprotective responses mediated by HO-1 and BRG1 as a novel target for enhancing the therapeutic range of arsenicals.",,"['1] Department of Oncology, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Segal Cancer Center, Sir Mortimer B.

Ten patients (4 men and 6 women; median age, 57 y) with B-NHL who were initially CD20 positive and became CD20 negative after rituximab therapy were analyzed. Clinicopathologic features, including clinical course, CD20 expression, and histopathology, were examined. CD20 expression in lymphoma cells was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry. Histopathologically, diagnosis at initial presentation was follicular lymphoma (FL) in 7 patients; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 1; and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2. Six patients (60%, 3 FL, 1 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 2 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients) showed continuous CD20 negativity until 24 months after the phenotypic change. Three patients (30%) with FL regained CD20 expression within 1 to 7 months after detection of the CD20 change. Two patients (20%) with FL, including 1 who regained CD20 expression, showed heterogenous CD20 expression with a CD20-negative low-grade component and a CD20-positive large cell component. The overall response rate to therapy before the CD20-negative change was 70%. We reported the follow-up data of 10 B-NHL patients with a CD20-negative phenotypic change associated with rituximab-containing therapy.

The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the direct and indirect costs of CLL in Germany from the perspective of the sickness funds and society and analyze the burden of the disease. METHODS: Using a database of 7.6 million enrolled individuals, we identified 4198 CLL patients in 2007 and 2008. The costs attributable to CLL were estimated using a case-control design with a randomly selected control group of 150 individuals per combination of age and sex. We used the bootstrap approach to estimate uncertainties in costs estimated. We employed generalized estimating equation regression models and count data models to test for differences in costs and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: The cost attributable to CLL for each prevalent case amounts to euro4946 from the payer's perspective and euro7910 from a societal perspective. Inpatient hospital stays and pharmaceuticals are the main cost drivers of the disease. The economic burden of disease in Germany was estimated to be approximately euro201 million per year for the sickness funds and euro322 million for society. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with common diseases, such as diabetes or COPD, the economic burden of CLL is considerably lower. However, the cost of treatment per case is about twice as high as the cost per case for these common diseases, even though treatment is only performed in the later stages of CLL. With new healthcare technologies, the aging population, and the increasing incidence of the disease, it is likely that the economic burden of the disease will continue to grow.",,"['Hamburg Center for Health Economics, Universitat Hamburg, Esplanade 36, D-20354, Hamburg, Germany. rudolf.blankart@wiso.uni-hamburg.de']",,,,,,,,PMC3598307,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to explore the clinical significance of leukemia cell differentiation stages in patients with T-ALL. METHODS: We analyzed 36 adult T-ALL patients, including six patients (17%) in pro-T stage, 16 (44%) in pre-T stage, three (8%) in cortical-T stage, and 11 (31%) in medullary-T stage. Pro-T and pre-T stages were arbitrarily clustered as the immature group, and cortical-T and medullary-T stages as the mature group. RESULTS: Patients in the immature group had unique presentations, including lower lactate dehydrogenase levels, lower frequency of mediastinal tumor, and higher expression of myeloid antigens than the mature group. There was no difference in the treatment strategies between both groups. Although patients in the immature group had a lower complete remission (CR) rate when compared with the mature group (45% vs. 79%, respectively; P = 0.04), the 3-yr overall survival (OS) for both groups was comparable (27% vs. 38%, respectively; P = 0.66). Such discrepancy between the CR rates and the OS could be partially explained by survival benefit of allogeneic transplantation observed in the immature group but not in the mature group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that T-ALL patients can be categorized into two biologically distinctive subgroups according to the differentiation stages, and this stratification might enable prospective identification of patients with poor chemotherapy response.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan. hiroakis@ked.biglobe.ne.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Aug 28.,"Over the past 3 years, ibrutinib (PCI-32765) has emerged as a breakthrough in targeted therapy for patients with certain types of B cell malignancies. Early stage clinical trials found ibrutinib to be particularly active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), providing the rationale for ongoing phase 3 trials. In contrast to conventional chemo-immunotherapy, ibrutinib is not myelosuppressive, and responses are not affected by disease features that predict failure to respond to or short remission durations after chemo-immunotherapy, such as del17p. In CLL, ibrutinib characteristically causes an early redistribution of tissue-resident CLL cells into the blood, with rapid resolution of enlarged lymph nodes, along with a surge in lymphocytosis. Later, after weeks to months of continuous ibrutinib therapy, the growth- and survival-inhibitory activities of ibrutinib result in the normalization of lymphocyte counts and remissions in a majority of patients.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells, the third most common cancer of the blood after lymphoma and leukaemia. There are several published reports on miRNAs in MM, however most used bone marrow rather than peripheral blood samples. The aim of this study is to characterise miRNA expression in normal and MM patients using peripheral blood samples as it is less invasive and is readily available from patients. Blood samples from 35 MM patients were analysed using the microarray method. We identified up-regulation of 36 miRNAs (57%) and down-regulation of 27 miRNAs (43%). We also identified the CCND2, HMGA2 and IGF1R genes were among the highly predictive target genes (P(CT) > 0.80) for most of the deregulated miRNAs. These genes are known to play important roles in MM as well as other cancers. Five miRNAs (let-7c, miR-16, miR- 449, miR-181a and miR-181b) were found to exhibit similar expression patterns (p < 0.05) in peripheral blood when compared to data obtained by using bone marrow aspirates from MM patients in other studies. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that miRNAs are also present and differentially expressed in the peripheral blood of MM patients compared to controls and may potentially serve as candidate tumour biomarkers in MM. In particular, let-7c and miR-16 have been shown to be significantly expressed in the bone marrow.",,"['Molecular Diagnostics and Protein Unit, Specialised Diagnostics Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur. yusnita@imr.gov.my']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 19.,"BACKGROUND: Bone marrow (BM) biopsies from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may show reticulin fibrosis at diagnosis, but its significance remains unclear. This study sought to assess the prognostic impact of BM reticulin fibrosis in patients with previously untreated CLL. METHODS: Data was reviewed from untreated CLL patients in the national Israel CLL database, followed during 1987 to 2012. All bone marrow biopsies were graded for reticulin fibrosis using a modified scoring system containing 4 grades (0-3), based on the European consensus report. Grade of reticulin fibrosis was correlated with overall survival (OS), outcome, and a number of well-recognized prognostic factors for CLL. RESULTS: The final cohort included 176 patients (122 males and 51 females). Median age was 63 years (range, 32-86 years) and the 5-year OS was 77.1%. Grade of BM reticulin fibrosis correlated with OS (P < .0001) and mortality (P = .001), and separated patients into 2 groups with different survival curves. Advanced reticulin fibrosis (grades 2-3) was associated with thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of < 100,000/mm(3) ) (P = .025), anemia (P = .018), elevated beta2-microglobulin < 4000 mug/mL (P = .048), and the presence of 11q deletion (P = .0015). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant correlation between poor survival and grade of BM reticulin fibrosis. This staining procedure is easy to perform and can readily be added routinely when examining BM biopsies in CLL, because the findings do have prognostic implications.",['Copyright (c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],"['Hematology Unit, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. tamar.tadmor@b-zion.org.il']",['Israeli CLL Study Group'],,,"['Cancer. 2013 Sep 1;119(17):3256.

However, no head to head evidence exists of the relative efficacy of dasatinib and nilotinib. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and used the data extracted to perform an indirect comparison meta-analysis of the three interventions. RESULTS: Data from eight clinical studies (3,520 individuals) were included, all of which were of good quality (low risk of bias). At six months, the odds of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) for dasatinib and nilotinib were approximately three times those for imatinib (range 2.77 to 3.06, all values not significant). At twelve months datatinib and nilotinib were significantly better than imatinib for both CCyR and major molecular response (MMR) (CCyR odds range 2.06 to 2.41, MMR odds range 2.09 to 2.87). At eighteen months dasatinib and nilotinib were again significantly better in terms of CCyR than imatinib (response odds 1.55 to 2.01). When dasatinib and nilotinib were compared to each other, for both clinical endpoints at all time points the response odds were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a systematic review of the current literature base, dasatinib 100 mg, nilotinib 600 mg and nilotinib 800 mg should be viewed as equivalent in terms of complete cytogenetic and major molecular response.",,"['Oxford Outcomes Ltd Seacourt Tower, West Way, Oxford, UK. stuart.mealing@oxfordoutcomes.com.']",,,,,,,,PMC3585848,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: The data cited in this review were obtained from articles listed in Medline and Pubmed. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed the articles of clinical results from various registries and institutions, as well as our experiences with CBT in children, adolescents and adults. RESULTS: This research has clearly shown that cord blood (CB) has several unique characteristics resulting in distinct advantage and disadvantages when compared to transplantation with unrelated donor bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. The field of CBT has advanced from investigating its safety and feasibility to addressing more specific issues such as accelerating engraftment, extending access, and examining outcomes in specific subgroups of patients. Many approaches have been investigated in the attempt to improve engraftment and survival. Variable factors have been identified, such as factors related to donor choice (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility, cell dose, and others) and transplantation (conditioning and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimen). Data support that CB should be considered a reasonable option in those that do not have HLA matched sibling donor and for those in whom the time to transplant is critical. CONCLUSIONS: CB is a reasonable alternative to unrelated donor bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells for transplantation. Recently developed strategies aimed at improving hematopoietic recovery and reducing early transplantation-related mortality could further improve treatment outcomes of CBT for patients with acute leukemia.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no curative therapy for this disease; however, several new agents have shown very promising results. Autophagy has not been studied in CLL and in this study we first sought to determine if autophagy was functional in CLL with classic inducers, and if this contributes to direct cytotoxicity or protection from cell death. While autophagy is activated with all classic stimuli of this process, only unfolded protein endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy protects from cell death. Interestingly, select therapeutic agents (fludarabine, GS-1101, flavopiridol), which are active in CLL, also induce autophagy. Of interest, only the broad cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has improved efficacy when autophagy is antagonized biochemically (chloroquine) or by siRNA. This promoted an investigation which demonstrated unexpectedly that flavopiridol mediates ER stress and downstream activation of MAP3K5/ASK1, which ultimately is responsible for cell death. Similarly, autophagy activated in part via ER stress and also CDK5 inhibition is protective against cell death induced by this process. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that in CLL, autophagy is induced by multiple stimuli but only acts as a mechanism of resistance against ER stress-mediating agents. Similarly, flavopiridol mediates ER stress as a primary mechanism of action in CLL, and autophagy serves as a mechanism of resistance to this agent.",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'autophagy', 'chloroquine', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors', 'drug resistance', 'flavopiridol']","['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3590270,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Apr 3.,"Clofarabine (CAFdA) is incorporated into leukemic cells by human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENT) 1 and 2 and human concentrative nucleoside transporter (hCNT) 3. CAFdA is then phosphorylated to the active metabolite CAFdA triphosphate (CAFdATP) by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK). Two novel CAFdA-resistant variants were established and their mechanism of resistance was elucidated. The two variants (HL/CAFdA20, HL/CAFdA80) were 20-fold and 80-fold more CAFdA-resistant than HL-60, respectively. mRNA levels of hENT1, hENT2 and hCNT3 were 53.9, 41.8 and 17.7% in HL/CAFdA20, and 30.8, 13.9 and 7.9% in HL/CAFdA80, respectively, compared with HL-60. Thus, the total nucleoside transport capacity of CAFdA was reduced in both variants. dCK protein levels were 1/2 in HL/CAFdA20 and 1/8 in HL/CAFdA80 of that of HL-60. dGK protein levels were 1/2 and 1/3, respectively. CAFdATP production after 4-h incubation with 10 muM CAFdA was 20 pmol/10(7) cells in HL/CAFdA20 and 3 pmol/10(7) cells in HL/CAFdA80 compared with 63 pmol/10(7) cells in HL-60. The decreased CAFdATP production attenuated drug incorporation into both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. In addition, the two variants were resistant to CAFdA-induced apoptosis due to Bcl2 overexpression and decreased Bim. A Bcl2 inhibitor, ABT737, acted synergistically with CAFdA to inhibit the growth with combination index values of 0.27 in HL/CAFdA20 and 0.23 in HL/CAFdA80, compared with 0.65 in HL-60. Thus, the mechanism of resistance primarily included not only reduced CAFdATP production, but also increased antiapoptosis. The combination of CAFdA and ABT737 may be effective against CAFdA resistance.",['(c) 2013 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Japan.']",,,,,,,,PMC7657150,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, loss of pre-BCR-signaling components is associated with leukemia in both mice and humans. Exactly how progenitor B cells perform the task of balancing proliferative burst dependent on IL-7 with the termination of IL-7 signals and the initiation of L chain gene rearrangement remains to be elucidated. In this article, we provide genetic and functional evidence that the cessation of the IL-7 response of pre-B cells is controlled via a cell-autonomous mechanism that operates at a discrete developmental transition inside Fraction C' (large pre-BII) marked by transient expression of c-Myc. Our data indicate that pre-BCR cooperates with IL-7R in expanding the pre-B cell pool, but it is also critical to control the differentiation program shutting off the c-Myc gene in large pre-B cells.",,"['Division of Immunobiology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",,,,,,,"['DK043351/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AI047829/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI073718/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK083756/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK078318/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI061077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI073718/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK083756/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047829/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK043351/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI061077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3649847,['NIHMS437704'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Following modification of the treatment protocols, severe symptomatic late effects are rare, and most adverse effects are detected by sensitive imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or by neuropsychological testing. In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of late central nervous system (CNS) damage by MRI and clinical examination in children treated for ALL. A cross-sectional study was carried out at the pediatric oncology unit of Zagazig University, Egypt, and included 25 patients who were consecutively enrolled and treated according to the modified Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1991 protocol for standard risk ALL and the modified CCG 1961 protocol for high-risk ALL and who had survived more than 5 years from the diagnosis. All relevant data were collected from patients' medical records; particularly the data concerning the initial clinical presentation and initial brain imaging. All patients were subjected to thorough history and full physical examination with special emphasis on the neurological system. MRI of the brain was performed for all patients. The mean age of patients was 6.9+/-3.04 years at diagnosis and was 12.9+/-3.2 years at the time of study. The patients comprised 14 boys and 11 girls. Abnormal MRI findings were detected in six patients (24%). They were in the form of leukoencephalopathy in two patients (8%), brain atrophy in two patients (8%), old infarct in one patient (4%) and old hemorrhage in one patient (4%). The number of abnormal MRI findings was significantly higher in high-risk patients, patients who had CNS manifestations at diagnosis and patients who had received cranial irradiation. We concluded that cranial irradiation is associated with higher incidence of MRI changes in children treated for ALL. Limitation of cranial irradiation to selected patients contributed to a lower incidence of neurological complications in our study. MRI is a sensitive radiological tool to detect structural changes in children treated for ALL, even in asymptomatic cases.",,"['Departments of Pediatrics, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'brain', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'survivors']",,PMC3573121,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To obtain a comprehensive picture of tumour cell survival in lethal prostate cancer metastases, we examined five survival proteins that operate within three survival pathways in a cohort of 185 lethal metastatic prostate metastases obtained from 44 patients. The expression levels of BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, cytoplasmic survivin, nuclear survivin, and stathmin were measured by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray. Simultaneous expression of three or more proteins occurred in 81% of lethal prostate cancer metastases and BCL-2, cytoplasmic survivin and MCL-1 were co-expressed in 71% of metastatic sites. An unsupervised cluster analysis separated bone and soft tissue metastases according to patterns of survival protein expression. BCL-2, cytoplasmic survivin and MCL-1 had significantly higher expression in bone metastases (p < 10(-5)), while nuclear survivin was significantly higher in soft tissue metastases (p = 3 x 10(-14)). BCL-XL overexpression in soft tissue metastases almost reached significance (p = 0.09), while stathmin expression did not (p = 0.28). In addition, the expression of MCL-1 was significantly higher in AR-positive tumours. Neuroendocrine differentiation was not associated with specific survival pathways. These studies show that bone and soft tissue metastases from the same patient differ significantly in expression of a panel of survival proteins and that with regard to survival protein expression, expression is associated with the metastatic site and not the patient. Altogether, this suggests that optimal therapeutic inhibition may require combinations of drugs that target both bone and soft tissue-specific survival pathways.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Epub 2013 Mar 27.,"Transient, potent BCR-ABL inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was recently demonstrated to be sufficient to commit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to apoptosis irreversibly. This mechanism explains the clinical efficacy of once-daily dasatinib treatment, despite the rapid clearance of the drug from the plasma. However, our in vitro data suggest that apoptosis induction after transient TKI treatment, observed in the BCR-ABL-positive cell lines K562, KYO-1, and LAMA-84 and progenitor cells from chronic phase CML patients, is instead caused by a residual kinase inhibition that persists in the cells as a consequence of intracellular drug retention. High intracellular concentrations of imatinib and dasatinib residues were measured in transiently treated cells. Furthermore, the apoptosis induced by residual imatinib or dasatinib from transient treatment could be rescued by washing out the intracellularly retained drugs. The residual kinase inhibition was also undetectable by the phospho-CRKL assay. These findings confirm that continuous target inhibition is required for the optimal efficacy of kinase inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['CBIA-Centre for Biomedical Image Analysis, Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. cbia.muni@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 19.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells. As in other cancers, MM plasma cells are thought to be derived from MM-initiating cells, although these remain unidentified. MM patients harbor phenotypic CD19(+) B cells expressing the immunoglobulin gene sequence and the idiotype unique to the individual myeloma clone. Some previous studies have reported that CD19(+) clonotypic B cells can serve as MM-initiating cells. However, we and another group have recently showed that CD19(+) B cells from many MM patients do not reconstitute MM disease upon transplantation into NOD/SCID IL2Rgammac(-/-) mice. In the SCID-rab and SCID-hu models, which enable engraftment of human MM in vivo, CD19(-)CD38(++) plasma cells engrafted and rapidly propagated MM, while engraftment of CD19(+) B cells was not detected. Both CD138(-) and CD138(+) plasma cells have the potential to propagate MM clones in vivo in the absence of CD19(+) B cells. Distinct from acute myeloid leukemia-initiating cells, which are derived from undifferentiated stem or progenitor cells, MM-initiating cells are derived from plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated cells. An improved understanding of how the bone marrow microenvironment supports MM-initiating plasma cells, which can initiate MM disease in the SCID-hu (or rab) model, is thus now essential.",,"['Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-7 Yamada-Oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan. hnaoki@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown the increased role of infection factors in pathogenesis of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). This prompted us to test whether there is a correlation between MyD88-TIRAP dynamics before and after inflammatory stimuli. We determined the mRNA and protein expression of TIRAP and MyD88 in CD5(+)CD19(+) B-CLL cells and in a subpopulation of normal B CD19(+) lymphocytes. Additionally we determined the influence of lipopolysaccharide Escherichia coli - TLR4-ligand (LPS) and Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I - TLR2-ligand (SAC) on TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein, also called MyD88 adaptor-like (TIRAP) and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) expression. We have found that the mRNA and protein expression of TIRAP and MyD88 in B-CLL lymphocytes is lower compared with that in normal B lymphocytes. LPS and SAC stimulation in normal lymphocytes significantly altered neither TIRAP nor MyD88 mRNA expression, whereas TIRAP protein level substantially decreased after TLR agonist treatment. We did not observe any changes in MyD88 protein level after B lymphocyte stimulation. There was a significant increase in TIRAP mRNA expression after LPS and SAC stimulation of B-CLL cells. MyD88 mRNA expression levels in B-CLL lymphocytes slightly decreased upon treatment with either stimulator. Stimulation with TLR agonists did not cause changes in TIRAP and MyD88 expression at the protein level in B-CLL lymphocytes. The results of our study suggest that there may exist a, yet unknown, defect of TIRAP and MyD88 proteins in B-CLL lymphocytes.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We reviewed the outcomes of relapsed AML post-HSCT at our institution to determine whether survival for patients with EM relapse was truly improved in comparison to patients suffering BM relapses treated in a similar (active) way. METHODS: Outcomes of all 274 allogeneic HSCT performed for adult AML between 2000 and 2010 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: As of January 2011, 72 relapses post-HSCT had occurred, including 64 BM relapses (89%), two concomitant BM and EM relapses (3%), and six EM relapses alone (8%). EM relapses occurred significantly later post-HSCT than BM relapses (median 25.2 vs 3.9 months, respectively; P = 0.001). Patients suffering an EM relapse were significantly more likely to receive active therapy at relapse (7/8; 88%) than those suffering a BM relapse alone (28/64; 44%; P = 0.026). When survival analysis was restricted to outcomes of patients treated actively (i.e., with curative intent), no difference in outcome between EM and BM relapses was observed (median survival 13.5 vs 8 months for EM vs BM relapses, respectively, P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that EM relapse post-HSCT has similar outcomes to BM relapses treated in a similar way. Furthermore, choice of therapy at relapse appears related to the time post-HSCT that the relapse occurs, with BM relapses occurring significantly earlier post-HSCT than relapses at EM sites.",['(c) 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],"[""Department of Haematology, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia.""]",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'extramedullary', 'relapse', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Apr 2.,"5-Bromotetrandrine (BrTet), a candidate multidrug resistance (MDR) modulator, is a potential compound for use in cancer therapy when combined with anticancer agents such as daunorubicin (DNR) and paclitaxel. The purposeof this study was to investigate the mechanism of reversal of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated MDR by BrTet and the involvement of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling pathway in both adriamycin-sensitive K562 and adriamycin-resistant K562 (KA) leukemia cells in hypoxia. The combination of BrTet and DNR decreased both phosphorylated JNK1/2 and MDR1/P-gp levels under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, a pharmacological inhibitor of JNK, SP600125, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides to both JNK1 and JNK2 reversed BrTet- or DNR-induced JNK phosphorylation and MDR1/P-gp levels. We further demonstrated that the decreased JNK phosphorylation and MDR1/P-gp levels were associated with a significant increase in intracellular accumulation of DNR, which dramatically enhanced the sensitivity of drug-resistant KA cells to DNR, and led to cellular apoptosis through activation of the caspase-3 pathway. It is concluded that using BrTet in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and pharmacological inhibitors of JNK can abrogate the P-gp-induced MDR in adriamycin-resistant K562 cells, which has potential clinical relevance in cancer therapy for chemotherapeutic-resistant human leukemia.",,"[""Medical School, Southeast University , Nanjing , People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 May;57(5):1244.

Whether SCF expression is a feature of other B cell malignancies and whether cross-talk from the local microenvironment modulates malignant cell SCF production are, however, unknown. Here we show using immunohistochemistry that SCF is expressed by a wide variety of indolent and aggressive B cell malignancies involving the bone marrow (BM) or lymph nodes (LNs). In diseases such as follicular lymphoma (FL), however, where lymphoma cells uniquely associate with the BM endosteal niche, BM lymphoma does not express SCF, while LN involvement is SCF positive. In contrast, cases of FL with high-grade transformation in the BM are SCF positive. These data suggest that lymphoma cell interaction with the endosteal niche inhibits SCF production, and that FL cells become independent of this microenvironment effect following transformation.",,"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.']",,,,,,,['1DP2OD002160-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also propose a MaxTest associating between a time-to-event trait and a SNP accounting for its possible genetic models. The proposed MaxTest can help screen out nonprognostic SNPs and identify genetic models of prognostic SNPs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations.

Rituximab is an anti-CD20 Ab that prolongs survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients when combined with chemotherapy. Ofatumumab and GA101 (obinutuzumab) are CD20-directed Abs currently being developed as alternative agents to rituximab in CLL based upon different properties of enhanced direct cell death, NK cell-mediated Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Despite widespread study, ofatumumab and GA101 have not been compared with each other, nor studied for their interactions with monocytes and macrophages which are critical for the efficacy of anti-CD20 Abs in murine models. In CLL cells, we show that direct cell death and complement-dependent cytotoxicity are greatest with GA101 and ofatumumab, respectively. GA101 promotes enhanced NK cell activation and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at high Ab concentrations. Ofatumumab elicits superior Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis with monocyte-derived macrophages. GA101 demonstrated reduced activation of monocytes with diminished pERK, TNF-alpha release, and FcgammaRIIa recruitment to lipid rafts.

Epub 2013 Feb 1.,"In this study, we attempt to target the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells using a recombinant anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx). LeTx consists of protective antigen (PrAg) and lethal factor (LF). PrAg binds cells, is cleaved by furin, oligomerizes, binds three to four molecules of LF, and undergoes endocytosis, releasing LF into the cytosol. LF cleaves MAPK kinases, inhibiting the MAPK pathway. We tested potency of LeTx on a panel of 11 human AML cell lines. Seven cell lines showed cytotoxic responses to LeTx. Cytotoxicity of LeTx was mimicked by the specific mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor U0126, indicating that LeTx-induced cell death is mediated through the MEK1/2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) branch of the MAPK pathway. The four LeTx-resistant cell lines were sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Co-treatment of AML cells with both LeTx and LY294002 did not lead to increased sensitivity, showing a lack of additive/synergistic effects when both pathways are inhibited. Flow cytometry analysis of MAPK pathway activation revealed the presence of phospho-ERK1/2 only in LeTx-sensitive cells. Staining for Annexin V/propidium iodide and active caspases showed an increase in double-positive cells and the absence of caspase activation following treatment, indicating that LeTx-induced cell death is caspase-independent and nonapoptotic. We have shown that a majority of AML cell lines are sensitive to the LF-mediated inhibition of the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that LeTx-induced cytotoxicity in AML cells is nonapoptotic and dependent on phospho-ERK1/2 levels.",,"['Department of Natural Sciences, School of Arts and Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon.']",,,,,,,,PMC3573651,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRNAs), important post-transcriptional regulators, in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is just emerging and has been mainly studied in adults. First studies in children investigate single selected miRNAs, however, a comprehensive overview of miRNA expression and function in children and young adults is missing so far. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We here globally identified differentially expressed miRNAs between AML subtypes in a survey of 102 children and adolescent. Pediatric samples with core-binding factor AML and promyelocytic leukemia could be distinguished from each other and from MLL-rearranged AML subtypes by differentially expressed miRNAs including miR-126, -146a, -181a/b, -100, and miR-125b. Subsequently, we established a newly devised immunoprecipitation assay followed by rapid microarray detection for the isolation of Argonaute proteins, the hallmark of miRNA targeting complexes, from cell line models resembling core-binding factor and promyelocytic leukemia. Applying this method, we were able to identify Ago-associated miRNAs and their targeted mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: miRNAs as well as their mRNA-targets showed binding preferences for the different Argonaute proteins in a cell context-dependent manner. Bioinformatically-derived pathway analysis suggested a concerted action of all four Argonaute complexes in the regulation of AML-relevant pathways. For the first time, to our knowledge, a complete AML data set resulting from carefully devised biochemical isolation experiments and analysis of Ago-associated miRNAs and their target-mRNAs is now available.",,"['Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Clinic for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",,,,,,,,PMC3572007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"Side population (SP) cells have been reported to have properties of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), yet their molecular features have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that, NSCLC-SP cells were enriched in G(0)/G-(1) phase of cell cycle, had higher aldehyde dehydrogenase activity as well as higher clonogenic and self-renewing ability compared to main population (MP) cells. Interestingly, SP cells were also able to trans-differentiate into angiogenic tubules in vitro and were highly tumorigenic as compared to MP cells. SP-derived tumors demonstrated the intratumoral heterogeneity comprising of both SP and MP cells, suggesting the self-renewal and differentiation ability of SP cells are manifested in vivo as well. betaArrestin-1 (betaArr1) is involved in the progression of various cancers including NSCLCs and we find that depletion of betaArr1 significantly blocked the SP phenotype; whereas depletion of betaArr2 had relatively minor effects. Ectopic expression of betaArr1 resulted in increased SP frequency and ABCG2 expression while abrogation of betaArr1 expression suppressed the self-renewal growth and expansion of A549 cells. Anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 is known to be one of the key regulators of self-renewal of tissue stem cells and is thought to contribute to survival of NSCLC cells. Our experiments show that higher levels of Mcl-1 were expressed in SP cells compared to MP cells at both transcriptional and translational levels. In addition, Obatoclax, a pharmacological inhibitor of Mcl-1, could effectively prevent the self-renewal of both EGFR-inhibitor sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that betaArr1 and Mcl-1 are involved in the self-renewal and expansion of NSCLC-CSCs and are potential targets for anti-cancer therapy.",,"['Department of Tumor Biology, H.

Epub 2013 Feb 14.,"Next-generation sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools for the understanding of cancer genomes. In recent years, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing strategies have enabled the annotation of a comprehensive mutation landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent leukemia in western countries. Several recurrently mutated genes have been identified, with a subset being validated as neoplastic drivers. Still, a main challenge remains for the differentiation between driver and passenger mutations among candidates as well as for the functional description of the newly discovered leukemogenic genes that could be utilized for personalized anti-tumor strategies. In this scenario, we have identified the metabolic enzyme sucrase-isomaltase (SI) as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a cohort of 105 CLL patients. Here, we demonstrate that these SI mutations result in loss of enzyme function by preventing the biosynthesis of catalytically competent SI at the cell surface. Transcriptome analyses of RNA from CLL patients with SI loss-of-function mutations have uncovered gene expression patterns that depict ample metabolic reprogramming, pinpointing SI as a putative player in the cancer-associated metabolic switch. These results highlight SI as a relevant target for clinical evaluation in future CLL studies.",,"['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 15.,"BACKGROUND: Adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at increased cardiovascular risk. Studies of factors including treatment exposures that may modify risk of low cardiorespiratory fitness in this population have been limited. PROCEDURE: To assess cardiorespiratory fitness, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) was measured in 115 ALL survivors (median age, 23.5 years; range 18-37). We compared VO2 max measurements for ALL survivors to those estimated from submaximal testing in a frequency-matched (age, gender, race/ethnicity) 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort. Multivariable linear regression models were constructed to evaluate the association between therapeutic exposures and outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Compared to NHANES participants, ALL survivors had a substantially lower VO2 max (mean 30.7 vs. 39.9 ml/kg/min; adjusted P < 0.0001). For any given percent total body fat, ALL survivors had an 8.9 ml/kg/min lower VO2 max than NHANES participants. For key treatment exposure groups (cranial radiotherapy [CRT], anthracycline chemotherapy, or neither), ALL survivors had substantially lower VO2 max compared with NHANES participants (all comparisons, P < 0.001). Almost two-thirds (66.7%) of ALL survivors were classified as low cardiorespiratory fitness compared with 26.3% of NHANES participants (adjusted P < 0.0001). In multivariable models including only ALL survivors, treatment exposures were modestly associated with VO2 max. Among females, CRT was associated with low VO2 max (P = 0.02), but anthracycline exposure was not (P = 0.58). In contrast, among males, anthracycline exposure >/= 100 mg/m(2) was associated with low VO2 max (P = 0.03), but CRT was not (P = 0.54). CONCLUSION: Adult survivors of childhood ALL have substantially lower levels of cardiorespiratory fitness compared with a similarly aged non-cancer population.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",,,,,,,"['K05 CA160724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR000633/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K05-CA-160724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR-00633/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024982/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CTSA UL1-RR-024982/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3725590,['NIHMS479399'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Aug 26.,"The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation between bcr and abl genes plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific DNA probes provides a useful and accurate way for the detection of bcr/abl fusion gene in single cell. Here, we report an unusual case of a patient with no prior hematologic disease who initially manifested lymphadenopathy. The lymph node findings were suspicious for T-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma, however, his blood and bone marrow at that time were in chronic phase of CML. This presented difficulty for accurate discrimination between CML blast crisis (BC) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). To discern where the extramedullary nodal malignancy originated from, we cytologically analyzed lymph node biopsies and bone marrow with FISH to detect bcr/abl fusion signals. Together with the morphology, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics as well as molecular analysis, the patient was diagnosed as extramedullary T-lymphoid BC of Ph+ CML. In conclusion, this case is unusual at three levels: first, extramedullary nodal BC as a presenting manifestation of CML is rare and the blasts are of precursor T lymphoblastic lineage, rather than the more common B-cell lineage; second, this case suggests that extramedullary lymphoid nodal BC of CML can exist independently without the bone marrow developing into BC; and third, FISH analysis on the single neoplastic cell is an accurate way to confirm that the neoplasm is either extramedullary localized blasts of CML or genetically distinct neoplasm.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","[""Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iron chelation has been reported in retrospective studies to improve overall survival in low-risk MDS patients, but this information needs to be validated in prospective trials. The oral iron chelator, deferasirox, has been shown to reduce serum ferritin levels in chelation naive and pre-treated patients and to reduce labile plasma iron, independently from the efficacy on iron overload. Deferasirox is a potent NF-kB inhibitor, tested in vivo and on acute myeloid leukemia and MDS cell lines, and this effect may explain in part the phenomenon of hematological improvements reported in case reports and in different clinical trials. The drug has an acceptable safety profile, with the most common side effects reported being non-progressive change in serum creatinine level, gastrointestinal disturbances, and skin rash. In this review, we report the results of different studies testing safety and efficacy of deferasirox in MDS patients, side effects associated with the drug, and suggested management of iron overload.",,"['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy, breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to find out whether there is any difference in cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) of CLL between the West and the East. We analyze the CA, by conventional cytogenetics (CG) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and their clinical significance in 83 Taiwanese CLL patients and compared the data to those of Western countries. Thirty-five patients (42.2 %) possessed CG-CA and 58 (69.9 %) FISH-CA. By either CG or FISH, deletion of 17p or 11q was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (P<0.001 and P=0.008, respectively), whereas isolated 13q deletion was associated with better OS (P=0.050). Trisomy 3 by CG was found in five patients; all of them were in Binet A stage but had strikingly poor OS (P<0.001). This prognostic impact was independent from the other CA and Binet stages. We conclude that, though the disease incidence is much different, the CA of CLL in Taiwan are similar to those in the West. The combined CG and FISH analysis is able to predict the patients' prognosis. The clinical significance of trisomy 3 warrants further validation.",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, 100, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal analysis of data from an ovarian tissue bank in an academic hospital. Five hundred and eighty-two patients had their ovarian tissue cryobanked between April 1997 and January 2012. Analysis of cryobanking database: precryopreservation patient characteristics, indications and safety issues, laboratory files and postcryopreservation clinical data. RESULTS: Of the 582 patients who had their ovarian tissue cryopreserved, 106 patients donated for research purposes and 476 patients for fertility preservation and long-term cryopreservation. Clinical data analysis of the 476 patients revealed a mean age at the time of cryopreservation of 23 +/- 8.5 years (range: 9 months - 39 years), with 96.2 % of subjects aged </=35 years (n = 458). Among 391 cases of malignant disease, hematological malignancies (39.9 %, n = 156) and breast cancer (21.7 %, n = 85) were the two main indications. At histology, malignant cells were found in ovarian tissue from leukemia patients (n = 3) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (n = 2). Eleven patients underwent autotransplantation, resulting in 5 live births and 1 ongoing pregnancy. CONCLUSION: This is the largest and most comprehensive study to describe and analyze indications and clinical patient characteristics before and after ovarian tissue cryopreservation. The procedure is safe, easy and promising. The database concept is a useful tool in patient selection for autotransplantation.",,"['Department of Gynecology, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier 52, Brussels, Belgium. marie-madeleine.dolmans@uclouvain.be']",,,,,,,,PMC3607674,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tick-borne disease titers (genera Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Borrelia) were negative, as were polymerase chain reaction for other infectious agents (genera Hepatozoon, Mycobacterium, Mycoplasma; and Canine distemper virus). No agents were identified in a deep dermal biopsy (conventional and special histochemical stains) of the chronic draining, metacarpal region lesion. Cytology of the draining tract revealed numerous mixed bacteria and a surprising lack of neutrophils. Chronic occult blood loss with iron deficiency was considered a possible cause of the anemia. Differentials for the leukon were chronic established inflammation (occult infectious agent), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, paraneoplastic leukocytosis (neoplastic source of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [CSF] or granulocyte-macrophage CSF), and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). The possibility of a LAD disorder was further investigated because of the noted hypersegmented neutrophils, absence of neutrophils in the cytology sample, the animal's young age, and persistence of clinical and laboratory signs. Flow cytometry of blood neutrophils showed a 60% reduction in surface expression of the beta2-integrin (CD18) subunit, whereas neutrophil function tests (oxidative burst and phagocytosis) were normal. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the beta2-integrin subunit gene, previously recognized only in purebred Irish Setters, leading to a diagnosis of LAD type 1 disorder in this mixed-breed dog.",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA. kzimmerm@vt.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with long-term HRQOL outcomes of CML patients receiving imatinib. Analysis was performed on 422 CML patients recruited in an observational multicenter study. HRQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Key socio-demographic and clinical data were investigated for their association with HRQOL outcomes. Chronic fatigue and social support were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with HRQOL outcomes. Fatigue was the only variable showing an independent and consistent association across all physical and mental HRQOL outcomes (P<0.01). Differences between patients reporting low versus high fatigue levels were more than eight and seven times the magnitude of a clinically meaningful difference, respectively, for the role physical (Delta=70 points) and emotional scale (Delta=63 points) of the SF-36. Fatigue did not occur as an isolated symptom and was most highly correlated with musculoskeletal pain (r=0.511; P</=0.001) and muscular cramps (r=0.448; P</=0.001).

Previous studies have identified activin A to be of critical importance in MM-induced osteolysis. Lenalidomide is a known and approved treatment strategy for relapsed MM. Our findings demonstrate that lenalidomide acts directly on bone marrow stromal cells via an Akt-mediated increase in Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent signaling resulting in activin A secretion, with consequent inhibition of osteoblastogenesis. Here, we attempted to augment the antitumor benefits of lenalidomide while overcoming its effects on osteoblastogenesis by combining it with a neutralizing antibody to activin A. Increased activin A secretion induced by lenalidomide was abrogated by the addition of activin A-neutralizing antibody, which effectively restored osteoblast function and inhibited MM-induced osteolysis without negating the cytotoxic effects of lenalidomide on malignant cells. This provides the rationale for an ongoing clinical trial (NCT01562405) combining lenalidomide with an anti-activin A strategy.",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01562405'],,,,,,,,

This mutation occurs in most patients with mastocytosis, a myeloproliferative neoplasm, and is detected at lower frequencies in acute myeloid leukemia and in germ cell tumors. Other KIT mutations occur in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and mucosal melanoma. KIT is considered as a bona fide therapeutic target as c-kit mutations are driving oncogenes in these pathologies. However, several evidences suggest that KIT-D816V mutant is not as aggressive as other KIT mutants. Here, we show that an intracellular docking site in the juxtamembrane region of KIT maintains a negative regulation on KIT-D816V transforming potential. Sixteen signaling proteins were shown to interact with this motif. We further demonstrate that mutation of this site results in signaling modifications, altered gene expression profile and increased transforming activity of KIT-D816V mutant. This result was unexpected as mutations of the homologous sites on wild-type (WT) KIT, or on the related oncogenic FLT3-ITD receptor, impair their function. Our results support the hypothesis that, KIT-D816V mutation is a mild oncogenic event that is sufficient to confer partial transforming properties, but requires additional mutations to acquire its full transforming potential.",,"['1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', '1] INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 14.,"A preparative regimen of reduced intensity that can reliably engraft cord blood (CB) and can be used as an alternative to either high-dose myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning is needed. We evaluated double-unit CB transplantation in 30 patients (median age, 56 years; range, 18 to 69) with acute leukemia or myelodysplasia using a regimen of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, fludarabine 150 mg/m(2), thiotepa 10 mg/kg, and 400 cGy total body irradiation with cyclosporine-A/mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression. Ninety-seven percent of patients engrafted at a median of 26 days (range, 13 to 43), and 93% of patients had recovered platelets by day 180. Grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was 67% at day 180, and chronic GVHD was 10% at 1 year. Transplant-related mortality was 20% at day 180, and relapse was 11% at 2 years. Overall, 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 60% at 2 years. A hierarchy in DFS was seen according to the Sorror comorbidity score: 11 patients (median age, 55 years) with a score of 1 had a 2-year DFS of 82% compared with 62% in 9 patients (median age, 51 years) with a score of 2 to 3 and 40% in 11 patients (median age, 58 years) with a score of 4 to 5 (P = .13). This reduced-intensity regimen combined with double-unit CB transplantation reliably facilitates sustained donor engraftment without antithymocyte globulin. Although other approaches are needed in patients with high comorbidity scores, this regimen is highly effective in patients >/=50 years old who are otherwise reasonably fit.

Epub 2013 Feb 15.,"UNLABELLED: Oridonin, an ent-kaurane diterpene isolated from well known Chinese medicinal plant Isodon rubescens, has been shown to have multiple biological activities. Among them, the anticancer activity has been repeatedly reported by many research groups. The chemopreventive and antitumor effects of oridonin have been related to its ability to interfere with several pathways which are involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and/or autophagy. Despite the number of studies performed on this diterpene, the molecular mechanism underlying its cellular activity remains to be elucidated. Hence, we tried to mine target protein(s) of oridonin by employing a mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approach, providing evidences that oridonin is able to directly bind the multifunctional, stress-inducible heat shock protein 70 1A (HSP70 1A). Oridonin/HSP70 complex formation was confirmed in leukemia-derived Jurkat cells. The characterization of HSP70 inhibition by oridonin was performed using chemical and biological approaches. Moreover, the binding site of oridonin on the chaperone was identified by a mass-based approach combined with Molecular Dynamics simulations. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although natural products showed high efficiency and several of these agents have now entered in clinical trials, information concerning the mechanisms of action at a molecular level of many of them is very poor or completely missed. Nevertheless, the identification of the molecular target of a drug candidate has several advantages. The most significant is the ability to set up target-based assays and to allow structure-activity relationship studies to guide medicinal chemistry efforts towards lead optimization. The knowledge of drug targets can also facilitate the identification of potential toxicities or side effects, if there is any precedent of toxicities for the identified target. Achieving this in an effective, unbiased and efficient manner subsists as a significant challenge for the new era in drug discovery and optimization. In the present study, we used a chemical proteomic approach aimed to define the possible protein target of the ent-kaurane diterpene oridonin. This natural compound has drawn a rising attention for cancer biologists due to its remarkable anti-tumor activities: accumulating evidence has suggested that oridonin is able to hamper the progression of tumor, mitigate tumor burden and alleviate cancer syndrome, which may improve greatly the survival rates of cancer patients; however molecular mechanisms by which this compound exerts its anti-tumor activities still remained to be discovered. We identified the molecular chaperone HSP70 1A as an oridonin target in Jurkat cells, thus suggesting a mechanism of action for the diterpene consistent with the multiple biological activities described for it. HSP70 inhibition by oridonin might indeed simultaneously result in the impairment of some of client proteins, thus in turn affecting several molecular pathways. Shedding light on the molecular basis of the biological activity of oridonin, our findings may be relevant for possible therapeutic applications of oridonin, such as its use in combination and the design of new therapeutic approaches. In addition, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of chemical proteomic approaches in drug discovery studies and in orphan drug molecular target identification.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we utilize the copper-chelator drug ATN-224 (choline tetrathiomolybdate) to induce cell death in oxidative stress-resistant cells and cells overexpressing Bcl-2 by modulating the cellular redox environment and causing mitochondrial dysfunction. ATN-224 treatment decreases superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity, increases intracellular oxidants, and induces peroxynitrite-dependent cell death. ATN-224 also targets the mitochondria, decreasing both cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX) activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. The concentration of ATN-224 required to induce cell death is proportional to SOD1 levels, but independent of Bcl-2 status. In combination with doxorubicin, ATN-224 enhances cell death. In primary B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples, ATN-224 decreases the viable cell number. Our findings suggest that ATN-224's dual targeting of SOD1 and CcOX is a promising approach for treatment of hematological malignancies either as an adjuvant or as a single agent.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"Sustained NF-kappaB activation is often observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); therefore, proteasome inhibition has been proposed to efficiently target AML cells. In this study, we questioned whether leukemic stem cell-enriched CD34(+) cells are sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Surprisingly, we observed in short-term and long-term culture assays that CD34(-) AML cells were more sensitive to bortezomib treatment compared with the CD34(+) AML cells at a clinical relevant dosage. Cotreatment with the apoptosis-inducing cytokine TRAIL did not enhance cell death in CD34(+) AML cells, in contrast to the effects in AML cell lines. The better survival of CD34(+) AML cells upon bortezomib treatment was due to a persisting NF-kappaB activity that could be overcome by the IKK inhibitor BMS-345541. This difference in sensitivity might be related to differences in NF-kappaB activation in AML CD34(+) versus CD34(-) cells, as suggested by a gene expression profiling study. Besides NF-kappaB, MCL-1 strongly determines the effectiveness of bortezomib. MCL-1 accumulated in CD34(+) AML cells upon bortezomib treatment and inhibition of MCL-1 by shRNA, or Obatoclax, significantly improved the sensitivity of CD34(+) AML cells to bortezomib. These results demonstrate that combining bortezomib with specific NF-kappaB or MCL-1 inhibitors might potentially target the leukemic stem cells.","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The molecular and immunophenotypic changes of pPCL are often distinct from those seen in secondary PCL and multiple myeloma. The availability of novel agents (ie, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents) and the increasing use of hematopoietic cell transplantation strategies have resulted in better outcomes, although long-term survival remains poor. Development of complex treatment algorithms that combine novel agents as induction therapy, as part of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation (autologous or allogeneic), or as post-transplantation remission strategies are logical and may translate into improved survival in patients with PCL.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Whereas the CD21/CD19 complex is widely retained on immortalized and B cell tumor lines, the related complement-regulatory protein CD35 is lost. To determine the role(s) of CD35 in initial infection, we transduced a CD21-negative pre-B cell and myeloid leukemia line with CD35, CD21, or both. Cells expressing CD35 alone bound gp350/220 and became latently infected when the fusion receptor HLA II was coexpressed. Temporal, biophysical, and structural characteristics of CD35-mediated infection were distinct from CD21. Identification of CD35 as an EBV receptor uncovers a salient role in primary infection, addresses unsettled questions of virus tropism, and underscores the importance of EBVgp350/220 for vaccine development.",['Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors.

Epub 2013 Feb 14.,"Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger is a zinc finger transcription factor that functions as a transcriptional repressor. Its expression has been shown to be down-regulated in hematopoietic, melanocytic, and mesothelial malignancies. Histone H1.5 is a variant of histone H1, a family of linker proteins that organizes chromosomes into higher order structures. Its function is of key importance in gene expression and has been linked to more aggressive forms of prostatic carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical detectability of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and histone H1.5 in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, comprising 11 carcinoid tumorlets, 24 typical carcinoids, 12 atypical carcinoids, 20 small cell carcinomas, 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 2 combined small cell carcinomas-large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong nuclear staining in all carcinoid tumorlets, 23 of 24 typical carcinoids, and 7 of 12 atypical carcinoids in contrast to 9 of 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, all small cell carcinoma, and both combined small cell carcinoma-large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, which showed no nuclear immunoreactivity. Histone H1.5 immunohistochemistry revealed only focal or no immunoreactivity in all carcinoid tumorlets and 19 of 24 typical carcinoids, whereas 7 of 12 atypical carcinoids, 19 of 20 small cell carcinomas, 10 of 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and both combined small cell carcinomas-large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas displayed positive (>/= 10%) nuclear immunoreactivity-ranging from a minority of weak staining to a majority of strong staining cases. Our data suggest that the relative expression ratios of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and histone H1.5 may correlate with grade of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. Immunohistochemical stains for these markers, especially on small biopsies with crush artifact, may prove to be diagnostically useful.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHOD: We present here a case of a 21-year-old man who underwent radical removal of a radio-induced parasagittal meningioma totally invading the posterior third of the sinus. For its reconstruction, we used the patient's left superficial femoral vein without valves as an autograft, by realizing two end-to-end anastomoses between the sinus and the graft after an en-bloc removal of the meningioma and the invaded sinus. RESULTS: Two years after surgery, clinical examination of the patient was strictly normal and the femoral venous graft was still patent on CT angiograms. CONCLUSION: The superficial femoral vein without valves seems to be convenient for SSS reconstruction.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here we examine the regulation of cell death by hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), which is an output regulator of circadian rhythms and is aberrantly expressed in human cancers, using an ectopic expression strategy in JB6 mouse epidermal cells and human keratinocytes. Ectopic HLF expression inhibited cell death in both JB6 cells and human keratinocytes, as induced by serum-starvation, tumor necrosis factor alpha and ionizing radiation. Microarray analysis indicates that HLF regulates a complex multi-gene transcriptional program encompassing upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, and many additional changes that are consistent with an anti-death program. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of HLF, an established transcription factor that cycles with circadian rhythms, can recapitulate many features associated with circadian-dependent physiological variation.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"Numerous studies have shown the antiproliferative effect of iron chelating agents (ICAs), which have been used traditionally in patients with secondary iron overload (SIO). Because the in vivo model for these studies has been animals with normal iron status, the antileukemic effect of ICAs in the SIO condition has not been determined clearly. We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of ICAs in murine leukemic cell lines regarding the iron status. The viability of both EL4 cells and L1210 cells incubated with either deferoxamine (DFO) or deferasirox (DFX) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was most prominent in L1210 cells treated with DFX. The viability of L1210 cells incubated with both ICAs did not change regardless of the presence of ferric chloride. The percentage of apoptosis in L1210 cells treated with DFO or DFX increased in a concentration-dependent manner; however, the expression of Fas showed no significant change. The non-SIO mice and SIO mice bearing L1210 cells showed longer survival than other groups when treated with DFX, whereas the SIO mice treated with DFO showed shorter survival than the control group. The tumor was significantly smaller in the SIO mice treated with DFX or DFO compared with the control group. The iron content of the liver or the tumor in SIO mice decreased after ICA treatment. This study indicates an antileukemic effect of DFX regardless of iron status and suggests that the use of DFX has a survival benefit for SIO leukemia murine model in terms of iron chelation and antileukemic therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

They are an extremely diverse group of clinical aberrations that are associated with the noninvasive actions of the tumor. In many situations, the PNS parallels the underlying malignancy, and therefore, successful treatment of the tumor leads to disappearance of the PNS. Alternatively, recurrence of the PNS after successful treatment signals recurrence of the tumor, and the return of the PNS often significantly precedes the detectable recurrence of the tumor. This is often the case with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, often referred to as hypercalcemia of malignancy (HM). The most common cause of hypercalcemia in dogs is cancer. Neoplasia is diagnosed in approximately two-thirds of dogs with hypercalcemia vs. approximately one-third in cats. A variety of tumors have been associated with HM. Lymphoma is the most common cause of HM, and the most common anatomical site for dogs with lymphoma-associated HM is the cranial mediastinum. Other tumors associated with HM in dogs and cats include anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, multiple myeloma, bone tumors, thymoma, squamous cell carcinoma, mammary gland carcinoma/adenocarcinoma, melanoma, primary lung tumors, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, renal angiomyxoma, and parathyroid gland tumors.

Significant disease components include primary myelofibrosis, leukemia, histiocytic sarcoma, and vasculitis. Xist-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) show aberrant maturation and age-dependent loss. Reconstitution experiments indicate that MPN/MDS and myelofibrosis are of hematopoietic rather than stromal origin.

Therefore, simultaneous targeting of two or even more deregulated signal transduction pathways is needed to overcome drug resistance. Previously, it was reported that SNS-032, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is an effective agent for treatment of AML; however, the molecular mechanisms of SNS-032-induced cell death of AML cells are not yet fully understood. The aim of the study was to characterize the effects in vitro of SNS-032, used alone and in combination with an Akt inhibitor perifosine, against AML cells and to identify the mechanism involved. RESULTS: SNS-032 significantly induced cytotoxicity in human AML cell lines and blasts from patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AML. However, Kasumi-1 cells and some of leukemic samples (14.9%) from AML patients were resistant to SNS-032-mediated cell death. Western blot analysis showed that SNS-032 strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) on Ser 2448 and Ser2481, and that removal of SNS-032 resulted in partial recovery of cell death and reactivation of phosphorylation of mTOR. Moreover, exogenous insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) did not reverse SNS-032-induced cell growth inhibition and downregualtion of phosphor-mTOR at Ser2448 and Ser2481 although slight suppression of IGF-1R expression was triggered by the agent. Furthermore, SNS-032 at a lower concentration (60-80 nM) enhanced AML cell cytotoxicity induced by perifosine, an Akt inhibitor. Importantly, SNS-032 treatment reduced colony formation ability of AML cells, which was significantly increased when two agents were combined. This combination therapy led to almost complete inhibition of Akt activity. CONCLUSION: We conclude that SNS-032 might directly target mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/mTORC2. Our results further provide a rationale for combining SNS-032 with perifosine for the treatment of AML.",,"['Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, PR China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3599109,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records of NHL patients treated at a single institution between April 2004 and September 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Low-dose involved-field radiation therapy was given as 4 Gy in 2 fractions over 2 consecutive days. Treatment response and disease control were determined by radiographic studies and/or physical examination. A generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the effect of tumor and patient characteristics on disease response. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess time to further treatment. RESULTS: We treated a total of 187 sites in 127 patients with LD-IFRT. Histologies included 66% follicular, 9% chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 10% marginal zone, 6% mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and 8% other. Median follow-up time was 23.4 months (range, 0.03-92.2 months). The complete response, partial response, and overall response rates were 57%, 25%, and 82%, respectively. A CLL histology was associated with a lower response rate (odds ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.5, P=.02). Tumor size, site, age at diagnosis, and prior systemic therapy were not associated with response. The median time to first recurrence was 13.6 months. Those with CLL and age </= 50 years at diagnosis had a shorter time to further treatment for local failures (hazard ratio [HR] 3.63, P=.01 and HR 5.50, P=.02, respectively). Those with CLL and MCL had a shorter time to further treatment for distant failures (HR 11.1 and 16.3, respectively, P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: High local response rates were achieved with LD-IFRT across most histologies.

For AML CR1 with intermediate cytogenetics, however, the benefit of 8/8-matched URD should be compared with non-allogeneic therapies as well as MSD. METHODS: To address this issue, we assessed the transplantation outcomes of 8/8-matched URD (n = 54) compared with MSD (n = 145) or autologous transplantation (n = 89) for AML CR1 with intermediate cytogenetics. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, 8/8-matched URD had comparable 6-yr overall survival (OS, P = 0.997), disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.951), and relapse (P = 0.672) to MSD, whereas 8/8-matched URD had a higher OS (P = 0.070) and DFS (P = 0.035) with lower relapse (P = 0.009) than autologous transplantation. No difference in non-relapse mortality was observed according to donor type. Notably, these equivalent or superior outcomes of 8/8-matched URD compared with MSD or autologous transplantation, respectively, were particularly evident in patients without poor-risk features (n = 200), such as older age, hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis, and myelodysplasia-related changes, who are not usual candidates for URD transplantation.

The presence of central venous catheters (CVCs) increases this risk; however, reports have varied regarding the frequency of this complication. Current guidelines do not recommend the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with CVC. METHODS: We suspected an increased incidence of CVC thrombosis in patients with APL and therefore conducted a retrospective survey of 473 patients who were treated for acute leukemia at our institution. RESULTS: The overall rate of symptomatic CVC thrombosis was 6.8%. We found a significantly (P < 0.001) increased rate of symptomatic CVC thrombosis (32%) in patients with APL as compared with patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (6.4% and 4%, respectively). CVC thrombosis was most prevalent following induction treatment and was associated with higher platelet counts in patients with APL. Following this observation, 13 additional newly diagnosed patients with APL were treated with low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis during the recovery phase after chemotherapy. None had a thrombotic event.

In order to evaluate the sensitivity of normal immunocompetent cells implicated in the antitumor immune response, the cytotoxicity of extracts was also tested against healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). METHODS: The aerial parts of the plants were air-dried, powdered, and successively extracted with solvents of increasing polarity to obtain hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl-acetate, n-butanol and methanol extracts. The cytotoxic activities of the extracts against human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa, human melanoma Fem-x, human myelogenous leukemia K562, human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-361 cells and PBMC were evaluated by the MTT test. The mode of HeLa cell death was investigated by morphological analysis. Changes in the cell cycle of HeLa cells treated with the extracts were analyzed by flow cytometry. The apoptotic mechanisms induced by the tested extracts were determined using specific caspase inhibitors. RESULTS: The investigated Helichrysum zivojinii extracts exerted selective dose-dependent cytotoxic actions against selected cancer cell lines and healthy immunocompetent PBMC stimulated to proliferate, while the cytotoxic actions exerted on unstimulated PBMC were less pronounced. The tested extracts exhibited considerably stronger cytotoxic activities towards HeLa, Fem-x and K562 cells in comparison to resting and stimulated PBMC. It is worth noting that the cytotoxicity of the extracts was weaker against unstimulated PBMC in comparison to stimulated PBMC. Furthermore, each of the five extracts induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, through the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Extracts obtained from the endemic plant Helichrysum zivojinii may represent an important source of novel potential antitumor agents due to their pronounced and selective cytotoxic actions towards malignant cells.",,"['Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Pasterova 14, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia.']",,,,,,,,PMC3585823,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed heterogeneity at length and sequence level for the majority of mature miRNAs (IsomiRs). Most isomiRs can be explained by variability in either Dicer1 or Drosha cleavage during miRNA biogenesis at 5' or 3' of the miRNA (trimming variants). Although isomiRs have been described in different tissues and organisms, their functional validation as modulators of gene expression remains elusive. Here we have characterized the expression and function of a highly abundant miR-101 5'-trimming variant (5'-isomiR-101). RESULTS: The analysis of small RNA sequencing data in several human tissues and cell lines indicates that 5'-isomiR-101 is ubiquitously detected and a highly abundant, especially in the brain. 5'-isomiR-101 was found in Ago-2 immunocomplexes and complementary approaches showed that 5'-isomiR-101 interacted with different members of the silencing (RISC) complex. In addition, 5'-isomiR-101 decreased the expression of five validated miR-101 targets, suggesting that it is a functional variant. Both the binding to RISC members and the degree of silencing were less efficient for 5'-isomiR-101 compared with miR-101. For some targets, both miR-101 and 5'-isomiR-101 significantly decreased protein expression with no changes in the respective mRNA levels. Although a high number of overlapping predicted targets suggest similar targeted biological pathways, a correlation analysis of the expression profiles of miR-101 variants and predicted mRNA targets in human brains at different ages, suggest specific functions for miR-101- and 5'-isomiR-101. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that isomiRs are functional variants and further indicate that for a given miRNA, the different isomiRs may contribute to the overall effect as quantitative and qualitative fine-tuners of gene expression.",,"['Molecular and Cellular Neurobiotechnology Group, Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya, Parc Cientific de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,PMC3751341,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Sample consisted of 93 hematological malignancy patients recruited from oncology ward of Valieasr hospital for Imam Khomeini complex hospital at Tehran through purposeful sampling. Participants were divided into three groups through diagnostic interview based on DSM-IV-TR criteria and the Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-II): Major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 41; 44.1%); subsyndromal depression (SSD) (n = 23; 24.7%), and without depression (WD) (n = 29; 31.2%). Participants completed the short-form health survey (SF-36) as a measure of the quality of life. We carried out an analysis of covariance to examine the collected data. RESULTS: Findings showed that there was not a significant difference between patients with MDD and SSD based on measure of quality of life. But patients with MDD and SSD showed significantly worse quality of life than patients with WD. This finding highlights the clinical importance of subsyndromal depressive symptoms and casts doubt on the clinical utility of separation between MDD and subsyndromal depression in terms of important clinical outcomes.",,"['Department of Psychiatry, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran. dr.rezaei@uswr.ac.ir']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular studies by real-time PCR showed IL-6 gene expression in neoplastic basophils separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting infiltrating the bone marrow, suggesting that IL-6 is released by neoplastic basophils of an underlying CBL, resulting in a new paraneoplastic syndrome that mimics autoinflammatory disorders.",,"['Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Inciralti, Izmir, Turkey. cehrelicavit@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3-activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with AML and are associated with poor outcome in this patient population. Quizartinib (AC220) has previously been shown to be a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor. In the current study, we expand on previous observations by showing that quizartinib potently inhibits the phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream signaling molecules independent of FLT3 genotype, yet induces loss of viability only in cells expressing constitutively activated FLT3. We further show that transient exposure to quizartinib, whether in vitro or in vivo, leads to prolonged inhibition of FLT3 signaling, induction of apoptosis, and drastic reductions in tumor volume and pharmacodynamic endpoints. In vitro experiments suggest that these prolonged effects are mediated by slow binding kinetics that provide for durable inhibition of the kinase following drug removal/clearance. Together these data suggest quizartinib, with its unique combination of selectivity and potent/sustained inhibition of FLT3, may provide a safe and effective treatment against FLT3-driven leukemia.",,"['Ambit Biosciences, Corp, 11080 Roselle St., San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major challenges of using SNP arrays are accurately identifying acquired genomic DNA aberrations in the raw array data with very high sensitivity and specificity and meaningfully assessing the associations between these aberrations and biological characteristics or patient outcomes. Critical to the success and valid interpretation of data derived from SNP array profiling are (1) the purity of cells used as a source of template DNA; (2) the analysis of paired DNA samples (tumor and normal); (3) use of validated software tools for data analysis; (4) access to an acceptable gold standard for aCNA and LOH, including FISH data, cytogenetic results, and Q-PCR data; and (5) statistical support to employ or develop algorithmic approaches to SNP array data analysis.

Indeed, the BCR-ABL1 fusion product is a target against which many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been proven to be effective in the treatment of CML. However, the reality is that CML patients show resistance to TKIs both in an acquired and de novo manner, and the mechanism of TKI resistance is still largely unknown. This phenomenon suggests that in addition to the BCR-ABL mutation, further genetic alterations such as copy number aberration may be involved in unexplained TKI resistance. Although the recent array comparative genomic hybridization analyses (array-CGH) across the whole genome have detected multiple genetic aberrations in CML, the detailed feature of chromosomal alterations involved in different clinical phases of CML, such as chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis, remains unclear.

The influencing factors of hepatotoxicity were further analyzed. Liver impairment occurred in 24.4% of the patients, most of which was mild and moderate in severity. Liver impairment was primarily manifested by increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspertate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and these increases mostly occurred within 1 to 3 weeks and then returned to normal levels after 4 weeks. Patients' ages, sex, disease time, hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation did not show correlations with hepatotoxicity. Their hemogram and lactate dehydrogenase numerical values obtained from preliminary diagnosis did not show significant correlations with hepatotoxicity. Aggravated hepatotoxicity was not observed in patients receiving marcellomycin for the sake of complete remission. Changes in short-term cumulative dose of As2O3 did not exhibit a correlation with hepatotoxicity. However, patients suffering from differentiation syndrome were more likely at the risk of hepatotoxicity. Liver impairment improved after the suspension of As2O3 and liver protection treatment. No patient died of liver failure. Hepatotoxicity induced by As2O3 at a therapeutic dose for pediatric APL is mild and temporary. The first to the third week of the remission induction is the important period for monitoring.

No larger studies have yet performed a combined approach of molecular and clinical characterization of acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) and biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) in adults. Here we describe 16 adults with AUL and 26 with BAL and performed mutational as well as expression studies of genes with prognostic impact in acute leukemia (BAALC, ERG, MN1, WT1, and IGFBP7). AUL showed overexpression of these genes compared to T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), B-precursor ALL, and to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genotype alterations were not detectable in AUL. BAL samples were characterized by frequent WT1 mutations (18 %) and BCR-ABL translocations (30 %). ALL-based treatment protocols induced complete remissions in 40 % and AML-like therapies in 22 % of AUL/BAL patients. The outcome in both groups was very poor; a long-term survival was only observed in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Our findings indicate that AUL and BAL share important molecular and high-risk features of both myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. BAL patients exhibited genetic alterations, which can be targeted therapeutically. Importantly, ALL therapy might be more effective than AML protocols and AUL/BAL patients should be considered for allogeneic SCT.",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite University Hospital Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 14.,"Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusions are potent oncogenes that initiate aggressive forms of acute leukemia. As aberrant transcriptional regulators, MLL-fusion proteins alter gene expression in hematopoietic cells through interactions with the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L. Notably, interference with MLL-fusion cofactors like DOT1L is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this disease. Here, we identify the histone H2B E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) as an additional chromatin regulator that is necessary for MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis. Suppressing the expression of Rnf20 in diverse models of MLL-rearranged leukemia leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, under tissue culture conditions as well as in vivo. Rnf20 knockdown leads to reduced expression of MLL-fusion target genes, effects resembling Dot1l inhibition. Using ChIP-seq, we found that H2B ubiquitination is enriched in the body of MLL-fusion target genes, correlating with sites of H3K79 methylation and transcription elongation. Furthermore, Rnf20 is required to maintain local levels of H3K79 methylation by Dot1l at Hoxa9 and Meis1. These findings support a model whereby cotranscriptional recruitment of Rnf20 at MLL-fusion target genes leads to amplification of Dot1l-mediated H3K79 methylation, thereby rendering leukemia cells dependent on Rnf20 to maintain their oncogenic transcriptional program.",,"['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.']",,,,,,,"['P30 CA045508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3593849,,,,['Cell Cycle. 2013 May 15;12(10):1475-6.

Epub 2013 Feb 14.,"The optimal treatments for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remain equivocal. We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a sequential treatment consisting of induction and consolidation with arsenic trioxide (ATO), peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest after high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Between 2005 and 2009, 35 patients (26 with hematologic and 9 with molecular relapse) were enrolled. Induction therapy resulted in complete remission in 81% of those with hematologic relapse, and most patients became negative for PML-RARalpha after the first ATO consolidation course, but 4 remained positive. Administration of the second ATO consolidation course further decreased the transcript levels in 3 patients. In total, 25 patients proceeded to PBSC harvest, all of whom successfully achieved the target CD34+ cell doses, and 23 underwent autologous HCT with PML-RARalpha-negative PBSC graft. Posttransplant relapse occurred in 3 patients, and there was no transplant-related mortality. With a median follow-up of 4.9 years, the 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 65% and 77%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the outstanding efficacy and feasibility of the sequential treatment featuring ATO and autologous HCT for relapsed APL.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in particular has been shown to cause significant morbidity in patients undergoing UCBT. Here, we comprehensively evaluate the development of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses to CMV in a cohort of patients that underwent double UCBT. Our findings demonstrate conclusively that a diverse polyclonal CMV-specific T-cell response derived from the UCB graft is primed to viral antigens as early as day 42 after UCBT, but these T cells fail to achieve sufficient numbers in vivo to control CMV reactivations. This is not due to an inherent inability of UCB-derived T cells to proliferate, as these T cells underwent rapid proliferation in vitro. The TCR diversity and antigen specificity of CMV-specific T cells remained remarkably stable in the first year after transplant, suggesting that later control of virus replication results from improved function of T cells primed early after transplant and not from de novo responses derived from later thymic emigrants. Ex vivo expansion and adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T cells isolated from UCBT recipients early after transplant could augment immunity to CMV.",,"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.']",,,,,,,"['CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA154532/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053193/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K23CA154532-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053193/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3617639,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 15.,"BACKGROUND: Although recent studies have demonstrated an improvement in the prognosis of critically ill cancer patients, little is known regarding the prognosis of patients with non-aggressive underlying malignancies. The aims of this study were to assess the prognosis of critically ill patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to evaluate risk factors for hospital mortality. METHODS: In retrospective mono-center cohort study, consecutive adult patients with CLL requiring ICU admission from 1997 to 2008 were included. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients of 67 years (62-75) were included. Median time interval between CLL diagnosis and ICU admission was 6.7 years (2.6-10.8). Nine patients (15 %) had stage C disease at the time of ICU admission, and seven patients (11 %) had Richter syndrome. Most ICU admissions were related to bacterial or fungal pulmonary infections (n = 47; 76 %). ICU, in-hospital, and 90-day mortality were 35 % (n = 22), 42 % (n = 26), and 58 % (n = 36), respectively. Only three factors were independently associated with in-hospital mortality: oxygen saturation lower than 95 % when breathing room air (odds ratio (OR) 5.80; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.23-27.33), need for vasopressors (OR 27.94; 95 % CI 5.37-145.4), and past history of infection (OR 6.62; 95 % CI 1.34-32.68). The final model did not change when disease-related variables (Binet classification, Richter syndrome, long-term steroids) or treatment-related variables (fludarabine, rituximab, or alemtuzumab) were included. CONCLUSION: Acute pulmonary infections remain the leading cause of ICU admission in patients with CLL. The severity at ICU admission and past history of infection were the only factors associated with hospital mortality. Neither disease characteristics nor previous cancer treatments were associated with outcome.",,"['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, AP-HP, Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 15.,"Single cell transport in microfluidic devices is a topic of interest as their utility is becoming appreciated by cell and molecular biologist. Cell transport should minimize mechanical stress due to friction or pressure gradients. Optical forces have the advantage of applying their forces across the cell volume and not only at the cell membrane and are thus preferable. Optical pushing by scattering force is a suitable candidate so highly dependent on the photon irradiance field inside the propagation capillary which in turn is determined by the waveguide properties delivering the radiation pressure. Here we present a numerical approach to predict the optical scattering force, speed and trajectory of cells as a function of waveguide and propagation capillary geometry. Experimental verification of the simulation approach is demonstrated using polystyrene microspheres and leukemia cells. Effects of optical fibre to waveguide alignment, capillary wall angle and temperature on the dynamic viscosity on speed and position of the microspheres and cells inside the propagation capillary are demonstrated.",,"['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, and Division of Biophotonics and Bioimaging, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. llilge@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current therapies are not very effective against HTLV-1-associated disorders. A novel therapeutic approach may help to combat HTLV-1 infection. A molecular therapy that targets the proviral genome is favorable because the therapeutic effect occurs specifically in HTLV-1-infected cells, regardless of whether they express viral genes. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed a therapeutic molecule based on zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) to achieve this goal. We designed a ZFN that specifically recognized conserved region of HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and introduced it into various HTLV-1-positive human T-cell lines, including HTLV-1-transformed and ATL-derived cell lines. The ZFN disrupted the promoter function of HTLV-1 LTR and specifically killed HTLV-1-infected cells. We also showed a potential approach of this therapeutic molecule to remove the proviral genome from HTLV-1-infected cells, something that has not been possible before.

Epub 2013 Feb 15.,"Cytogenetically normal myelodysplastic syndrome (CN-MDS) can pose diagnostic challenges and its pathogenetic mechanism remains elusive. By focusing on cytogenetically normal refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (CN-RCMD), a subtype of MDS, our genome-wide profiling showed approximately 4600 annotated gene promoters with increased Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in CN-RCMD, when compared with normal controls. Computational analysis revealed a statistically significant enrichment of the PU.1-binding DNA motif (PU-box) in the regions with increased H3K27me3. An inverse relationship between the levels of H3K27me3 and the levels of PU.1 binding and its downstream myeloid gene expressions was observed. Whole-exome sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing analysis revealed some recurrent mutations, but no mutations in the PU.1 regulatory regions or in the EZH1/2, H3K27 methytransferase encoding genes. Using an MDS-derived erythroid/myeloid line and primary MDS bone marrow cells, we demonstrated that H3K27me3 inhibitors can increase the expression of PU.1 and its downstream genes and also promote cell differentiation via reducing H3K27me3 at the PU.1 gene locus. Finally, ectopic expression of PU.1 significantly inhibited proliferation of the MDS-derived cell line. Based on these data, we propose a hypothetical model of epigenetic inactivation of the PU.1 pathway due to increased H3K27me3 in some cases of CN-RCMD.",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. jasonche@med.umich.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Epigenomics. 2013;5(5):482.

Moreover, the incidence and prognostic impact of monosomal karyotypes (MKs), which are new cytogenetic categories reported recently in adults with AML, are currently unknown for childhood and adolescent AML. In this study, we investigated the cytogenetic and clinical characteristics of 140 children and adolescents (</=21 y) with AML, and correlated their cytogenetic features with both the clinical characteristics and outcomes of our patient cohort. The most frequent cytogenetic abnormality found in our study was the t(15;17), followed by the t(8;21). Striking differences in the genetic abnormalities and French-American-British subtypes were found among infants, children, and adolescents. Of 124 cases, 15 (12.1%) met the criteria of the MK definition, and 12 of the 15 MKs (80%) were complex karyotypes. Of 124 cases, 27 (21.8%) had cytogenetic abnormalities sufficient to be diagnosed as AML with myelodyspastic sydrome-related features. As expected, patients with the t(15;17) had the most favorable outcomes, whereas patients with 11q23 rearrangements and monosomy 7 had the worst outcomes. These data expand our knowledge by providing novel insights into the cytogenetic features and their correlations with clinical characteristics and outcomes in childhood and adolescent AML.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Feb 12.,"INTRODUCTION: The epidemiology of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in low and middle income countries is limited. As a result, we analyzed a contemporary cohort of patients from low and middle income countries treated with Imatinib through The Glivec((R)) International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP). METHODS: Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and Kaplan-Meier estimation were utilized to test for regional variations in age at diagnosis and overall survival among 33,985 patients from 94 countries. RESULTS: Patients participated from Asia (79.2%), Africa (9.4%), Latin America (8.7%) and Southern/Eastern Europe (2.5%). Sixty-one (61.2%) percent were male. Mean age at diagnosis was 38.5 years (9.4% <20 years and only 4.7% >/=65 years). Using GEE, Asians were youngest (38.3 years), followed by Africans (39.5 years), Southern/Eastern Europeans (41.1 years) and Latin Americans (41.3 years; p < 0.0001). Diagnoses were predominately in chronic stage (78.3%). In 2002, 85.2% of patients had a delay in treatment >1 year; decreasing to 15.5% in 2010 (p < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival probability was 89.4% (95% CI, 88.9-89.9). In multivariate analysis, risk of death increased among patients 65 years or older at diagnosis (p < 0.0001), time from diagnosis to treatment >1-year (p < 0.0001), diagnoses in the accelerated or blast crisis (p < 0.0001), initial dose of Imatinib >400 mg (p < 0.0001) and among Latin Americans and Africans (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The GIPAP cohort is the largest series of patients with CML described from low and middle income countries. Differences in age at diagnosis and overall survival exist within and between regions. Additional epidemiological studies should be conducted to assess for possible environmental factors associated with the earlier age at onset.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, Gfi1 restricts p53 activity and expression of proapoptotic p53 targets such as Bax, Noxa (Pmaip1), and Puma (Bbc3). Subsequently, Gfi1 ablation cures mice from leukemia and limits the expansion of primary human T-ALL xenografts in mice.

When we induced local DNA damage by ultraviolet irradiation, we also observed accumulation of 53BP1 proteins into discrete bodies, instead of the expected dispersed pattern. In comparison with photomultiplier tubes, which are used for standard analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy, HyDs significantly eliminated photobleaching of GFP and mCherry fluorochromes during image acquisition. The low laser intensities used for HyD-based confocal analysis enabled us to observe NBs for the longer time periods, necessary for studies of the trajectories and interactions of PML and 53BP1 NBs.

Epub 2013 Feb 11.,"Even when faced with elimination, functional materials may offer new alternatives to expensive drugs. Once used to treat benign prostate hypertrophy, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended the use of lonidamine due to the occurrence of liver problems arising from its poor pharmaceutical properties. The objectives of the present study were to develop targeting lonidamine liposomes in combination with targeting epirubicin liposomes to circumvent drug-resistant cancer. Evaluations were performed on A549 and drug-resistant A549cDDP lung cancer cells and drug-resistant A549cDDP xenografted BALB/c nude mice. A DQA-PEG(2000)-DSPE conjugate was incorporated onto the liposomes as a targeting molecule. The constructed targeting lonidamine liposomes and targeting epirubicin liposomes measured were approximately 80 nm. The targeting lonidamine liposomes significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the targeting epirubicin liposomes in the drug-resistant A549cDDP cells in a lonidamine dose-dependent manner. Mechanism studies revealed that the targeting liposomes were selectively accumulated in the mitochondria, dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential, opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pores, and releasing cytochrome C by translocation. This initiated a cascade of caspase 9 and 3 reactions and activated the pro-apoptotic Bax protein while suppressing the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, thereby enhancing the cytotoxic effect by acting on the mitochondrial signaling pathways. The efficacy in treating the drug-resistant A549cDDP xenografted tumor model after administration of the targeting lonidamine liposomes plus targeting epirubicin liposomes was the most significant compared with the administration of the controls at comparable doses. In conclusion, targeting lonidamine liposomes could be used as a potent co-therapy with an anticancer agent to enhance the efficacy of treating drug-resistant cancer by acting on the mitochondrial signaling pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Feb 12.,"OBJECTIVE: To update estimates of cancer risk in SLE relative to the general population. METHODS: A multisite international SLE cohort was linked with regional tumor registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as the ratio of observed to expected cancers. RESULTS: Across 30 centres, 16,409 patients were observed for 121,283 (average 7.4) person-years. In total, 644 cancers occurred. Some cancers, notably hematologic malignancies, were substantially increased (SIR 3.02, 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.48, 3.63), particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, NHL (SIR 4.39, 95% CI 3.46, 5.49) and leukemia. In addition, increased risks of cancer of the vulva (SIR 3.78, 95% CI 1.52, 7.78), lung (SIR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04, 1.60), thyroid (SIR 1.76, 95% CI 1.13, 2.61) and possibly liver (SIR 1.87, 95% CI 0.97, 3.27) were suggested. However, a decreased risk was estimated for breast (SIR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88), endometrial (SIR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.77), and possibly ovarian cancers (0.64, 95% CI 0.34-1.10). The variability of comparative rates across different cancers meant that only a small increased risk was estimated across all cancers (SIR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05, 1.23). CONCLUSION: These data estimate only a small increased risk in SLE (versus the general population) for cancer over-all. However, there is clearly an increased risk of NHL, and cancers of the vulva, lung, thyroid, and possibly liver. It remains unclear to what extent the association with NHL is mediated by innate versus exogenous factors. Similarly, the etiology of the decreased breast, endometrial, and possibly ovarian cancer risk is uncertain, though investigations are ongoing.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, gene fusions as driver mutations in cancer have classically been a distinction in leukemia and other rare instances until recently with the discovery of gene fusion events occurring in 50 to 75% of prostate cancer patients. The discovery of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion sparked an onslaught of discovery and innovation resulting in a delineation of prostate cancer via a molecular signature of gene fusion events. The increased commonality of high-throughput sequencing data coupled with improved bioinformatics approaches not only elucidated the molecular underpinnings of prostate cancer progression, but the mechanisms of gene fusion biogenesis. Interestingly, the androgen receptor (AR), already known to play a significant role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis, has recently been implicated in the processes resulting in gene fusions by inducing the spatial proximity of genes involved in rearrangements, promoting the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSB), and facilitating the recruitment of proteins for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Our increased understanding of the mechanisms inducing genomic instability may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To date, the majority of prostate cancer patients can be molecularly stratified based on their gene fusion status thereby increasing the potential for tailoring more specific and effective therapies.",,"['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",,,,,,,['R00 CA149182/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3733264,['NIHMS490963'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity was seen in all four cell lines; however, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations were significantly higher than in human leukaemia and canine lymphoma cells. AZD1152 reduced Aurora kinase B phosphorylation, indicating resistance was not because of failure of target recognition. Efflux mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters is one known mechanism of resistance against these drugs and verapamil enhanced AZD1152-induced apoptosis; however, these transporters were only expressed by a small percentage of cells in each line and the effects of verapamil were modest, suggesting other mechanisms contribute to resistance.

Vertebra plana can cause severe pain in patients. Bisphosphonates (clodronate, pamidronate and zoledronic acid) have been recently used to treat osteolytic bone lesions of LCH. Zoledronic acid has 100 times relative potency that of pamidronate. We report a case of a 10-year-old girl who had zoledronic acid treatment for severe back pain due to vertebra plana. X-ray photographs of the patient's body showed dense metaphyseal band sign, which can be found in lead poisoning, treated leukemia, healing rickets, recovery from scurvy, vitamin D hypervitaminosis, congenital hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Increased biological potent zoledronic acid deprived her of severe back pain due to vertebra plana and might cause dense metaphyseal band sign of her skeleton. Conclusion; We have cured the severe back pain of a 10-year-old girl case of eosinophilic granuloma with zoledronic acid.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Two strategies for loading doxorubicin into the RBCm-cloaked NPs were compared: physical encapsulation and chemical conjugation. In vitro efficacy was examined using the acute myeloid leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1. RESULTS: It was found that the chemical conjugation strategy resulted in a more sustained drug release profile, and that the RBCm cloak provided a barrier, retarding the outward diffusion of encapsulated drug molecules. It was also demonstrated that RBCm-cloaked NPs exhibit higher toxicity in comparison with free doxorubicin.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to mice on day 7 of gestation led to 100% embryonic resorption after 24 h. In this model, nitric oxide is fundamental for the resorption process. Progesterone may be responsible, at least in part, for a Th2 switch in the feto-maternal interface, inducing active immune tolerance against fetal antigens. Th2 cells promote the development of T cells, producing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which seems to be important due to its immunomodulatory action during early pregnancy. Our aim was to evaluate the involvement of progesterone in the mechanism of LPS-induced embryonic resorption, and whether LIF can mediate hormonal action. Using in vivo and in vitro models, we provide evidence that circulating progesterone is an important component of the process by which infection causes embryonic resorption in mice. Also, LIF seems to be a mediator of the progesterone effect under inflammatory conditions. We found that serum progesterone fell to very low levels after 24 h of LPS exposure. Moreover, progesterone supplementation prevented embryonic resorption and LPS-induced increase of uterine nitric oxide levels in vivo. Results show that LPS diminished the expression of the nuclear progesterone receptor in the uterus after 6 and 12 h of treatment. We investigated the expression of LIF in uterine tissue from pregnant mice and found that progesterone up-regulates LIF mRNA expression in vitro. We observed that LIF was able to modulate the levels of nitric oxide induced by LPS in vitro, suggesting that it could be a potential mediator of the inflammatory action of progesterone. Our observations support the view that progesterone plays a critical role in a successful pregnancy as an anti-inflammatory agent, and that it could have possible therapeutic applications in the prevention of early reproductive failure associated with inflammatory disorders.",,"['Centro de Estudios Farmacologicos y Botanicos (CONICET-UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina. jaisemberg@yahoo.com.ar']",,,,,,,,PMC3567061,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 8.,"BACKGROUND: BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are infrequently detected in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Recent studies indicate the presence of pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations in a higher percentage of CML patients when CD34+ stem/progenitor cells are investigated using sensitive techniques, and these mutations are associated with imatinib resistance and disease progression. However, such studies were limited to smaller number of patients. METHODS: We investigated BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in CD34+ cells from 100 chronic-phase CML patients by multiplex allele-specific PCR and sequencing at diagnosis. Mutations were re-investigated upon manifestation of imatinib resistance using allele-specific PCR and direct sequencing of BCR-ABL kinase domain. RESULTS: Pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations were detected in 32/100 patients and included F311L, M351T, and T315I. After a median follow-up of 30 months (range 8-48), all patients with pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations exhibited imatinib resistance. Of the 68 patients without pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations, 24 developed imatinib resistance; allele-specific PCR and BCR-ABL kinase domain sequencing detected mutations in 22 of these patients. All 32 patients with pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations had the same mutations after manifestation of imatinib-resistance. In imatinib-resistant patients without pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations, we detected F311L, M351T, Y253F, and T315I mutations. All imatinib-resistant patients except T315I and Y253F mutations responded to imatinib dose escalation. CONCLUSION: Pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations can be detected in a substantial number of chronic-phase CML patients by sensitive allele-specific PCR technique using CD34+ cells. These mutations are associated with imatinib resistance if affecting drug binding directly or indirectly. After the recent approval of nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia along with imatinib, all of which vary in their effectiveness against mutated BCR-ABL forms, detection of pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations can help in selection of appropriate first-line drug therapy. Thus, mutation testing using CD34+ cells may facilitate improved, patient-tailored treatment.",,"['College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), National Guards Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. iqbalz@ksau-hs.edu.sa']",,,,,,,,PMC3568121,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"ZNF143 is a zinc-finger protein involved in the transcriptional regulation of both coding and non-coding genes from polymerase II and III promoters. Our study deciphers the genome-wide regulatory role of ZNF143 in relation with the two previously unrelated transcription factors Notch1/ICN1 and thanatos-associated protein 11 (THAP11) in several human and murine cells. We show that two distinct motifs, SBS1 and SBS2, are associated to ZNF143-binding events in promoters of >3000 genes. Without co-occupation, these sites are also bound by Notch1/ICN1 in T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cells as well as by THAP11, a factor involved in self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. We present evidence that ICN1 binding overlaps with ZNF143 binding events at the SBS1 and SBS2 motifs, whereas the overlap occurs only at SBS2 for THAP11. We demonstrate that the three factors modulate expression of common target genes through the mutually exclusive occupation of overlapping binding sites. The model we propose predicts that the binding competition between the three factors controls biological processes such as rapid cell growth of both neoplastic and stem cells. Overall, our study establishes a novel relationship between ZNF143, THAP11 and ICN1 and reveals important insights into ZNF143-mediated gene regulation.",,"[""Architecture et Reactivite de l'ARN, Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, IBMC, 15 rue Rene Descartes, 67084 Strasbourg, France.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3627581,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were purificated based on the expression on the cell surface of a protein. This protein is not present in normal cells of mice and does not interfere with cellular function. This cell surface marker is efficiently recognized by monoclonal antibodies. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived primordial germ like cells were differentiated to spermatogonial stem like cells by inducer cocktail including Retinoic acid (RA)+Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)+Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFgF). Co-culture system was used as a feeder under differentiated cells. A 400 bp fragment of spermatogonia-specific Stra-8 locus was enough to direct gene expression to the germ line stem cells. Stra8-CD4HAglo construct was used for purification of premeiotic differentiated cells. Expression of pluripotency (Pou5F1, Nanog, c-Myc) and specific germ cell (Mvh, Piwil2, Stra-8) genes in each stage were analyzed. The purified cells expressed the known molecular markers of PGC-like cells such as Mvh, Piwil2 & Stra-8. The outcomes of qPCR showed that ratio pluripotency of genes expression in selective group significantly decreased (p</=0.05) in the initial differentiation process. This results showed that ratio of Pou5F1, Nanog, c-Myc, Mvh, Piwil2 & Stra-8 expression to purified PGC-like cells were 0.41, 0.204, 1.1, 0.003, 0.184 and 2.276, respectively. Treatment of cells with RA affected up regulation of Stra-8. Although, c-Myc gene as an oncogenic gene had significantly increased (p</=0.05) at the end of differentiation stage compared to initial phase of study, this level of expression could not be tumorgenic. qPCR results of the differentiation stage showed higher expression of Stra-8 in co-culture+ cocktail and co-culture groups, Also, there was a significant difference (p</=0.05) in the expression of Pou5F1 & Nanog. Our results suggest that selection and purification of PGC-like cells based on Stra-8 as a pre-meiotic marker is a useful tool for getting in vitro spermatogonial stem cell.

Arsenic-containing compounds have been described to be efficacious in malignancies overexpressing EVI1. Here, we describe a case of AML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) treated with the organic arsenical darinaparsin. Using a ""personalized medicine approach,"" two different arsenicals were screened for anti-leukemic effect against the patient's cells ex vivo. The most promising compound, darinaparsin, was selected for in vivo treatment. Clinical effect was almost immediate, with a normalization of temperature, a stabilization of white blood cell (WBC) counts and an increased quality of life. Longitudinal monitoring of patient response and resistance incorporating significant correlative studies on patient-derived blood samples over the two cycles of darinaparsin given to this patient allowed us to evaluate potential mechanisms of response and resistance. The anti-leukemic effects of darinaparsin correlated with inhibition of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway and production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-8. Emergence of resistance was suspected during treatment cycle 2 and supported by xenograft studies in nude mice. Darinaparsin resistance correlated with an attenuation of the effect of treatment on the alternative NF-kappaB pathway. The results from this patient indicate that darinaparsin may be a good treatment option for inv(3) AML and that inhibition of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway may be predictive of response. Longitudinal monitoring of disease response as well as several correlative parameters allowed for the generation of novel correlations and predictors of response to experimental therapy in a heavily pretreated patient.",,"['Segal Cancer Center, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, McGill University Montreal, QC, Canada.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'darinaparsin', 'experimental treatment', 'inv(3)(q21q26.2)', 'personalized medicine', 'resistance']",,PMC3570070,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"The DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) is widely used as an anticancer drug for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors. Gastric cancer (GC) patients who were positive for caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) expression showed a higher survival rate compared with those who were CDX2 negative, which suggests that CDX2 performs a tumor suppressor role. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the inactivation of CDX2 remain unclear. In the present study we demonstrated that the expression levels of CDX2 and DNA methyltransferase enzyme 1 (DNMT1) mRNA were significantly higher in GC compared with distal non-cancerous tissue. The expression of CDX2 mRNA was significantly correlated with Lauren classification, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. DNMT1 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with TNM stage, pathological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. The expression of CDX2 mRNA was inversely correlated with that of DNMT1 mRNA in GC. Hypermethylation of the CDX2 gene promoter region, extremely low expression levels of CDX2 mRNA and no expression of CDX2 protein were the characteristics observed in MKN-45 and SGC-7901 GC cell lines. Following the treatment of MKN-45 cells with 5-aza-CdR, the hypermethylated CDX2 gene promoter region was demethylated and expression of CDX2 was upregulated, while DNMT1 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, a concentration- and time-dependent growth inhibition as well as increased apoptosis were observed. Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities increased in a concentration-dependent manner following exposure to different concentrations of 5-aza-CdR. Therefore, our data show that the overexpression of DNMT1 and methylation of the CDX2 gene promoter region is likely to be responsible for CDX2 silencing in GC. 5-Aza-CdR may effectively induce re-expression of the CDX2 gene, inhibit cell proliferation and enhance the caspase-independent apoptosis of MKN-45 cells in vitro.",,"['Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, P.R.

Deregulation of these tiny miRNAs is involved in various human diseases. MiR-155 is one of the multifunctional miRNA that its over-expression has been found to be associated with different kinds of cancer such as leukemia, breast and colon cancers. It is thought that deregulation and over-expression of this microRNA may be associated with PC12 cell proliferation. So, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-155 expression on PC12 cell growth. For this reason, PC12 cells were cultured and transfected by 3 different concentration (25, 50 and 75 nmol) of either LNA anti-miR-155 or scramble antisense in 24-well plate. Then, total RNA was extracted from transfected cells. miRNA cDNAs were synthesized from isolated total RNA. In the second step, miR-155 expression level was analyzed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). MTT test was performed to evaluate cell viability. In the next step, apoptosis assay was assessed to investigate anti miR-155 effect on PC12 cells death. Obtained results were analyzed with t-test. MTT test revealed that cell viability of transfected cells with 75 nM of anti-miR- 155 to be reduced by half of the control and scramble groups (0.5 vs. 0.97 and 0.94). Our data suggest that miR-155 over-expression is associated with PC12 cell growth.

The KCa3.1 current, isolated in HEL cells under whole cell patch-clamp conditions, displayed an activated current component during depolarizing voltage steps from hyperpolarized holding potentials and tail currents upon repolarization, consistent with voltage-dependent modulation. This activated current increased with increasing voltage steps above -40 mV and was sensitive to inhibition by clotrimazole, TRAM-34, and charybdotoxin and insensitive to apamin, paxilline, and iberiotoxin. In single-channel experiments, depolarization resulted in an increase in open channel probability (Po) of KCa3.1, with no increase in channel number.

However, in many cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies, differentiation or apoptosis can be induced by variety of agents. Despite advances in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), in most patients long-term survival rates remain unsatisfactory, especially in T-cell derived ALL. Thus we studied the anti-cancer effects of fenretinide, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), and bryostatin-1 in CCRF-CEM (T-cell derived) and Nalm-6 (B-cell derived) ALL cell lines. Using MTT assays, both cell lines were shown to exhibit increased inhibition of proliferation at micro (fenretinide) and nanomolar (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), bryostatin-1) concentrations. These anti-cancer agents were shown to induce apoptosis and activate caspase-3 pathway in both ALL cell lines. Furthermore, for the first time we are reporting consistent anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of Bryostatin-1 in ALL T-cell derived cell line with the lowest ED(50) (ranging 4.6-7.4 nM). To evaluate the differentiation induction by fenretinide, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), and bryostatin-1 in ALL cell lines, we assayed for the expressions of CD19, CD38 markers on Nalm-6 and CD7 marker on CCRF-CEM cell line. The flow cytometric analysis showed a significant increase in expression of CD markers in response to anti-cancer drug treatments. To assay the effects of anti-cancer drugs on cell cycle distribution, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry was employed. These anti-cancer drugs appear to affect the CCRF-CEM and Nalm-6 cell cycles differently (G0/G1 and G2/M arrest, respectively). Overall results demonstrate that the anti-cancer agents used in this study are strong inhibitors of ALL cell proliferation and inducers of apoptosis and differentiation in vitro.

This is a major problem, which may result in fractures, loss of mobility, and deformity, with resultant adverse effects on quality of life. Here, we studied the clinical and radiological musculoskeletal manifestations in children with AL. We reviewed 328 children [208 boys (62%), median age 7.2 years] with acute lymphoblastic (279, 85%) or myeloid (49, 15%) leukemia, treated between January 1982 and December 2003 by the Paediatric Oncology Service, Second University of Naples. The group was further divided into two groups: group 1 included 255 patients (78%, 163 boys) without skeletal morbidity at diagnosis, and group 2 included 73 patients (22%, 41 boys) with musculoskeletal symptoms. This group was further subdivided into group 2A (56 patients), which included children with symptoms related to the appendicular skeleton, and group 2B (17 patients), which included children with symptoms related to the axial skeleton. Moreover, we also reported the long-term complications of therapy, such as osteonecrosis of the weight-bearing joints. In group 2A, 44 children presented only pain, seven septic arthritis-type symptoms, and five osteomyelitis-type symptoms. Joint compression was in the tibia-tarsus (21 patients), knee (16), coxofemoral (12), and elbow (seven). In group 2B, 11 patients presented with vertebral collapses. The remaining six patients complained of localized pain in the lumbar-sacral area, with limited flexor and extensor muscle capacity. Fifty-five (75.3%) patients showed radiographic abnormalities: osteoporosis in 22 patients (40%), pathological fractures in 11 (20%), osteolysis in 10 (18.1%), osteosclerosis in five (9%), periosteal reactions in four (7.2%), and metaphyseal bands in three (5.4%). Four (1.2%) patients in total showed avascular necrosis (4.3% when only high-risk patients were considered). At presentation, 22% of our children had at least one musculoskeletal manifestation and 75.3% showed one radiographic change. Our study highlights the importance of including AL in the differential diagnosis of musculoskeletal manifestations. Four cases of avascular necrosis confirm the need for regular check-ups, both orthopedic and nonorthopedic, particularly in adolescent girls, to prevent permanent disability.",,"['aDepartment of Paediatrics, Paediatric Oncology Service bDepartment of Orthopaedics, Second University of Naples, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"Recent studies have suggested that the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) conjugation pathway may play an important role in intrinsic antiviral resistance and thus for repression of herpesviral infections. In particular, it was shown that the herpes simplex virus type-1 regulatory protein ICP0 acts as a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL), inducing the widespread degradation of SUMO-conjugated proteins during infection. As the IE1 protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is known to mediate a de-SUMOylation of PML, we investigated whether HCMV uses a similar mechanism to counteract intrinsic antiviral resistance. We generated primary human fibroblasts stably expressing FLAG-SUMO-1 or FLAG-SUMO-3 and analysed the SUMOylation pattern after HCMV infection or isolated IE1 expression. However, Western blot experiments did not reveal a global loss of SUMO conjugates, either in HCMV-infected or in IE1-expressing cells, arguing against a function of IE1 as an STUbL. Interestingly, we observed that FLAG-SUMO-1 and FLAG-SUMO-3, subsequent to IE1-mediated promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) de-SUMOylation and the consequent disruption of PML nuclear bodies, were recruited into viral replication compartments. This raised the question of whether FLAG-SUMO-1/3 might promote HCMV replication. Intriguingly, overexpression of FLAG-SUMO-1/3 enhanced accumulation of viral DNA, which correlated with an increase in viral replication and in virus particle release. Together, these data indicate that HCMV, in contrast to other herpesviruses, has evolved subtle mechanisms enabling it to utilize the SUMO conjugation pathway for its own benefit, resulting in an overall positive effect of SUMO conjugation for HCMV replication.",,"['Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Fahrstr. 17, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One factor solely expressed by uterine glands in mice is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and Lif null mice are infertile because of defective blastocyst attachment to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE). Progesterone treatment of neonatal mice permanently ablates differentiation of uterine glands, resulting in an aglandular uterus in the adult. Progesterone-induced uterine gland knockout (PUGKO) mice were used to investigate the biological role of uterine glands in blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization. As compared to controls, PUGKO mice cycled normally but were infertile. Histological assessment of PUGKO uteri on Days 5.5 and 8.5 postmating found a hatched blastocyst apposed to an intact LE without evidence of implantation or stromal cell decidualization. Expression of several implantation-related factors, including Lif and PTGS2, were altered in the PUGKO uterus, whereas expression of steroid hormone receptors and their regulated genes was not different. Artificial decidualization was observed in the uteri of control but not PUGKO mice. Further, intrauterine administration of LIF failed to promote artificial decidualization in the uterus of PUGKO mice. Thus, uterine glands and their secretions have important biological roles in blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization in the uterus.",,"['Center for Reproductive Biology, Department of Animal Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164-6310, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Biol Reprod. 2013 Apr;88(4):94.

To the best of our knowledge there has been not any study specifically to analyze apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of 4-HPR (a vitamin analog) in NB-4 cell line. To test whether this drug has activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we first analyzed the anti-proliferative effect of 4-HPR in one AML cell line (NB-4) using MTT Assay. Next we tested whether this drug induced apoptotic cell death. The ability of this compound to induce apoptosis of cancer cells was examined by Annexin V-FITC Assay using Flow cytometry. We also analyzed the cell cycle progression by PI staining using flow cytometry. Using MTT assay, NB-4 cells exhibited increased inhibition of proliferation at micromolar concentrations of 4-HPR at 24, 48 and 72 hrs post treatment. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that 4-HPR is a potent inducer of in vitro apoptotic cell death, and cell cycle analysis revealed an increase in S phase population. In total, the results indicate that 4-HPR is a strong inhibitor of AML cell proliferation and a potent inducer of in vitro apoptotic cell death.

This knowledge has dramatically improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of MPNs and has facilitated the development of therapeutics capable of suppressing the constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, now recognized as a common underlying biologic abnormality in MPNs. Ruxolitinib is an oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor that has recently been approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and has been tested against other hematologic malignancies. A series of agents with different specificities against different members of the JAK family of proteins is currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials for patients with MPNs, lymphoma, and solid tumors such as breast or pancreatic cancer. Despite the significant clinical activity exhibited by these agents in myelofibrosis, some patients fail to respond or progress during JAK kinase inhibitor therapy. Recent reports have shed light into the mechanisms of resistance to JAK inhibitor therapy. Several approaches hold promise to overcome such resistance.",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5021219,['NIHMS814209'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Epigenetic inactivation of MIR129-2 was studied by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in 13 cell lines (eight myeloma and five lymphoma), 15 normal controls and 344 primary samples including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM) at diagnosis, MM at relapse/progression, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Expression of MIR129 and its target, SOX4, in cell lines was measured before and after hypomethylating treatment and MIR129 overexpression. MIR129 expression was correlated with MIR129-2 methylation status in primary lymphoma samples. Tumor suppressor function of MIR129 was demonstrated by MTT and trypan blue exclusion assay after MIR129 overexpression. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the methylated-MSP was one in 10(3). Different MSP statuses, including complete methylation, partial methylation, and complete unmethylation, were verified by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. All five lymphoma and seven of eight myeloma cell lines showed complete and partial MIR129-2 methylation. In primary samples, MIR129-2 methylation was absent in AML and CML, but detected in 5% ALL, 45.9% CLL, 49.5% MM at diagnosis, and 59.1% NHL. In CLL, MIR129-2 methylation adversely impacted on survival (p=0.004). In MM, MIR129-2 methylation increased from 27.5% MGUS to 49.5% MM at diagnosis and 41.5% at relapse/progression (p=0.023). In NHL, MIR129-2 methylation was associated with MIR124-1 and MIR203 methylation (p<0.001), and lower MIR129 expression (p=0.009). Hypomethylation treatment of JEKO-1, homozygously methylated for MIR129-2, led to MIR129-2 demethylation and MIR129 re-expression, with downregulation of SOX4 mRNA. Moreover, MIR129 overexpression in both mantle cell lines, JEKO-1 and GRANTA-519, inhibited cellular proliferation and enhanced cell death, with concomitant SOX4 mRNA downregulation. CONCLUSIONS: MIR129-2 is a tumor suppressive microRNA frequently methylated in lymphoid but not myeloid malignancies, leading to reversible MIR129-2 silencing. In CLL, MIR129-2 methylation was associated with an inferior survival. In MM, MIR129-2 methylation might be acquired during progression from MGUS to symptomatic MM. In NHL, MIR129-2 methylation might collaborate with MIR124-1 and MIR203 methylation in lymphomagenesis.",,"['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",,,,,,,,PMC3576298,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Annonacaea) grows widely in the south and southeast regions of Thailand. Preliminary screening for biological activities revealed that crude hexane, ethyl acetate, and acetone extracts from mixtures of leaves and twigs of P. rugosa showed cytotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: Chemical constituents and their antiproliferative activity in K562, U937, and HL-60 human leukemic cell lines from P. rugosa were performed for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolated compounds were obtained from chromatographic separation. The structures were established by spectroscopic techniques including IR, UV, NMR together with 2D NMR (HMBC, COSY, and NOE) and MS. The K562, U937, and HL-60 cell lines were treated with isolated aporphine alkaloids (0-100 microg/mL) and cell viability was measured with the MTT assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide (PI) based staining methods. RESULTS: Two known aporphine alkaloids, 1,2,3-trimethoxy-5-oxonoraporphine (1) and ouregidione (2) were isolated. Treatment of the cells with compounds 1 and 2 at a concentration of 100 microg/mL for 72 h reduced the viability of K562, U937, and HL-60 cell lines to 63 and 64, 38 and 66, and 49 and 64%, respectively. In addition, compounds 1 and 2, at a concentration of 100 microg/mL, exposed to U937 and HL-60 cell lines showed cell cycle arrest. The U937 cell line treated with compounds 1 and 2 increased significantly the proportion of the cell in S phase, whereas the HL-60 cell line-induced G2/M and G1 phase, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results showed that 1,2,3-trimethoxy-5-oxonoraporphine and ouregidione-induced cytotoxicity with HL-60, U937, and K562 cells where 1,2,3-trimethoxy-5-oxonoraporphine was more active than ouregidione.",,"['Laboratory of Natural Products, Faculty of Science and Center for Innovation in Chemistry, Lampang Rajabhat University, Lampang, Thailand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mouse models of thyroid cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine. Their effects in humans are not known. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib. RESULTS: Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated. The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men. Nine patients had tumors with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had tumors with mutations of NRAS. Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). Eight of these 12 patients reached the dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy, including all 5 patients with NRAS mutations. Of the 8 patients treated with radioiodine, 5 had confirmed partial responses and 3 had stable disease; all patients had decreases in serum thyroglobulin levels (mean reduction, 89%). No toxic effects of grade 3 or higher attributable by the investigators to selumetinib were observed. One patient received a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome more than 51 weeks after radioiodine treatment, with progression to acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.

HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene has a critical role in HTLV-1 infectivity and the development of ATL and HAM/TSP. However, little is known about the immune response against HBZ in HTLV-1-infected individuals. In this study, we examined antibody responses against HBZ in serum/plasma samples from 436 subjects including HTLV-1 seronegative donors, asymptomatic carriers (AC), ATL, and HAM/TSP patients using the luciferase immunoprecipitation system. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity against HBZ was detected in subsets of all HTLV-1-infected individuals but the test did not discriminate between AC, ATL and HAM/TSP. However, the frequency of detection of HBZ-specific antibodies in the serum of ATL patients with the chronic subtype was higher than in ATL patients with the lymphomatous subtype. Antibody responses against HBZ were also detected in cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients with anti-HBZ in serum. Antibody responses against HBZ did not correlate with proviral load and HBZ mRNA expression in HAM/TSP patients, but the presence of an HBZ-specific response was associated with reduced CD4+ T cell activation in HAM/TSP patients. Moreover, HBZ-specific antibody inhibited lymphoproliferation in the PBMC of HAM/TSP patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating humoral immune response against HBZ associated with HTLV-I infection. Thus, a humoral immune response against HBZ might play a role in HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",,,,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3584941,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The 20th anniversary of his death provides us with the opportunity to discuss the role of this brilliant scholar in the international development of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene. METHODS: A comprehensive analysis of Vigliani's scientific works was conducted. In addition, his close collaborators and pupils were interviewed. RESULTS: In the 1930s, as a young doctor, Vigliani, first in the world, demonstrated the effect of lead on porphyrin metabolism. Afterwards he conducted pioneering studies on occupational oncology (benzene-induced leukaemia, bladder cancer due to aromatic amines, asbestos-related tumours), pathogenesis of silicosis, encephalopathy in carbon disulfide poisoning, byssinosis and metal fume fever, so influencing international research and the implementation of preventive measures against these conditions. Vigliani's scientific authority was widely recognized internationally, as confirmed by his role in ICOH. During his period of active service, the Commission developed from an academic institution to a more open association, substantially increasing its membership. Furthermore, he contributed to establishing subcommittees devoted to specific topics (now called ""scientific committees""), one of the strengths of the present Commission. CONCLUSIONS: Vigliani's contribution to the development of Occupational Health may be considered as an expression of his genial eclecticism which ranged from clinical medicine to the environment.",,"['Research Centre on Public Health, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. michele.riva@unimib.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Vigiliani EC'],"['Vigiliani, Enrico Carlo']",,,,

In contrast, FeLV-B is thought to arise de novo in the infected animal through RNA recombination events with endogenous FeLV transcripts, presumably through copackaging of RNA from endogenous FeLV and exogenous FeLV-A. Here, we report the complete genome sequences of two novel strains of FeLV-B (FeLV-2518 and FeLV-4314) that were isolated in the absence of FeLV-A. The env genes of these isolates have been characterized previously, and the 3' recombination sites have been identified. We describe herein the 5' recombination breakpoints of each virus. These breakpoints were found to be within the signal peptide of the env gene and the reverse transcriptase-coding region, respectively. This is the first report of a recombination site within the pol gene of an FeLV-B genome and the first genetic characterization of multiple independently arising FeLV-B isolates that have been identified without a functional FeLV-A ancestral virus.",,"['Medical Research Council, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,"['BB/D008425/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0300387/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC3569371,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 6.,"Genomic instability stemming from dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage response (DDR) is a common feature of many cancers. The cancer adult T cell leukemia (ATL) can occur in individuals infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and ATL cells contain extensive chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that they have defects in the recognition or repair of DNA damage. Since Tax is the transforming protein encoded by HTLV-1, we asked whether Tax can affect cell cycle checkpoints and the DDR. Using a combination of flow cytometry and DNA repair assays we showed that Tax-expressing cells exit G(1) phase and initiate DNA replication prematurely following damage. Reduced phosphorylation of H2AX (gammaH2AX) and RPA2, phosphoproteins that are essential to properly initiate the DDR, was also observed in Tax-expressing cells. To determine the cause of decreased DDR protein phosphorylation in Tax-expressing cells, we examined the cellular phosphatase, WIP1, which is known to dephosphorylate gammaH2AX. We found that Tax can interact with Wip1 in vivo and in vitro, and that Tax-expressing cells display elevated levels of Wip1 mRNA. In vitro phosphatase assays showed that Tax can enhance Wip1 activity on a gammaH2AX peptide target by 2-fold. Thus, loss of gammaH2AX in vivo could be due, in part, to increased expression and activity of WIP1 in the presence of Tax. siRNA knockdown of WIP1 in Tax-expressing cells rescued gammaH2AX in response to damage, confirming the role of WIP1 in the DDR. These studies demonstrate that Tax can disengage the G(1)/S checkpoint by enhancing WIP1 activity, resulting in reduced DDR. Premature G(1) exit of Tax-expressing cells in the presence of DNA lesions creates an environment that tolerates incorporation of random mutations into the host genome.",,"['Interdepartmental Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",,,,,,,"['P30 AI036211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024148/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3566092,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 6.,"Rho family guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, play a fundamental role in various cellular processes. The activation of Rho proteins is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP. The precise mechanisms regulating the activation of Rho proteins are not fully understood. Herein, we demonstrate that RhoA activity is regulated by cylindromatosis (CYLD), a deubiquitinase harboring multiple functions. In addition, we find that RhoA-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement, chromosome separation, and cell polarization are altered in CYLD-depleted cells. Mechanistically, CYLD does not interact with RhoA; instead, it interacts with and deubiquitinates leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). Our data further show that CYLD-mediated deubiquitination of LARG enhances its ability to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange on RhoA. These data thus identify LARG as a new substrate of CYLD and provide novel insights into the regulation of RhoA activation. Our results also suggest that the LARG-RhoA signaling pathway may play a role in diverse CYLD-mediated cellular events.",,"['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science and Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3566121,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ESC matrix is continuously remodeled by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a process that we find is enhanced by the presence of mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders in a paracrine manner. Matrix remodeling by MMPs aids in the self-renewal of ESCs, as inhibition of MMPs inhibits the ability of ESCs to self-renew. We also find that addition of the interstitial collagenase MMP1 is sufficient to maintain long-term leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-independent mouse ESC (mESC) self-renewal in a dose-dependent manner. This remarkable ability is due to the presence of endogenously produced self-renewal-inducing signals, including the LIF-family ligand ciliary neurotrophic factor, that are normally trapped within the ECM and become exposed upon MMP-induced matrix remodeling to signal through JAK and Stat3. These results uncover a new role for feeder cells in maintaining self-renewal and show that mESCs normally produce sufficient levels of autocrine-acting pro-self-renewal ligands.",['Copyright (c) 2013 AlphaMed Press.'],"['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 EB007278/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD045022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 045022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'EB007278/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD045022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3664106,['NIHMS453204'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"A novel drug named Dasatinib is a highly potent ATP-competitive orally active dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor with anti-proliferative activity against solid tumors and CML (chronic myeloid leukaemia) cell lines. Dasatinib has been shown to have preclinical activity against human prostate, breast, pancreatic, lung, and head and neck cancer. To determine whether Dasatinib can inhibit the growth of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, in the present study, we investigated the antitumor effect of Dasatinib on Hep-2 cells. Hep-2 cells were treated with different concentrations of Dasatinib for different time. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell apoptosis were evaluated using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and fluorescent microscopy. It was found that Dasatinib exhibited significant efficacy in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis induction in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Measuring the modulation of regulators in the cell cycle, apoptosis and signal transductions by western blot analysis showed that the effect of Dasatinib was due to suppression of the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Caspase-8. Moreover, in vivo studies were performed in a nude mouse xenograft model, the new prescription (DDP + Dasatinib) was better than DDP alone in terms of therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, the antitumor effect of Dasatinib on Hep-2 cells was due to the induction of cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis. The possible mechanisms underlying the action might be attributed to the suppression of Src phosphorylation. This investigation suggests a potential clinical application of Dasatinib for the treatment of laryngeal cancer patients.",,"['Department of Otolaryngology, Sheng-Jing Hospital, China Medical University, 110004 Shenyang, People Republic China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3608870,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions between inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and HLA class I ligands seem to be critically involved in the immunosurveillance process. It is also well established that mismatching of HLA class I-encoded KIR ligands in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation leads to allorecognition of leukemic cells by NK cells, which is in line with the concept of missing-self recognition. Recent data now suggest that KIR gene polymorphism constitutes another important parameter that needs to be taken into account for selection of suitable stem cell donors.

Epub 2013 Mar 25.,"Some studies have indicated that children born after fertility treatment have a potential risk for cancer, but the results are inconsistent. Furthermore, any negative effects of fertility treatment might be due to the underlying infertility rather than to the procedure itself. In the largest cohort study to date with information on fertility, we examined whether the offspring of women with fertility problems had a higher risk for cancer than offspring of women without fertility problems. The study cohort consisted of 2,830,054 offspring born in Denmark between 1964 and 2006. Of these, 125,844 were offspring of women evaluated for infertility. Cox regression models were used to estimate the possible effect of being the offspring of a woman evaluated for infertility on the risk for cancer. Analyses were performed separately for cancer during childhood (0-19 years) and cancer in young adulthood (>20 years). We found that offspring born to women with fertility problems had higher overall risks for cancer in childhood (hazard ratio (HR), 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.32) and in young adulthood (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43) than offspring of women without fertility problems. Offspring of women with fertility problems had significantly increased risks for leukemia in childhood (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.60) and for cancer of the endocrine glands in young adulthood (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.35-5.29). These findings suggest that offspring born to mothers with fertility problems are at increased risk for cancer in both childhood and young adulthood. If real, our findings of an approximately 18% overall increase in risk for cancer in childhood and an approximately 22% overall increase in risk for cancer in young adulthood would mean about four additional cases of childhood cancer and about nine additional cases of cancer in young adults per 100,000 exposed offspring.",['Copyright (c) 2013 UICC.'],"['Unit of Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer', 'fertility treatment', 'infertility']",['ZIA CP010126-18/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4154232,['NIHMS621174'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the associations between childhood acute leukemia (AL) and maternal caffeinated beverage consumption during pregnancy, and to explore interactions between caffeinated and alcoholic beverage consumption and polymorphisms of enzymes involved in caffeine and ethanol metabolisms. METHODS: The data were generated by the French ESCALE study, which included 764 AL cases and 1,681 controls in 2003-2004. The case and control mothers were interviewed on their consumption habits during pregnancy using a standardized questionnaire. Genotypes of the candidate alleles (NAT2*5 rs1801280, ADH1C*2 rs698 and rs1693482, CYP2E1*5 rs2031920 and rs3813867) were obtained using high-throughput genotyping and imputation data for 493 AL cases and 549 controls with at least two grandparents born in Europe. RESULTS: Maternal regular coffee consumption during pregnancy was associated with childhood AL (OR = 1.2 [1.0-1.5], p = 0.02); the odds ratios increased linearly with daily intake (p for trend <0.001; >2 cups per day vs. no or less than 1 cup per week: AL: OR = 1.6 [1.2-2.1], lymphoblastic AL: OR = 1.5 [1.1-2.0], myeloblastic AL: OR = 2.4 [1.3-4.3]). The association was slightly more marked for children born to non-smoking mothers. Lymphoblastic AL was also associated with cola soda drinking (OR = 1.3 [1.0-1.5], p = 0.02). No significant gene-environment interactions with coffee, tea, cola soda, or alcohol drinking were observed. CONCLUSION: This study provides additional evidence that maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy may be associated with childhood AL.

However, the role of Hsp27 in the pathogenesis of pediatric acute leukemia (AL) remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of Hsp27 in bone marrow samples from 94 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5 leukemia cell lines. Additionally, we transfected a target-specific siRNA duplex against Hsp27 into leukemia cells, and examined the chemosensitivity and cell apoptosis in the response to antitumor drugs. Hsp27 was abundantly expressed in newly diagnosed AML-M4/M5 bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and THP-1, OCI/AML-3 leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, its expression was positively correlated with the clinical status in pediatric M4/M5 subtypes. Knockdown of Hsp27 expression increased the chemosensitivity of leukemia cells and the anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. These results support the theory that Hsp27 plays a contributory role in the pathogenesis of pediatric AML-M4/M5. Therefore, Hsp27 may be exploited as a new target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs against leukemia.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"PURPOSE: Although the importance of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-3 has been demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the role of VEGFR-3 in functioning natural killer (NK) cells remains largely unexplored. NK cells can destroy cancer cells by releasing the cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma, but NK cells in AML patients (AML NK cells) have low cytolytic activity. In the present study, we investigated whether lymphatic markers including VEGFR-3 are expressed on low-functioning AML NK cells and VEGFR-3 antagonist can restore expression of IFN-gamma in NK cells. METHODS: Samples from 67 de novo AML patients and 34 healthy donors were analyzed for lymphatic markers expression using RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunostaining. For the cytotoxicity assays, K562 cells and AML NK cells were used as target and effector cells, respectively. To block VEGFR-3, MAZ51 was added to NK cells, which were then subjected to FACS analysis. RESULTS: Compared with NK cells from healthy donors (healthy NK cells), AML NK cells exhibited higher levels of VEGFR-3 and lower expression of IFN-gamma. VEGFR-3-expressing AML NK cells were less potent than healthy NK cells in terms of killing K562 cells. The level of IFN-gamma in AML NK cells was increased by VEGFR-3 antagonist treatment, indicating the functional relevance of VEGFR-3 in IFN-gamma-secreting NK cells. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest a relationship between VEGFR-3 and IFN-gamma expression in NK cells and raise the possibility of advanced therapeutic approaches involving VEGFR-3 antagonist treatment prior to NK immune cell therapy in AML.",,"[""Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 505 Banpo 4-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 137-701, Korea.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 12.,"Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and glutamine to asparagine and glutamate in an ATP-dependent reaction. The enzyme is ubiquitous in its organ distribution in mammals, but basal expression is relatively low in tissues other than the exocrine pancreas. Human ASNS activity is highly regulated in response to cell stress, primarily by increased transcription from a single gene located on chromosome 7. Among the genomic elements that control ASNS transcription is the C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) within the promoter. Protein limitation or an imbalanced dietary amino acid composition activate the ASNS gene through the amino acid response (AAR), a process that is replicated in cell culture through limitation for any single essential amino acid. Endoplasmic reticulum stress also increases ASNS transcription through the PERK-eIF2-ATF4 arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Both the AAR and UPR lead to increased synthesis of ATF4, which binds to the CARE and induces ASNS transcription. Elevated expression of ASNS protein is associated with resistance to asparaginase therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be a predictive factor in drug sensitivity for certain solid tumors as well. Activation of the GCN2-eIF2-ATF4 signaling pathway, leading to increased ASNS expression appears to be a component of solid tumor adaptation to nutrient deprivation and/or hypoxia. Identifying the roles of ASNS in fetal development, tissue differentiation, and tumor growth may reveal that ASNS function extends beyond asparagine biosynthesis.",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shands Cancer Center and Center for Nutritional Sciences, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 DK092062/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK094729/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-92062/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-94729/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3625782,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this open-label phase I study, vorinostat was given orally on days one to seven at three escalating dose levels: 200 mg twice a day, 200 mg three times a day, and 300 mg twice a day. On days 11 to 14, etoposide (100 mg/m(2)) and cytarabine (1 or 2 g/m(2) twice a day if >/=65 or <65 years old, respectively) were given. The study used a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. RESULTS: Eighteen of 21 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) treated on study completed planned therapy. Dose-limiting toxicities [hyperbilirubinemia/septic death (1) and anorexia/fatigue (1)] were encountered at the 200 mg three times a day level; thus, the MTD was established to be vorinostat 200 mg twice a day. Of 21 patients enrolled, seven attained a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery, including six of 13 patients treated at the MTD. The median remission duration was seven months. No differences in percentage S-phase cells or multidrug resistance transporter (MDR1 or BCRP) expression or function were observed in vivo in leukemia blasts upon vorinostat treatment.

Epub 2013 Feb 1.,"OBJECTIVES: Toxic death is a big problem in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially in low-income countries. Studies of ciprofloxacin as single agent prophylaxis vary widely in success rate. We conducted a double-blind, randomized study to test the effects of ciprofloxacin monotherapy as prophylaxis for sepsis and death in induction treatment of the Indonesian childhood ALL protocol. METHODS: Patients were randomized to the ciprofloxacin arm (n = 58) and to the placebo arm (n = 52). Oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy or oral placebo was administered twice a day. All events during induction were recorded: toxic death, abandonment, resistant disease, and complete remission rate. RESULTS: Of 110 patients enrolled in this study, 79 (71.8%) achieved CR. In comparison to the placebo arm, the ciprofloxacin arm had lower nadir of absolute neutrophil count during induction with median of 62 (range: 5-884) versus 270 (range: 14-25,480) x 10(9) cells/L (P < 0.01), greater risks for experiencing fever (50.0% versus 32.7%, P = 0.07), clinical sepsis (50.0% versus 38.5%, P = 0.22), and death (18.9% versus 5.8%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: In our setting, a reduced intensity protocol in a low-income situation, the data warn against using ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during induction treatment.

The MLL-AF9 fusion gene has been shown to induce leukemia in both mouse and human models. In this study, we demonstrate that leukemogenic activity of MLL-AF9 requires RUVBL2 (RuvB-like 2), an AAA+ ATPase family member that functions in a wide range of cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Expression of RUVBL2 was dependent on MLL-AF9, as it increased upon immortalization of human cord blood-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells with the fusion gene and decreased following loss of fusion gene expression in conditionally immortalized mouse cells. Short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing experiments demonstrated that both the immortalized human cells and the MLL-AF9-expressing human leukemia cell line THP-1 required RUVBL2 expression for proliferation and survival. Furthermore, inhibition of RUVBL2 expression in THP-1 cells led to reduced telomerase activity and clonogenic potential. These data were confirmed with a dominant-negative Walker B-mutated RUVBL2 construct. Taken together, these data suggest the possibility of targeting RUVBL2 as a potential therapeutic strategy for MLL-AF9-associated leukemia.",,"['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",,,,,,,"['100140/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present population-based estimates of cure for young patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Europe from 1982 to 2002. Thirty-five European cancer registries provided data. Survival was estimated by age, period of diagnosis and European region, and used as input for parametric cure models, which assume cured patients have the same mortality as the general population. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed in 1-14 year olds in 2000-2002, over 77% were estimated cured. The proportion cured improved significantly over the study period: an impressive 26-58% in infants (up to 1 year), 70-90% in 1-4 year olds, 63-86% in 5-9 year olds, 52-77% in 10-14 year olds, and 44-50% in 15-24 year olds. Regional variations in proportion cured reduced over time for 1-14 year-olds, but persisted in infants and 15-24 year olds. Five-year survival was always slightly higher than proportion cured. Considerable proportions of young patients were estimated cured of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Thrombopoietin levels were consistently low for patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts, while patients with other myelodysplatic syndrome subsets had more variable results.

Epub 2013 Feb 12.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in infants represents an aggressive malignancy associated with a high incidence (approx. 80%) of translocations involving the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene. Attempts to mimic Mixed Lineage Leukemia fusion driven leukemogenesis in mice raised the question whether these fusion proteins require secondary hits. RAS mutations are suggested as candidates. Earlier results on the incidence of RAS mutations in Mixed Lineage Leukemia-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia are inconclusive. Therefore, we studied frequencies and relation with clinical parameters of RAS mutations in a large cohort of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Using conventional sequencing analysis, we screened neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog gene (NRAS), v-Ki-ras Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene (KRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 gene (BRAF) for mutations in a large cohort (n=109) of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and studied the mutations in relation to several clinical parameters, and in relation to Homeobox gene A9 expression and the presence of ALL1 fused gene 4-Mixed Lineage Leukemia (AF4-MLL). Mutations were detected in approximately 14% of all cases, with a higher frequency of approximately 24% in t(4;11)-positive patients (P=0.04). Furthermore, we identified RAS mutations as an independent predictor (P=0.019) for poor outcome in Mixed Lineage Leukemia-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with a hazard ratio of 3.194 (95% confidence interval (CI):1.211-8.429). Also, RAS-mutated infants have higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis (P=0.013), and are more resistant to glucocorticoids in vitro (P<0.05). Finally, we demonstrate that RAS mutations, and not the lack of Homeobox gene A9 expression nor the expression of AF4-MLL are associated with poor outcome in t(4;11)-rearranged infants. We conclude that the presence of RAS mutations in Mixed Lineage Leukemia-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia is an independent predictor for a poor outcome. Therefore, future risk-stratification based on abnormal RAS-pathway activation and RAS-pathway inhibition could be beneficial in RAS-mutated infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.",,"[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3669451,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 12.,"Asparaginase is an expensive drug, but important in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In order to compare costs of PEGasparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase and native E. coli asparaginase, we performed a cost-analysis in the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-10 medium-risk group intensification protocol. Treatment costs were calculated based on patient level data of 84 subjects, and were related to the occurrence of allergy to PEGasparaginase. Simultaneously, decision tree and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The total costs of the intensification course of 30 weeks were $57,893 in patients without PEGasparaginase allergy (n=64). The costs were significantly higher ($113,558) in case of allergy (n=20) necessitating a switch to Erwinia asparaginase. Simulated scenarios (decision tree analysis) using native E. coli asparaginase in intensification showed that the costs of PEGasparaginase were equal to those of native E. coli asparaginase. Also after sensitivity analyses, the costs for PEGasparaginase were equal to those of native E. coli asparaginase. Intensification treatment with native E. coli asparaginase, followed by a switch to PEGasparaginase, and subsequently to Erwinia asparaginase in case of allergy had similar overall costs compared to the treatment with PEGasparaginase as the first-line drug (followed by Erwinia asparaginase in the case of allergy). PEGasparaginase is preferred over native E. coli asparaginase, because it is administered less frequently, with less day care visits. PEGasparaginase is less immunogenic than native E. coli asparaginase and is not more expensive. Asparaginase costs are mainly determined by the percentage of patients who are allergic and require a switch to Erwinia asparaginase.",,"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3640120,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, animal model experiments over the last several years have produced a very different picture of how p15Ink4b functions in hematopoietic cells and how its loss contributes to myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemia. It is clear now, that in early hematopoietic progenitors, p15Ink4b functions outside of its canonical role as a cell cycle inhibitor.

Epub 2013 Feb 9.,"BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia is the most common cancer in children under 15 years of age; 80% are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 17% are acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Childhood leukemia shows further diversity based on cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, which may relate to distinct etiologies. Case-control studies conducted worldwide, particularly of ALL, have collected a wealth of data on potential risk factors and in some studies, biospecimens. There is growing evidence for the role of infectious/immunologic factors, fetal growth, and several environmental factors in the etiology of childhood ALL. The risk of childhood leukemia, like other complex diseases, is likely to be influenced both by independent and interactive effects of genes and environmental exposures. While some studies have analyzed the role of genetic variants, few have been sufficiently powered to investigate gene-environment interactions. OBJECTIVES: The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) was established in 2007 to promote investigations of rarer exposures, gene-environment interactions and subtype-specific associations through the pooling of data from independent studies. METHODS: By September 2012, CLIC included 22 studies (recruitment period: 1962-present) from 12 countries, totaling approximately 31000 cases and 50000 controls. Of these, 19 case-control studies have collected detailed epidemiologic data, and DNA samples have been collected from children and child-parent trios in 15 and 13 of these studies, respectively. Two registry-based studies and one study comprising hospital records routinely obtained at birth and/or diagnosis have limited interview data or biospecimens. CONCLUSIONS: CLIC provides a unique opportunity to fill gaps in knowledge about the role of environmental and genetic risk factors, critical windows of exposure, the effects of gene-environment interactions and associations among specific leukemia subtypes in different ethnic groups.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint models and the World Health Organization mortality and population database, we estimated numbers of deaths and age-standardized (world) mortality rates (ASRs) in 2013 from all cancers and selected cancers. RESULTS: The 2013 predicted number of cancer deaths in the EU is 1 314 296 (737 747 men and 576 489 women). Between 2009 and 2013, all cancer ASRs are predicted to fall by 6% to 140.1/100 000 in men, and by 4% to 85.3/100 000 in women. The ASRs per 100 000 are 6.6 men and 2.9 women for stomach, 16.7 men and 9.5 women for intestines, 8.0 men and 5.5 women for pancreas, 37.1 men and 13.9 women for lung, 10.5 men for prostate, 14.6 women for breast, and 4.7 for uterine cancer, and 4.2 and 2.6 for leukaemia. Recent trends are favourable except for pancreatic cancer and lung cancer in women. CONCLUSIONS: Favourable trends will continue in 2013.

De novo synthesis of most proteins is regulated through cap-dependent translation. Cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) blocks cap-dependent translation resulting in shut-down of global protein translation which saves resources and energy needed for the stress response. At the same time, levels of proteins required for stress response are maintained or even increased. The study aimed to analyze the regulation of signaling pathways controlling protein translation in response to IR and the impact on Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic and radioprotective protein, which levels rapidly decline upon IR. METHODS: Protein levels and processing were analyzed by Western blot. The assembly of the translational pre-initiation complex was examined by Immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments with 7-methyl GTP agarose. To analyze IR-induced cell death, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation were determined by flow cytometry. Protein levels of the different initiation factors were down-regulated using RNA interference approach. RESULTS: IR induced caspase-dependent cleavage of the translational initiation factors eIF4G1, eIF3A, and eIF4B resulting in disassembly of the cap-dependent initiation complex. In addition, DAP5-dependent initiation complex that regulates IRES-dependent translation was disassembled in response to IR. Moreover, IR resulted in dephosphorylation of 4EBP1, an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation upstream of caspase activation. However, knock-down of eIF4G1, eIF4B, DAP5, or 4EBP1 did not affect IR-induced decline of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that cap-dependent translation is regulated at several levels in response to IR. However, the experiments indicate that IR-induced Mcl-1 decline is not a consequence of translational inhibition in Jurkat cells.",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Str, 3, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,PMC3577660,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 26.,"Originally identified as an innate cytotoxin, nitric oxide ((.)NO) formation in tumors can influence chemotherapy and exacerbate cancer progression. Here, we examined the hypothesis that (.)NO generation contributes to cancer cell drug resistance toward the widely used anticancer drug Etoposide (VP-16). The UV-vis spectrum of VP-16 was not changed by exposure of VP-16 to (.)NO in aqueous buffer. In contrast, reddish-orange compound(s) characteristic of o-quinone- and nitroso-VP-16 were readily generated in a hydrophobic medium (chloroform) in an oxygen-dependent manner. Similar products were also formed when the VP-16 radical, generated from VP-16 and horseradish peroxidase/H2O2, was exposed directly to (.)NO in chloroform in the presence of oxygen. Separation and spectral analysis of VP-16 reaction extracts by electron spin resonance and UV-vis indicated the generation of the phenoxy radical and the o-quinone of VP-16, as well as putative nitroxide, iminoxyl, and other nitrogen oxide intermediates. Nitric oxide products of VP-16 displayed significantly diminished topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA and cytotoxicity to human HL-60 leukemia cells. LPS-mediated induction of nitric oxide synthase in murine macrophages resulted in VP-16 resistance compared to Raw cells. Furthermore, (.)NO products derived from iNOS rapidly reacted with VP-16 leading to decreased DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Together, these observations suggest that the formation of (.)NO in tumors (associated macrophages) can contribute to VP-16 resistance via the detoxification of VP-16.",,"['Laboratory of Toxicology & Pharmacology, National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, United States.']",,,,,,,"['ZIA ES050117-22/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA ES050139-18/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3697829,['NIHMS468167'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry showed robust Stat3 phosphorylation in the lung epithelium. We identified that a critical Stat3 target gene in lung epithelium is Reg3g (regenerating islet-derived 3 gamma), a gene which is highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelium but whose role in pulmonary host defense is uncharacterized. Stat3 regulated Reg3g transcription through direct binding at the Reg3g promoter region. Recombinant Reg3gamma bound to SA and had both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent fashion.

Epub 2013 Feb 11.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasia arising from the oncogenic break point cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 translocation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in a leukemia stem cell (LSC). Curing CML depends on the eradication of LSCs. Unfortunately, LSCs are resistant to current treatment strategies. The host's immune system is thought to contribute to disease control, and several immunotherapy strategies are under investigation. However, the interaction of the immune system with LSCs is poorly defined. In the present study, we use a murine CML model to show that LSCs express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory molecules and are recognized and killed by leukemia-specific CD8(+) effector CTLs in vitro. In contrast, therapeutic infusions of effector CTLs into CML mice in vivo failed to eradicate LSCs but, paradoxically, increased LSC numbers. LSC proliferation and differentiation was induced by CTL-secreted IFN-gamma.

VEGF-A acts by binding to its membrane receptors R1 and R2 present in soluble forms (sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2) with different functions. sVEGFR could inhibit VEGF-A bioactivities, associated with favorable prognosis in solid tumors. However, its role is obscure in central nervous system leukemia (CNSL). The aim of this study was to investigate sVEGFR1, R2 as biomarkers in CNSL. Paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples were collected from 35 leukemia cases with or without CNS metastasis. Levels of sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2 in both CSF (sVEGFR1CSF, sVEGFR2CSF) and serum (sVEGFR1Serum, sVEGFR2Serum) were detected by ELISA. Other risk factors related to CNSL prognosis were also analyzed. sVEGFRSerum levels were 2.54-fold (sVEGFR1) and 25.6-fold (sVEGFR2) higher than sVEGFRCSF in both leukemic groups. sVEGFR1CSF in CNSL were 33 % higher than in the non-CNSL, and the levels of sVEGFR2CSF and sVEGFR2Serum had the same trend. Elevated sVEGFR1CSF and sVEGFR2CSF is closely correlated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) values and WBCCSF that is an indicator of CNSL disease burden. Cox regression analysis showed that the sVEGFR2CSF had a positive effect on event-free survival. Our data suggest that sVEGFR2CSF may be more potent than sVEGFR1CSF in predicting the outcome of leukemia patients, the balance between sVEGFR2CSF and VEGF-ACSF levels might be crucial for the progression of CNSL.",,"['Department of Hematology Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, 57 Changping Road, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the specific contributions of the two related genes STAT5A and STAT5B have not been determined. In this study, we used a RNAi-based strategy to establish participation of these genes to CML disease and persistence following targeted therapy. We showed that STAT5A/STAT5B double-knockdown triggers CML cell apoptosis and suppresses both normal and CML HSC long-term clonogenic potential. STAT5A and STAT5B exhibited similar prosurvival activity, but STAT5A attenuation alone was ineffective at impairing growth of normal and CML CD34(+) cells isolated at diagnosis. In contrast, STAT5A attenuation was sufficient to enhance basal oxidative stress and DNA damage of normal CD34(+) and CML cells. Furthermore, it weakened the ability to manage exogenous oxidative stress, increased p53 (TRP53)/CHK-2 (CHEK2) stress pathway activation, and enhanced prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-3 (EGLN3) mRNA expression. Only STAT5A and its transactivation domain-deficient mutant STAT5ADelta749 specifically rescued these activities. STAT5A attenuation was also active at inhibiting growth of CML CD34(+) cells from patients with acquired resistance to imatinib. Our findings show that STAT5A has a selective role in contributing to stress resistance through unconventional mechanisms, offering new opportunities to eradicate the most primitive and tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML cells with an additional potential to eradicate persistent stem cell populations.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Inserm U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JMML remains a disease for which few curative therapies are available other than myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT); however, relapse remains a major cause of treatment failure and the long-term morbidities of HSCT for survivors are substantial. A hallmark feature of JMML is acquired hypersensitivity by clonal myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) via a largely unknown mechanism. Here, we identify c-Cbl (henceforth referred to as Cbl) as a GM-CSF receptor (GMR) adaptor protein that targets Src for ubiquitin-mediated destruction upon GM-CSF stimulation and show that a loss of negative regulation of Src is pivotal in the hyperactivation of GMR signaling in Cbl-mutated JMML cells. Notably, dasatinib, an U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved multikinase inhibitor that also targets Src family, dramatically attenuated the spontaneous and GM-CSF-induced hypersensitive growth phenotype of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow collected from JMML patients harboring Cbl or other known JMML-associated mutations.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors inhibit deacetylases and accumulate high levels of acetylation lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with chaetocin enhanced apoptosis in human leukemia HL60, KG1, Kasumi, K562, and THP1 cells. In addition, chaetocin induced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15), E-cadherin (CDH1) and frizzled family receptor 9 (FZD9) through depletion of SUV39H1 and reduced H3K9 methylation in their promoters. Co-treatment with chaetocin and HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) dramatically increased apoptosis and produced greater activation of genes. Furthermore, this combined treatment significantly increased loss of SUV39H1 and reduced histone H3K9 trimethylation responses accompanied by increased acetylation.

Due to its expression in many blood-organ barriers, it also influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs and drug candidates and is involved in drug/drug- and drug/nutrient interactions. However, due to lack of structural information the molecular basis of ligand/transporter interaction still needs to be elucidated. Towards this goal, a series of Benzopyranes and Benzopyrano[3,4b][1,4]oxazines have been synthesized and pharmacologically tested for their ability to inhibit P-gp mediated daunomycin efflux. Both quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models using simple physicochemical and novel GRID-independent molecular descriptors (GRIND) were established to shed light on the structural requirements for high P-gp inhibitory activity. The results from 2D-QSAR showed a linear correlation of vdW surface area (A(2)) of hydrophobic atoms with the pharmacological activity. GRIND (3D-QSAR) studies allowed to identify important mutual distances between pharmacophoric features, which include one H-bond donor, two H-bond acceptors and two hydrophobic groups as well as their distances from different steric hot spots of the molecules. Activity of the compounds particularly increases with increase of the distance of an H-bond donor or a hydrophobic feature from a particular steric hot spot of the benzopyrane analogs.",,"['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria. ishrat_chem@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,['F 3502/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC3589648,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristics of the RB plasma jet such as electrical properties, plasma gas temperature and nitric oxides concentration were determined using voltage-current characterization, optical emission spectroscopy and gas analyzer diagnostic techniques. Plasma discharge power of 26.33 W was calculated from voltage-current characterization. An optical emission spectroscopy was applied and the gas temperature which is equivalent to the nitrogen rotational (T<inf>rot</inf>) temperatures was measured. The concentrations of the reactive oxygen species at different spatial distances from the tip of the plasma jet were measured and the ppm concentration of NO is at the preferred level for a wide range of standard biomedical treatment applications. The ppm values of nitric oxides after the cooling unit are observed to be of the same order of magnitude as compared to plasma jet. The portable RB plasma source was tested to be very effective for decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of foodborne and opportunistic nosocomial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and the preliminary results are presented.

Here, we find that cholecystokinin (Cck) is a direct transcriptional target of CLOCK and levels of Cck are reduced in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of ClockDelta19 mice. Selective knockdown of Cck expression via RNA interference in the VTA of wild-type mice produces a manic-like phenotype. Moreover, chronic treatment with lithium restores Cck expression to near wild-type and this increase is necessary for the therapeutic actions of lithium. The decrease in Cck expression in the ClockDelta19 mice appears to be due to a lack of interaction with the histone methyltransferase, MLL1, resulting in decreased histone H3K4me3 and gene transcription, an effect reversed by lithium. Human postmortem tissue from bipolar subjects reveals a similar increase in Cck expression in the VTA with mood stabilizer treatment.

Many proinflammatory cytokines secreted following the conditioning regimen have been linked to aGVHD initiation. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a cytokine related to IL-10 for its structure and is secreted by T helper type 17 (TH17) cells and innate immune cells. Given the paradoxical role of IL-22 in inflammation with both protective or proinflammatory functions, we investigated whether IL-22 could have a role in aGVHD pathophysiology in a mouse allo-HCT model. In this study, we show that IL-22 deficiency in donor T cells can decrease the severity of aGVHD, while limiting systemic and local inflammation in aGVHD target organs. In addition, we found that Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) were increased in recipient mice that received IL-22-deficient T cells, suggesting that Treg were involved in the reduced severity of GVHD. Finally, we found that the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect mediated by donor T cells was preserved in the absence of IL-22. Overall, these data suggest that targeting of IL-22 may represent a valid approach towards decreasing aGVHD severity after allo-HCT while preserving the GVL effect.",,"['INSERM UMR1098, Besancon, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Y177 of BCR-ABL is critical to the development of myeloid disease, and phosphorylation of Y177 has been shown to induce GRB2 binding to BCR-ABL, followed by activation of the Ras and phosphoinositide 3 kinase signaling pathways. We show that the GRB2-related adapter protein, GADS, also associates with BCR-ABL, specifically through Y177 and demonstrate that BCR-ABL-driven lymphoid disease requires Gads. BCR-ABL transduction of Gads(-/-) bone marrow results in short latency myeloid disease within 3-4 weeks of transplant, while wild-type mice succumb to both a longer latency lymphoid and myeloid diseases. We report that GADS mediates a unique BCR-ABL complex with SLP-76 in BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and B-ALL patient samples. These data suggest that GADS mediates lymphoid disease downstream of BCR-ABL through the recruitment of specific signaling intermediates.",,"['Campbell Family Cancer Research Institute, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,"['12859-4/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'MOP#42428/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'MOP#12859/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",PMC4981500,['CAMS4013'],,,,,,,,,['NLM: CAMS4013'],,,

Epub 2012 Dec 27.,"Cholesterol-laden macrophages trigger accumulation of foam cells and increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that quercetin could lower the content of cholesterol in macrophages by regulating the expression of the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene in differentiated human acute monocyte leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells and thereby reducing the chance of forming foam cells. Quercetin, in concentrations up to 30 muM, was not cytotoxic to differentiated THP-1 cells. Quercetin up-regulated both ABCA1 messenger RNA and protein expression in differentiated THP-1 cells, and its maximum effects were demonstrated at 0.3 muM for 4 to 8 hours in incubation. In addition, quercetin increased protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) within 2 hours of treatment. Because PPARgamma and LXRalpha are important transcriptional factors for ABCA1, quercetin-induced up-regulation of ABCA1 may be mediated by increased expression levels of the PPARgamma and LXRalpha genes. Furthermore, quercetin-enhanced cholesterol efflux from differentiated THP-1 cells to both high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A1. Quercetin at the dose of 0.15 muM elevated the cholesterol efflux only for HDL. At the dose of 0.3 muM, quercetin demonstrated effects both on HDL and apolipoprotein A1. Our data demonstrated that quercetin increased the expressions of PPARgamma, LXRalpha, and ABCA1 genes and cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. Quercetin-induced expression of PPARgamma and LXRalpha might subsequently affect up-regulation of their target gene ABCA1. Taken together, ingestion of quercetin or quercetin-rich foods could be an effective way to improve cholesterol efflux from macrophages, which would contribute to lowering the risk of atherosclerosis.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The chemotherapy induced anemia (CIA) and hemorrhage are the most popular side-effects due to the myelosuppression of chemotherapy. So far, multitransfusion is still the timely and effective measure in curing these complications. The acquisition of HIV infection and subsequent development of AIDS by component transfusion from donors at risk is well known, and prognosis of HIV infection is particularly severe in patients with leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two leukemic cases that were infected with HIV through transfusion. The first patient was totally transfused with 16 U RBC, 20 U platelets and 820 ml fresh frozen plasma, and later test showed that his first used FFP carried the HIV. For the second 2 U RBC, 5 U platelets and 1500 ml fresh frozen plasma were transfused to her. Late test of her used blood products showed that the fourth RBC carried the HIV. Both results were confirmed by the local Center for Disease Control (CDC). They were not transfused before the diagnosis of leukemia. Their parents were healthy with negative HIV-Ab. CONCLUSION: Since the two leukemic patients suffered transfusion-associated HIV with poor prognosis, we must take more efforts to utilize blood products judiciously, manage blood donors, test blood samples etiologically, shorten HIV testing ""window periods"" and develop preventive vaccination against HIV to reduce the incidence as low as possible.",,"[""Division of Clinical Laboratory, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.""]",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AIDS', 'Blood Treansfusion', 'HIV', 'Leukemia']",,PMC3564102,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 8.,"BACKGROUND: The association of neutrophilic dermatoses with myeloid disorders is well known, but neutrophilic panniculitis in the same setting has only been reported infrequently. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to better characterize these lesions clinically and histologically, and to provide a comprehensive differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic approach. METHODS: The pathology archives were searched for cases of neutrophilic panniculitis in patients with myeloid disorders. Clinical history and histologic features were studied. Similar cases in the English-language literature were reviewed. RESULTS: Five biopsy specimens from 4 patients and 11 previous case reports were identified. All patients presented with erythematous tender nodules typically involving the extremities. Most were accompanied by fevers, and resolved either spontaneously or with steroids. Histologically, the subcutaneous neutrophilic infiltrates demonstrated lobular or, less frequently, septal patterns with minimal dermal involvement. Leukocytoclasis, fat necrosis, reactive stromal fibroblasts, and mild reticular dermal edema were each seen in at least 3 of our 5 biopsy specimens. No myeloid blasts, vascular changes, or non-Miescher granulomas were observed. No micro-organisms were identified in the skin nodules. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by the small number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the fairly consistent clinical and histologic findings, neutrophilic panniculitis occurring in the setting of myeloid disorders is best classified as subcutaneous Sweet syndrome after exclusion of infectious panniculitis, id reaction, and leukemia cutis. These lesions may be associated with myeloid disorders, or induced by chemotherapy or other medications.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Unlike other cancers, much of this progress is attributable to refinement of supportive treatment, rather than the introduction of new drugs. New antibacterial and antifungal agents, antiemetics, and improved transfusion support have decreased the rate of early death, and morbidity and mortality from allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been substantially reduced. However, more than half of young adult patients and about 90% of older patients still die from their disease. Refractoriness to initial induction treatment and, more frequently, relapse after complete remission, are still the main obstacles to cure. Accordingly, new treatment approaches with mechanisms of action different from those of conventional chemotherapy are needed. Our knowledge of the various chromosomal and molecular abnormalities implicated in the pathogenesis of the many subtypes of the disease has greatly expanded; as a result, clinical research is moving towards the investigation of new non-cytotoxic agents in combination with chemotherapy. The goal is to target the molecular abnormalities identified at diagnosis; however, several aberrations can coexist in subclones of acute myeloid leukaemia, making the disease less likely to be inhibited by a single agent.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The gene encoding TPMT is polymorphic, and both phenotyping and genotyping studies have shown ethnic variations in gene sequence and enzyme activity worldwide. The aim of this study is to identify the most common genetic polymorphisms of TPMT in healthy Jordanian volunteers and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was used to identify the frequency of TPMT (*2, *3A, *3B, and *3C) polymorphisms in 250 healthy Jordanian volunteers and 110 RA patients. RESULTS: Only four healthy subjects (1.6%) and one RA patient (0.9%) with variant alleles were identified in this study. Two healthy subjects had the TPMT*3A allele and the other two had the TPMT*3B allele, whereas the one RA patient had the TPMT*3A allele. No homozygous polymorphisms were detected and all genotypes detected were heterozygous (*1/*3A) (*1/*3B). None of the subjects had TPMT*2 or TPMT*3C variant alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Mutant alleles identified in this study have a low frequency. TPMT (*3A and *3B) were the only detected heterozygous alleles. No homozygous variant allele was detected.

Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Idarubicin (IDA), in comparison to daunorubicin (DNR), reduced remission failure rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-0.99; P = 0.04), but did not alter rates of early death or overall mortality. Superiority of IDA for remission induction was limited to studies with a DNR/IDA dose ratio <5 (ratio <5: RR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.81; P < 0.001; ratio >/=5: RR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91-1.16; P = 0.63). Higher-dose DNR, compared to lower-dose DNR, was associated with reduced rates for remission failure (RR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.94; P = 0.003) and overall mortality (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93; P < 0.001), but not for early death. Comparisons of several other anthracycline derivates did not reveal significant differences in outcomes. Survival estimates in adults suggest that both high-dose DNR (90 mg/m(2) daily x 3 or 50 mg/m(2) daily x 5) and IDA (12 mg/m(2) daily x 3) can achieve 5-year survival rates of between 40 and 50 percent.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"[""Division of Haematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital Berne, Berne, Switzerland.""]",,,,,,,['87719/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 11.,"A marked increase in leukemia risks was the first and most striking late effect of radiation exposure seen among the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. This article presents analyses of radiation effects on leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors updated 14 years since the last comprehensive report on these malignancies. These analyses make use of tumor- and leukemia-registry based incidence data on 113,011 cohort members with 3.6 million person-years of follow-up from late 1950 through the end of 2001. In addition to a detailed analysis of the excess risk for all leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia or adult T-cell leukemia (neither of which appear to be radiation-related), we present results for the major hematopoietic malignancy types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Poisson regression methods were used to characterize the shape of the radiation dose-response relationship and, to the extent the data allowed, to investigate variation in the excess risks with gender, attained age, exposure age and time since exposure. In contrast to the previous report that focused on describing excess absolute rates, we considered both excess absolute rate (EAR) and excess relative risk (ERR) models and found that ERR models can often provide equivalent and sometimes more parsimonious descriptions of the excess risk than EAR models. The leukemia results indicated that there was a nonlinear dose response for leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia or adult T-cell leukemia, which varied markedly with time and age at exposure, with much of the evidence for this nonlinearity arising from the acute myeloid leukemia risks. Although the leukemia excess risks generally declined with attained age or time since exposure, there was evidence that the radiation-associated excess leukemia risks, especially for acute myeloid leukemia, had persisted throughout the follow-up period out to 55 years after the bombings. As in earlier analyses, there was a weak suggestion of a radiation dose response for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men, with no indication of such an effect among women. There was no evidence of radiation-associated excess risks for either Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma.",,"['Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.']",,,,,,,"['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA CP010134-17/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-2009-00005/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3875218,['NIHMS528248'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Our study was conducted on 90 patients with de novo AML and 60 healthy subjects with matched age and sex. We studied polymorphisms in three DNA repair genes; XRCC1, XRCC3, and XPD. We also assessed the incidence of the NQO1 gene polymorphism. We genotyped the polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism. CONCLUSION: The distribution of XRCC1Arg 339Gln genotypes showed a significant difference between patients and controls (p=0.025). The presence of at least one XRCC1 399Gln allele indicated an increased risk of AML and the proportion of AML patients homozygous for the Gln/Gln allele was significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.025). However, distributions of the XRCC3 Thr241Met, XPD Lys751Gln, and NQO1Pro 187Ser genotypes were not significantly different between patients and controls. Combined analysis of the studied DNA repair gene polymorphisms did not show an interaction with the detoxification NQO1 Pro187Ser polymorphism.",,"['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 9.,"The clinical outcomes of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have improved greatly, but treatment failure still occurs. Identification of patients with poor prognosis is fundamental, and we propose a new clinical prognostic system (CBC-score) consisting of WBC, platelet count, and hemoglobin level. Between 1995 and 2009, 156 patients with APL from seven institutes in Korea were retrospectively reviewed. In the new CBC-score system, each of the following (WBC >/= 10 x 109/L, platelet <40 x 109/L, hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL) was considered as a risk factor; the sum of each was designated as the CBC-score. With a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the complete remission (CR) rate was 81.4 % (127/156), while 24 (15.4 %) were considered as treatment failures due to early death (ED). The 5-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse were 73.8, 82.8, and 13.5 %, respectively. Compared to the individual CBC parameters, combined prognostic systems such as PETHEMA or CBC-score provided better prognostic stratification. Compared to PETHEMA stratification, the proposed prognostic CBC-score system showed better stratification of APL patients in terms of CR rates (p = 0.004), OS (p = 0.004), and ED (p = 0.008). This retrospective study suggests that the proposed CBC-score may provide better prognostic stratification of APL patients.",,"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Meidical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 50, Irwon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, 135-710, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Int J Hematol. 2014 Jan;99(1):100-1.

During the study period of retrospective work (1982-1996), the first 10 years were carried out while Estonia was still under the mentorship of the Soviet Union. Over these years, Estonian hematologists did not have access to therapeutic measures readily available to Swedish hematologists, and the results for survival for western Swedish patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) far exceeded those of their Estonian counterparts. However, the results for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were equally dismal in the two countries. Subsequent prospective population-based studies were carried out during the years 1997-2006. A gradual improvement as to long-term relative survival of the Estonian AML patients was observed. When studying 2002-2006, no difference as regards relative survival at 5 years was anymore present between the two countries. Over the first 20 years of our population-based studies, it was repeatedly observed that the age-standardized incidence rate particularly for de novo AML was considerably higher for the western Swedish as compared to the Estonian cohorts. During the last 5-year study period (2002-2006), no such difference between the two countries was present, indicating that some true changes in the reporting procedure in Estonia had occurred.",,"['Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Tartu University Clinic, Tartu, Estonia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 8.,"The study objective was to investigate factors that affect the central nervous system (CNS) distribution of elacridar. Elacridar inhibits transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and has been used to study the influence of transporters on brain distribution of chemotherapeutics. Adequate distribution of elacridar across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and into the brain parenchyma is necessary to target tumor cells in the brain that overexpress transporters and reside behind an intact BBB. We examined the role of P-gp and Bcrp on brain penetration of elacridar using Friend leukemia virus strain B wild-type, Mdr1a/b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice. Initially, the mice were administered 2.5 mg/kg of elacridar intravenously, and the plasma and brain concentrations were determined. The brain-to-plasma partition coefficient of elacridar in the wild-type mice was 0.82, as compared with 3.5 in Mdr1a/b(-/-) mice, 6.6 in Bcrp1(-/-) mice, and 15 in Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice, indicating that both P-gp and Bcrp limit the brain distribution of elacridar. The four genotypes were then administered increasing doses of elacridar, and the CNS distribution of elacridar was determined. The observed and model predicted maximum brain-to-plasma ratios (Emax) at the highest dose were not significantly different in all genotypes. However, the ED50 was lower for Mdr1a/b(-/-) mice compared with Bcrp1(-/-) mice. These findings correlate with the relative expression of P-gp and Bcrp at the BBB in these mice and demonstrate the quantitative enhancement in elacridar CNS distribution as a function of its dose. Overall, this study provides useful concepts for future applications of elacridar as an adjuvant therapy to improve targeting of chemotherapeutic agents to tumor cells in the brain parenchyma.",,"['Department of Pharmaceutics, Brain Barriers Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 CA138437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3608446,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The program was carried out in cooperation with ROKPA INTERNATIONAL, a non-profit organization (NGO) that aims at helping the poorest peoples living in remote regions of the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hand-held US scanner (Sonosite 180 Plus, Sonosite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) equipped with a 3.5-5 MHz convex probe was used at a local clinic for 21 days in 2007 and for 32 days in 2009. RESULTS: A total of 1128 US examinations were performed (578 in 2007 and 550 in 2009). The main diagnoses were: Echinococcal cysts (66 cases; 6.23%) - Biliary tract and intrahepatic gallstones (10% of patients examined) - Ascariasis - Acute and chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, abdominal masses - Abdominal tuberculosis - Miscellaneous (trophoblastic tumor, megacalicosis, splenomegaly in acute leukemia). After the first experience in 2007, collaboration with the local hospital was established for the treatment of patients affected by active echinococcal cysts using albendazole and puncture, aspiration and injection of scolicidal agent and re-aspiration (PAIR) and subsequent follow-up. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: US scanning was well accepted by the local population and allowed diagnosis, classification and choice of treatment of the echinococcal cysts according to recent criteria based on a stage-specific approach. Percutaneous treatment was also introduced, but more training of local healthcare providers is needed to secure continuation of this practice. Further experience may help improve the standard of health care services offered to the nomadic populations in this remote area.",,"['Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cystic echinococcosis', 'International cooperation', 'Ultrasonography']",,PMC3558098,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of colon rupture was confirmed by CT scan. The patient underwent successful hemicolectomy after intravenous treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusion.

Patients with LGL lymphocytosis showed an OS advantage (86.2 vs 53.8%, P<0.001), lower non-relapse mortality (NRM; 3.2 vs 27.3%, P<0.001) and lower relapse incidence (9.6 vs 29.4%, P<0.001). Three clinical factors were associated with the development of LGL lymphocytosis: (1) CMV seropositive recipients (CMV-R(+)) compared with CMV seronegative recipients (CMV-R(-); P<0.001) regardless of CMV serostatus of donor; (2) CMV reactivation (P<0.001); (3) chronic GVHD (P=0.007). In conclusion, the incidence of LGL lymphocytosis following allogeneic hematopoietic SCT was detected in ~20% of recipients and is associated with favorable outcomes.",,"['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. drkiim@medimail.co.kr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 8.,"Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) constitutes an important alternative for patients lacking a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor. Although the use of haploidentical donors is increasingly common, the long-term impact of generating a donor-derived immune system in the context of an HLA-mismatched thymic environment remains poorly characterized. We performed an in-depth assessment of immune reconstitution in a group of haploidentical HSCT recipients 4 to 6 years posttransplantation, in parallel with the respective parental donors and age-matched healthy control subjects. Our data show that the proportion of naive and memory subsets in the recipients, both within CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, more closely resembled that observed in age-matched control subjects than in the donors. HSCT recipients displayed relatively high signal-joint T cell-receptor excision circle levels and a high frequency of the recent thymic emigrant-enriched CD31(+) subset within naive CD4(+) and naive regulatory T cells. Moreover, CD8(+), CD4(+), and regulatory T cells from HSCT recipients displayed a diverse T cell repertoire. These results support a key role for thymic output in T cell reconstitution. Nevertheless, HSCT recipients had significantly shorter telomeres within a naive-enriched CD4(+) T cell population than age-matched control subjects, despite the similar telomere length observed within the most differentiated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell subsets. Overall, our data suggest that long-term immune reconstitution was successfully achieved after haploidentical HSCT, a process that appears to have largely relied on de novo T cell production.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Feb 5.,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an exceedingly rare disorder categorized under acute myeloid leukemia by the World Health Organization. Phenotypically, malignant cells coexpress CD4(+) and CD56(+) without coexpressing common lymphoid or myeloid lineage markers. BPDCN frequently expresses CD123, TCL1, BDCA-2, and CD2AP. Restriction of CD2AP expression to plasmacytoid dendritic cells makes it a useful tool to help confirm diagnosis. Clonal complex chromosome aberrations are described in two-thirds of cases. Eighty percent of BPDCN cases present with nonspecific dermatological manifestations, prompting inclusion in the differential diagnosis of atypical skin rashes refractory to standard treatment. Prognosis is poor, with a median survival of less than 18 months. No prospective randomized data exist to define the most optimal frontline chemotherapy. Current practice considers acute myeloid leukemia-like or acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like regimens acceptable for induction treatment. Unfortunately, responses are short-lived, with second remissions difficult to achieve, underscoring the need to consider hematopoietic cell transplantation early in the disease course. Allografting, especially if offered in first remission, can result in long-term remissions. Preclinical data suggest a potential role for immunomodulatory agents in BPCDN. However, further research efforts are needed to better understand BPDCN biology and to establish evidence-based treatment algorithms that might ultimately improve overall prognosis of this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Feb 8.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic studies have yielded important insights into the pathogenesis of obesity. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are valuable biomarkers of systemic diseases and potential therapeutic targets. We sought to define the circulating pattern of miRNAs in obesity and examine changes after weight loss. METHODS: We assessed the genomewide circulating miRNA profile cross-sectionally in 32 men and after surgery-induced weight loss in 6 morbidly obese patients. The most relevant miRNAs were cross-sectionally validated in 80 men and longitudinally in 22 patients (after surgery-induced weight loss). We evaluated the effects of diet-induced weight loss in 9 obese patients. Thirty-six circulating miRNAs were associated with anthropometric variables in the initial sample. RESULTS: In the validation study, morbidly obese patients showed a marked increase of miR-140-5p, miR-142-3p (both P < 0.0001), and miR-222 (P = 0.0002) and decreased levels of miR-532-5p, miR-125b, miR-130b, miR-221, miR-15a, miR-423-5p, and miR-520c-3p (P < 0.0001 for all). Interestingly, in silico targets leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and transforming growth factor receptor (TGFR) of miR-140-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-15a, and miR-520c-3p circulated in association with their corresponding miRNAs. Moreover, a discriminant function of 3 miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-520c-3p, and miR-423-5p) was specific for morbid obesity, with an accuracy of 93.5%. Surgery-induced (but not diet-induced) weight loss led to a marked decrease of miR-140-5p, miR-122, miR-193a-5p, and miR-16-1 and upregulation of miR-221 and miR-199a-3p (P < 0.0001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miRNAs are deregulated in severe obesity. Weight loss-induced changes in this profile and the study of in silico targets support this observation and suggest a potential mechanistic relevance.",['(c) 2013 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.'],"[""Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Girona, Girona, Spain.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Chem. 2013 May;59(5):729-31.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) and Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) are non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that are primarily expressed in cells of hematopoietic lineage. Both are key mediators in coupling activated immunoreceptors to downstream signaling events that affect diverse biological functions, from cellular proliferation, differentiation and adhesion to innate and adaptive immune responses. As such, pharmacological inhibitors of SYK or BTK are being actively pursued as potential immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Deregulation of SYK or BTK activity has also been implicated in certain hematological malignancies. To date, from a clinical perspective, pharmacological inhibition of SYK activity has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) have benefited from covalent inhibitors of BTK in early clinical studies. Here, we review and discuss recent insights into the emerging role of the SYK-BTK axis in innate immune cell function as well as in the maintenance of survival and homing signals for tumor cell progression.

Epub 2013 Feb 5.,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a stem cell disorder, and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) can contribute to the relapse of the disease. Quiescent LSCs are BCR-ABL independent and resistant to imatinib; therefore, there is an unmet need to identify new therapeutic targets in LSCs. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1-positive cells was effective in vitro, but in a pilot clinical trial, only a few patients responded to the treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that mTOR activation in CML CD34(+) progenitor cells is ERK dependent in chronic phase of the disease and ERK independent in blast crisis. Rapamycin effectively inhibits mTOR in all phases of CML, but does not reduce number of LSC-enriched CD34(+) blast crisis (BC) cells, neither alone nor in combination with imatinib in CML-BC cells.

In vitro ozonization of C16:0-CE was found to form the palmitoyl ester of secosterol-A (3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al) and its aldolization product secosterol-B (3beta-hydroxy-5beta-hydroxy-B-norcholestane-6beta-carboxaldehyde). On the other hand, when C18:1-CE and C18:2-CE were oxidized by ozone, the aldehyde 9-oxononanoyl cholesterol (9-ONC) was formed as a primary product, which was then further oxidized to form 9-oxononanoyl secosterol-A (9-ON-secoA) and 9-oxononanoyl secosterol-B (9-ON-secoB). The compounds 9-ON-secoA and -B, but not 9-ONC, were found to exhibit strong cytotoxicity against human leukemia HL-60 cells. An LC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed for the detection of these cholesteryl ester ozonolysis products by derivatizing them with dansyl hydrazine. Using this method, we found for the first time that low concentrations of 9-ON-secoA and -B, but not palmitoyl secosterols, were present in human LDL. These novel oxidized cholesterol esters, 9-ON-secoA and -B, probably play important roles in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders such as cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The frequency and clinical relevance of SF3B1 mutations have been rarely studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The present study was aimed to analyze the frequency of SF3B1 mutations in AML and CML. DESIGNS AND METHODS: High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was established to detect the mutation hotspots (codon E622, H662, K666, and K700) of SF3B1 gene in 275 AML and 81 CML patients. RESULTS: Heterozygous SF3B1 mutations were detected in three AML patients by HRMA. Direct DNA sequencing identified one K666T, one K666N and one K700E mutations. All three AML patients had normal karyotypes. One case also had NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations, one had FLT3 internal tandem duplication and DNMT3A mutations, and the other had NPM1 mutation. No SF3B1 mutations were detected in CML patients. CONCLUSIONS: SF3B1 mutation is a rare molecular event in Chinese AML and CML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2013 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Feb 5.,"Xestospongin C (XC), which is a group of macrocyclic bis-1-oxaquinolizidines, is a potent inhibitor of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase and IP3 receptor. Nevertheless, very less information is available regarding whether XC induces AML differentiation. We investigated the potential role of XC in the differentiation of human leukemia HL60 cells and mechanisms underlying XC actin. XC treatment inhibited proliferation by inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest in the HL60 cells. In addition, XC induced differentiation of HL60 cells into the CD14(+) monocytic lineage, which was indicated by morphological changes, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, and expressions of CD11b and CD14 surface antigens. Our results also showed that XC promotes phagocytic activity and granularity in HL60 cells, suggesting that the cells are functionally activated. Furthermore, XC enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-mediated cytotoxic effect by increasing the numbers of TNF receptors. Moreover, we showed that XC activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in the differentiation stages. Inhibition of ERK activation using PD98059 significantly decreased NBT+HL60 cells induced by XC treatment. Taken together, the results show that XC promotes monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells via ERK pathway activation, suggesting that XC could be a candidate for use as a differentiation-inducing agent for AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"BACKGROUND: Minimal residual disease (MRD) is the most sensitive and specific predictor of relapse risk in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) during remission. We assessed whether treatment intensity could be adjusted for children and young adults according to MRD risk stratification. METHODS: Between Oct 1, 2003 and June 30, 2011, consecutive children and young adults (aged 1-25 years) with ALL from the UK and Ireland were recruited. Eligible patients were categorised into clinical standard, intermediate, and high risk groups on the basis of a combination of National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria, cytogenetics, and early response to induction therapy, which was assessed by bone marrow blast counts taken at days 8 (NCI high-risk patients) and 15 (NCI standard-risk patients) after induction began. Clinical standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients were assessed for MRD. Those classified as MRD low risk (undetectable MRD at the end of induction [day 29] or detectable MRD at day 29 that became undetectable by week 11) were randomly assigned to receive one or two delayed intensification courses. Patients had received induction, consolidation, and interim maintenance therapy before they began delayed intensification. Delayed intensification consisted of pegylated asparaginase on day 4; vincristine, dexamethasone (alternate weeks), and doxorubicin for 3 weeks; and 4 weeks of cyclophosphamide and cytarabine. Computer randomisation was done with stratification by MRD result and balancing for sex, age, and white blood cell count at diagnosis by method of minimisation. Patients, clinicians, and data analysts were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS), which was defined as time to relapse, secondary tumour, or death. Our aim was to rule out a 7% reduction in EFS in the group given one delayed intensification course relative to that given two delayed intensification courses. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN07355119. FINDINGS: Of 3207 patients registered in the trial overall, 521 MRD low-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive one (n=260) or two (n=261) delayed intensification courses. Median follow-up of these patients was 57 months (IQR 42-72). We recorded no significant difference in EFS between the group given one delayed intensification (94.4% at 5 years, 95% CI 91.1-97.7) and that given two delayed intensifications (95.5%, 92.8-98.2; unadjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.43-2.31; two-sided p=0.99). The difference in 5-year EFS between the two groups was 1.1% (95% CI -5.6 to 2.5). 11 patients (actuarial relapse at 5 years 5.6%, 95% CI 2.3-8.9) given one delayed intensification and six (2.4%, 0.2-4.6) given two delayed intensifications relapsed (p=0.23). Three patients (1.2%, 0-2.6) given two delayed intensifications died of treatment-related causes compared with none in the group given one delayed intensification (p=0.08). We recorded no significant difference between groups for serious adverse events and grade 3 or 4 toxic effects; however, the second delayed intensification course was associated with one (<1%) treatment-related death, and 74 episodes of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects in 45 patients (17%). INTERPRETATION: Treatment reduction is feasible for children and young adults with ALL who are predicted to have a low risk of relapse on the basis of rapid clearance of MRD by the end of induction therapy.

METHODS: Totally 108 AML-CR1 patients undergoing allo-HSCT were randomized into BuCy (busulfan 1.6 mg/kg, q12 hours, -7 ~ -4d; cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg.d, -3 ~ -2d) or BuFlu (busulfan 1.6 mg/kg, q12 hours, -5 ~ -2d; fludarabine 30 mg/m2.d, -6 ~ -2d) group. Hematopoietic engraftment, regimen-related toxicity (RRT), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant related mortality (TRM), and overall survival were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: All patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution except for two patients who died of RRT during conditioning. All patients obtained complete donor chimerism by day +30 post-transplantation. The incidence of total and III-IV RRT were 94.4% and 81.5% (P = 0.038), and 16.7% and 0.0% (P = 0.002), respectively, in BuCy and BuFlu group. With a median follow up of 609 (range, 3-2130) days after transplantation, the 5-year cumulative incidence of TRM were 18.8 +/- 6.9% and 9.9 +/- 6.3% (P = 0.104); the 5-year cumulative incidence of leukemia relapse were 16.5 +/- 5.8% and 16.2 +/- 5.3% (P = 0.943); the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 67.4 +/- 7.6% and 75.3 +/- 7.2% (P = 0.315), and 72.3 +/- 7.5% and 81.9 +/- 7.0% (P = 0.177), respectively in BuCy and BuFlu group. CONCLUSION: Compared with BuCy, BuFlu as a myeloablative condition regimen was associated with lower toxicities and comparable anti-leukemic activity in AML-CR1 patients undergoing allo-HSCT.",,"['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3571894,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"BACKGROUND: Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene overexpression has been reported in the majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients at diagnosis and has been evaluated as prognostic and minimal residual disease (MRD) marker. PATIENTS AND METHODS: WT1 overexpression was evaluated in 68 adult AML patients at diagnosis and at the end of induction using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: No significant associations were encountered between WT1 overexpression at diagnosis and other prognostic factors. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 74% of the patients with WT1 overexpression compared to 80% of patients with normal levels (P = 0.5). No significant associations were encountered between WT1 overexpression at diagnosis and disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) (P = 0.6 and 0.3, respectively). At the end of induction, the median duration of DFS in patients achieving >/= 2 log reduction was not reached compared to only 5 months (range: 2.1-7.9 months) in those attaining <2 log reduction (P = 0.2). The median duration of OS in patients achieving >/= 2 log reduction was 13 months (range: 0-33.3 months) compared to 7.5 months (5.4-9.6 months) in those attaining <2 log reduction (P = 0.2). The survival at 1 year in patients achieving >/= 2 log was double the group with <2 log reduction (67% compared to 33%). CONCLUSION: Our results, although not reaching the level of significance, probably due to the small sample size, still suggest that the early assessment of WT1 transcript level at the end of induction in patients in CR may have a prognostic significance on clinical outcome and may thus be a useful marker for risk stratification especially in patients lacking disease-specific marker.",,"['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. ghadamossallam@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we investigated the roles of promoter hypermethylation of BIM and BID genes and H3K27me3 histone modification on imatinib resistance. We detected higher expression levels of BIM and BID genes and lower expression levels of EZH2, EED2, SIRT1, and SUZ12 genes in imatinib-resistant K562/IMA-3 cells compared to imatinib-non-resistant K562 cells. While we determined the EZH2 and DNMT enzymes as bounded to the promoter of the BIM gene, we did not detect hypermethylation of this promoter. We also found the H3K27me3 histone modification promoter of BIM and BID genes in both cell lines. In conclusion, our results support the notion that DNA promoter methylation may be formed independently from EZH2-H3K27me3 and pro-apoptotic BIM and BID genes are not methyllated in the imatinib resistance of CML cells.",,"['Department of Basic Oncology, Insitute of Oncology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. subozkurt@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 31.,"BACKGROUND: Imatinib has so far been the first-choice treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with excellent results. However, only a proportion of patients achieve major molecular response. Hence, the need to find whether there are some factors that affect the response to treatment is essential. This study aimed to investigate the allele and genotype frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SLCO1B3 (T334G) and CYP3A5*3 in CML patients undergoing imatinib treatment and to determine whether SNPs of these two genes could predict the response of imatinib therapy in CML patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated SLCO1B3 (T334G) and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms by Polymerase Chain Reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 86 Philadelphia positive newly diagnosed Egyptian CML patients (78 patients in chronic phase and 8 patients in accelerated phase). All patients received imatinib therapy and were followed for at least one and half years. The response to imatinib therapy was evaluated by recording the hematological response, cytogenetic response, and molecular response according to the European Leukemia Net criteria. RESULTS: This study included 86 Philadelphia positive newly diagnosed CML patients, 78 in the early chronic phase and 8 in the accelerated phase. In the chronic phase patients, no association between SLCO1B3 (T334G) exon 3 polymorphism and response to imatinib therapy was detected (P = 0.938) while CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism was associated with inferior outcome (P < 0.001). In the group of accelerated phase patients, the SLCO1B3 polymorphic variants (TG) and (GG) were detected equally with none of the patients in this group having the homozygous wild form (TT). The homozygous state for the CYP3A5*3 allele was the most frequent (50%) and the homozygous state for the CYP3A5*1 allele was the least frequent (12.5%) in this group. CONCLUSION: CYP3A5*3 polymorphism was associated with imatinib efficacy while the SNP SLCO1B3 (T334G) was not associated with the response to imatinib treatment in Egyptian patients with CML in chronic phase. These results prompt us to explore the effect of CYP3A5*3 in CML patients taking imatinib in a larger scale study.",,"['Department of Hematology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. dr_ahmed_bedewy@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic importance of the meningioma 1 (MN1) gene expression levels in CN-AML. One hundred patients with CN-AML were diagnosed; MN1 expressions were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. High expressions were detected in 48 (48%) patients (expression range: 2.35-31.99, mean: 13.9 +/- 8.49) in comparison with 52 (52%) patients with low expression (expression range: 0.02-2.3, mean: 0.68 +/- 0.77). The course of the disease in patients with high MN1 expression was unfavorable. Patients with high MN1 expression was associated with significant low complete remission rate (62.5 vs. 8.4%, high vs. low MN1, P = 0.001) and high mortality rate (75% vs. 46.1, P = 0.03). AML patients with high MN1 expression tended to be refractory (37.5 vs. 19.2%, P = 0.00) and relapse risk (54.1 vs. 23%, P = 0.02). Multivariable analysis confirmed high MN1 expression as an independent risk factor for disease-free survival and overall survival. In conclusion, MN1 overexpression independently predicts bad clinical outcome in CN-AML patients.",,"['Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2004, multiple Egyptian centers shifted protocol of therapy of ALL to the CCG 1991 (the single delayed intensification arm) and CCG 1961 protocol for standard risk and high-risk ALL therapy, respectively, being cost effective. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CCG protocol in treatment of childhood ALL in Ain Shams and Menoufeya University hospitals. METHODS: Fifty-two ALL patients, aged 1-17 years, treated according to the modified CCG protocol in both centers and registered from November 2004 to December 2005 were included. They were classified into three risk groups, standard risk (SR), high-risk standard arm (HR-SA), and high-risk augmented arm (HR-AA). RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 5.9 + 3.3 years, male/female ratio of 1.6:1, and central nervous system leukemia represented 6%. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and EFS were 84.6% and 67%, respectively. The 5-year OS and EFS were 92.6% and 70% in SR, 68.8% and 55% in HR-SA, 88.9% and 80% in HR-AA patients, respectively. Six patients had grade 3-4 adverse events. CONCLUSION: The outcome of HR-SA protocol was inferior to the other two groups, necessitating shift to a more intensified arm with double delayed intensification.

METHOD: Patients with imatinib therapy time exceeding 30 days pre-/post-transplant were screened in our data. Imatinib was used in induced or consolidated chemotherapy pre-transplant, or maintenance therapy after 60 days post-transplant (therapy time was less than 180 days) regardless of the molecular status of the disease. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients with Ph+ ALL were enrolled in the retrospective analysis. Forty-four patients received imatinib therapy, including 24 pre-transplant, 9 post-transplant, and 11 both pre- and post-transplant. With a median follow-up time of 395 days (range, 55-2762 days) post-transplant, 3-year estimated overall survival was 62.3 +/- 16.6, 40.0 +/- 21.9, 41.7 +/- 22.2, and 25.9 +/- 11.4%, respectively (P = 0.221), and disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.6 +/- 17.9, 20.0 +/- 17.9, 33.3 +/- 25.5% and 23.6 +/- 11.4%, respectively (P = 0.421), in patients with imatinib therapy pre-transplant, post-transplant, both pre- and post-transplant, neither pre- nor post-transplant. The incidence of relapse at 3 year for patients with imatinib therapy post-transplant (n = 20) was 63.6%, comparing with 24.2% (P = 0.018) in patients without imatinib therapy post-transplant (n = 49). The ratio of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in blood was significantly higher at 30 and 60 days after imatinib therapy than that at the time of pre-imatinib in 20 patients (P = 0.019 and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Application of imatinib pre-transplant might have benefited for patients with Ph+ ALL.

The method was developed in our laboratory in the course of studies based on the use of growth factorsupplemented liquid cultures to study haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell resistance to, and selection at, low oxygen tensions in the incubation atmosphere. These studies led us to put forward the first hypothesis of the existence in vivo of haematopoietic stem cell niches where oxygen tension is physiologically lower than in other bone marrow areas. The CRA assays and incubation in low oxygen were later adapted to the study of leukaemias. Stabilized leukaemia cell lines, ensuring genetically homogeneous cells and enhancing repeatability of results, were found nevertheless phenotypically heterogeneous, comprising cell subsets exhibiting functional phenotypes of stem or progenitor cells. These subsets can be assayed separately, provided an experimental system capable to select one from another (such as different criteria for incubation in low oxygen) is established. On this basis, a two-step procedure was designed, including a primary culture of leukaemia cells in low oxygen for different times, where drug treatment is applied, followed by the transfer of residual cell population (CRA assay) to a drug-free secondary culture incubated at standard oxygen tension, where the expansion of population is allowed. The CRA assays, applied to cell lines first and then to primary cells, represent a simple and relatively rapid, yet accurate and reliable, method for the pre-screening of drugs potentially active on leukaemias which in our opinion could be adopted systematically before they are tested in vivo.",,"[""Dipartimento di Patologia e Oncologia Sperimentali dell'Universita degli Studi di Firenze e Istituto Toscano Tumori, viale G.B.

MDSs are predominant in the elderly with an incidence of 20/100000 at 70 years of age. To date, the only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, a majority of patients are not eligible for this therapy. Azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, remains the primary treatment for MDS patients, which leads to a significant increase in overall survival (OS), although it is not curative. Although it is well known that the impairment of apoptosis and differentiation are important features of this complex disease, the implication of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MDS is an emerging concept. Another significant advance in MDS pathogenesis research is the recent identification of mutations in genes encoding transcription factors implicated in hematopoiesis and proteins involved in splicing (SF3B1), methylation (DNMT3A), regulation of methylation (TET2 and IDH), DNA conformation (EZH2 and ASXL1) and differentiation (N- and K-RAS). Additionally, BCL2 family member expression and regulation may also affect the physiopathology of this disease. We have recently reported that targeting autophagy may be an interesting option for the treatment of AZA-resistant patients. Thus, targeting the products of the above-mentioned genes or the signaling pathways affected by the corresponding proteins may be of great interest for the development of a new arsenal of molecules to fight MDS. In this review, we discuss the new aspects of MDS physiopathology and how recent advances in MDS pathogenesis research may impact future treatments to improve the outcome of MDS patients.",,"['INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Team Cell Death, Differentiation, Inflammation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has resulted in the classification of ELF-EMF into category 2B, ie, agents that are ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Since melatonin, a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland, has been shown to possess oncostatic properties, a ""melatonin hypothesis"" has been raised, stating that exposure to EMF might decrease melatonin production and therefore might promote the development of breast cancer in humans.

In addition, we have demonstrated a lack of effect of ELF-EMF on melatonin secretion in humans exposed to EMF (up to 20 years' exposure) which rebuts the melatonin hypothesis. Currently, the debate concerns the effects of ELF-EMF on the risk of childhood leukemia in children chronically exposed to more than 0.4 muT. Further research is thus needed to obtain more definite answers regarding the potential deleterious effects of ELF-EMF.",,"['Chronobiology Unit, Foundation A. de Rothschild, Paris, France. yvan.touitou@chronobiology.fr']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chronodisruption', 'circadian rhythm', 'cortisol', 'environment', 'magnetic field', 'marker rhythm', 'melatonin', 'neurobehavioral disturbances', 'rhythm desynchronization']",,PMC3553569,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anoikis-sensitizing effect of ecteinascidin 770 (ET-770) was investigated in the present study in non-small cell lung cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ET-770 isolated from Ecteinascidia thurstoni was tested for its anoikis-sensitizing effect on H23 and H460 human lung cancer cells by 2,3-b-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide salt (XTT) assay. The levels of proteins being involved in anoikis of cells were determined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: ET-770 was shown to enhance anoikis response of human lung cancer H23 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The underlying mechanism was investigated and it was found that ET-770 sensitized the cells by activating the p53 protein, which in turn down-regulated anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1) and up-regulated BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) proteins. However, B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) proteins were not significantly affected by ET-770. Further, the anoikis sensitization of ET-770 was observed in H460 lung cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The present results reveal for the first time that ET-770 can sensitize anoikis through the p53 pathway and further development of this compound for therapeutic use is warranted.",,"['Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulakongkorn University, Phatumwan, Bangkok, 10330 Thailand. pithi_chan@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"Although most children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) achieve complete remission, the relapse rate is 30% to 40%. Because it is thought that leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) are responsible for AML relapses, targeting these cells might improve outcome. Treatment of pediatric AML blasts with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor PTK787/ZK 222584 (PTK/ZK) induces cell death in vitro. However, the role of PTK/ZK inhibition on outgrowth of (pediatric) LICs is unknown. In this study, we cultured CD34+ cells from pediatric patients with AML on MS5 stromal cells in long-term cocultures. In analogy to adult AML, long-term expansion of leukemic cells up to 10 weeks could be generated in 9 of 13 pediatric AMLs. Addition of PTK/ZK to long-term cocultures significantly inhibited leukemic expansion in all samples, ranging from 4% to 80% growth inhibition at week 5 compared with untreated samples. In 75% of the samples, the inhibitory effect was more pronounced at week 10. Proteome profiler array analysis of downstream kinases revealed that PTK/ZK reduced activation of PI3K/Akt kinase signaling. Although main targets of PTK/ZK are VEGF receptors (VEGFR), no effect was seen on outgrowth of LICs when cultured with bevacizumab (monoclonal VEGFA-antibody), specific antibodies against VEGFR2 or VEGFR3, or exposed to stroma-derived VEGFA. These data suggest that the effect of PTK/ZK on LICs is not only dependent on inhibition of VEGFA/VEGFR signaling. Taken together, our data elucidated antileukemic properties of PTK/ZK in long-term expansion cultures, and suggest that targeting multiple RTKs by PTK/ZK might be a potential effective approach in eradicating (pediatric) LICs.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB Groningen, the Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a mechanism by which MEF/ELF4 may be activated by a common leukemia-associated mutation in the nucleophosmin gene. By using a tandem affinity purification assay, we found that MEF/ELF4 interacts with multifactorial protein nucleophosmin (NPM1). Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments demonstrated that MEF/ELF4 directly forms a complex with NPM1 and also identified the region of NPM1 that is responsible for this interaction. Functional analyses showed that wild-type NPM1 inhibited the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of MEF/ELF4 on the HDM2 promoter, whereas NPM1 mutant protein (Mt-NPM1) enhanced these activities of MEF/ELF4. Induction of Mt-NPM1 into MEF/ELF4-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells facilitated malignant transformation. In addition, clinical leukemia samples with NPM1 mutations had higher human MDM2 (HDM2) mRNA expression.

Elucidation of the role of IDH mutations and (R)-2HG in leukemogenesis has been hampered by a lack of appropriate cell-based models. Here, we show that a canonical IDH1 mutant, IDH1 R132H, promotes cytokine independence and blocks differentiation in hematopoietic cells. These effects can be recapitulated by (R)-2HG, but not (S)-2HG, despite the fact that (S)-2HG more potently inhibits enzymes, such as the 5'-methylcytosine hydroxylase TET2, that have previously been linked to the pathogenesis of IDH mutant tumors.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"Survival in infants younger than 1 year who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is inferior whether MLL is rearranged (R) or germline (G). MLL translocations confer chemotherapy resistance, and infants experience excess complications. We characterized in vitro sensitivity to the pan-antiapoptotic BCL-2 family inhibitor obatoclax mesylate in diagnostic leukemia cells from 54 infants with ALL/bilineal acute leukemia because of the role of prosurvival BCL-2 proteins in resistance, their imbalanced expression in infant ALL, and evidence of obatoclax activity with a favorable toxicity profile in early adult leukemia trials. Overall, half maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) were lower than 176 nM (the maximal plasma concentration [Cmax] with recommended adult dose) in 76% of samples, whether in MLL-AF4, MLL-ENL, or other MLL-R or MLL-G subsets, and regardless of patients' poor prognostic features. However, MLL status and partner genes correlated with EC50. Combined approaches including flow cytometry, Western blot, obatoclax treatment with death pathway inhibition, microarray analyses, and/or electron microscopy indicated a unique killing mechanism involving apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in MLL-AF4 ALL cell lines and primary MLL-R and MLL-G infant ALL cells. This in vitro obatoclax activity and its multiple killing mechanisms across molecular cytogenetic subsets provide a rationale to incorporate a similarly acting compound into combination strategies to combat infant ALL.",,"[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",,,,,,,"['R25 CA101871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08HL084199/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25CA101871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL084199/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL114697/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3617634,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00933985'],,,,,,,,

The presently available treatment options in PV are discussed and recommendations for the clinical management are given.The JAK2V617F mutation, a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase gene JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2), has emerged as a central feature in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Subsequently, the identification of several other mutated genes in MPN has shown that the pathogenesis is complex and that the JAK2V617F mutation is a critical, but not the only step leading to the uncontrolled proliferation in MPN including PV.The diagnostic criteria of PV have been revised in 2008 and include the JAK2V617F mutation as one of the two major criteria of the disease. This molecular diagnostic marker proves the clonality and facilitates the diagnosis of early and uncertain cases which remained sometimes undiagnosed in the past.Main treatment aims are the reduction of thromboembolic events and the minimization of the risk of myelofibrosis and of acute leukemia. PV patients with low risk of vascular complications should be treated with phlebotomy and low dose acetylsalicylic acid. High risk patients should receive cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon alpha. Studies with JAK inhibitors are presently ongoing.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Such a risk is likely influenced by histological and treatment differences between CNS tumors. De-identified data for 41,159 patients with a primary CNS tumor diagnosis from 9 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries were used to calculate potential risk for subsequent cancer development. Relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) of subsequent cancer was calculated using SEER*Stat 7.0.9, comparing observed number of subsequent cancers versus expected in the general United States population. For all CNS tumors studied, there were 830 subsequent cancers with a RR of 1.26 (95 % CI, 1.18-1.35). Subsequent cancers were observed in the CNS, digestive system, bones/joints, soft tissue, thyroid and leukemia. Radiotherapy was associated with an elevated risk, particularly in patients diagnosed with a medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MPNET). MPNET patients who received radiotherapy were at a significant risk for development of cancers of the digestive system, leukemia, bone/joint and cranial nerves. Glioblastoma multiforme patients who received radiotherapy were at lower risks for female breast and prostate cancers, though at an elevated risk for cancers of the thyroid and brain. Radiotherapy is associated with subsequent cancer development, particularly for sites within the field of radiation, though host susceptibility and post-treatment status underlie this risk. Variation in subsequent cancer risk among different CNS tumor histological subtypes indicate a complex interplay between risk factors in subsequent cancer development.",,"['Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.

However, the relationship between molecular CML28 and WT1 has not been reported. Here we described the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against WT1 and CML28 in leukemic cell line K562 to examine the interaction between CML28 and WT1. WT1 and CML28 gene expression in transfected K562 cells was detected by using RQ-PCR and Western blotting. K562 cells transfected with WT1-siRNA could greatly decrease both mRNA and protein expression levels of WT1 and CML28. In contrast, CML28-siRNA did not exert effect on WT1. Further, subcellular co-localization assay showed that the two proteins could co-localize in the cytoplasm of K562 cells, but WT1/CML28 complexes were not detected by using immunoprecipitation. It was suggested that there exists the relationship between CML28 and WT1.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"Multispecific antibody-like molecules have the potential to advance the standard-of-care in many human diseases. The design of therapeutic molecules in this class, however, has proven to be difficult and, despite significant successes in preclinical research, only one trivalent antibody, catumaxomab, has demonstrated clinical utility. The challenge originates from the complexity of the design space where multiple parameters such as affinity, avidity, effector functions, and pharmaceutical properties need to be engineered in concurrent fashion to achieve the desired therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a rapid prototyping approach that allows us to successfully optimize these parameters within one campaign cycle that includes modular design, yeast display of structure focused antibody libraries and high throughput biophysical profiling. We delineate this approach by presenting a design case study of MM-141, a tetravalent bispecific antibody targeting two compensatory signaling growth factor receptors: insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ErbB3). A MM-141 proof-of-concept (POC) parent molecule did not meet initial design criteria due to modest bioactivity and poor stability properties. Using a combination of yeast display, structured-guided antibody design and library-scale thermal challenge assay, we discovered a diverse set of stable and active anti-IGF-1R and anti-ErbB3 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs).

Sorafenib activated autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the HCC cell lines PLC5, Sk-Hep1, HepG2 and Hep3B. Sorafenib downregulated phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3) and subsequently reduced the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Inhibition of Mcl-1 by sorafenib resulted in disruption of the Beclin 1-Mcl-1 complex; however, sorafenib did not affect the amount of Beclin 1, suggesting that sorafenib treatment released Beclin 1 from binding with Mcl-1. Silencing of SHP-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) reduced the effect of sorafenib on P-STAT3 and autophagy. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 abolished the effect of sorafenib on autophagy. Knockdown of Beclin 1 by siRNA protected the cells from sorafenib-induced autophagy. Moreover, SC-59, a sorafenib derivative, had a more potent effect on cancer cell viability than sorafenib. SC-59 downregulated P-STAT3 and induced autophagy in all tested HCC cell lines. Furthermore, our in vivo data showed that both sorafenib and SC-59 inhibited tumor growth, downregulated P-STAT3, enhanced the activity of SHP-1 and induced autophagy in PLC5 tumors, suggesting that sorafenib and SC-59 activate autophagy in HCC.

However, the detailed mechanism by which sodium selenite specifically kills tumor cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that supranutritional doses of selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent modulation of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a signaling pathway. First, we found that selenite treatment in HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells caused inhibition of AKT and the nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, respectively, thereby facilitating transcription of the target genes bim and PTEN. Modulation of the AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway by chemical inhibitors or RNA interference revealed that these events were critical for selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Additionally, we discovered that FoxO3a-mediated upregulation of PTEN exerted a further inhibitory effect on the AKT survival pathway. We also corroborated our findings in vivo by performing immunohistochemistry experiments. In summary, our results show that selenite could induce ROS-dependent FoxO3a-mediated apoptosis in CRC cells and xenograft tumors through PTEN-mediated inhibition of the PI3K/AKT survival axis. These results help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying selenite-induced cell death in tumor cells and provide a theoretical basis for translational applications of selenium.",,"['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100005, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3734838,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The JAK2 V617F mutation has been detected in patients with classical myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. In contrast, this same mutation has been detected in only 4 patients with CNL to date, suggesting that the JAK2 V617F mutation is a rare event in patients with atypical MPD. Here, we report a case of CNL with presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation.

METHODS: Multivariate analysis in 649 patients followed for a median of 19 months (range, 1-180 months). RESULTS: We identified age > 60 (P = .004; hazard ratio [HR], 1.63), platelets <100 x 10(9)/L (P < .001; HR, 1.62), bone marrow blast > 10% (P = .002; HR, 2.18), high-risk karyotype (P < .001; HR, 2.44), transfusion dependency (P < .001; HR, 2.64), performance status > 1 (P = .003; HR, 1.47), lactate dehydrogenase > 2000 U/L (P < .001; HR, 1.62), previous hydroxyurea (P < .001; HR, 1.69), and male sex (P = .005; HR, 1.41) as independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Using the same baseline variables we identified bone marrow blasts >10% and worst karyotype as independent risk factors for AML transformation. Patients with 1 or both of these risk factors (n = 80; 12%) had a median survival of 10 months and a 1-year AML transformation rate of 13% (2% if none of those factors, P = .001).

Although each has distinct pathologic features, all 3 display alterations in Janus kinase (JAK) signal transduction activator of transcription signaling. Myelofibrosis is the most serious of the 3, associated with shortened survival (median survival, 5-7 years); bone marrow failure with anemia; progressive splenomegaly; and chronic, burdensome symptoms, including fatigue, night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite/early satiety, unintentional weight loss, and bone, chest, and abdominal pain. Treatments for MF have been mainly palliative, with the exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which, although potentially curative, is feasible only in a small subpopulation of patients. In November 2011, ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of intermediate- or high-risk MF, including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-ET MF. In clinical trials, ruxolitinib was shown to reduce spleen volume and improve MF-related symptoms and quality-of-life measures. Evidence also suggests that ruxolitinib therapy has a survival advantage over placebo and best available therapy. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most common adverse events with treatment.

Epub 2013 Mar 15.,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces clinical remission in most acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients by inducing terminal differentiation of APL cells toward mature granulocytes. Here we report that human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are capable of inducing granulocytic differentiation of the APL-derived NB4 cell line as well as primary APL cells and also cooperate with ATRA in an additive manner. Transwell coculture experiments revealed that UC-MSCs' differentiation-inducing effect was mediated through some soluble factors. Differentiation attenuation by IL-6Ra neutralization and induction by addition of exogenous IL-6 confirmed that IL-6 secreted by UC-MSCs was at least partially responsible for this differentiation induction process. Moreover, we found that UC-MSCs activated the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in promyelocytic cells and pharmacological inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway reversed UC-MSC-induced differentiation, indicating that UC-MSCs exerted effect through activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. These results demonstrate for the first time a stimulatory effect of MSCs on the differentiation of APL cells and bring a new insight into the interaction between MSCs and leukemic cells. Our data suggest that UC-MSCs/ATRA combination could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy for APL patients.",,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Engineering Research Center of Stem Cells, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3685326,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circulating miRNAs are emerging biomarkers in many diseases and cancers such as type 2 diabetes, pulmonary disease, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer among others; however, defining a plasma miRNA signature in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) that could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis or in the follow-up has not been done yet. METHODS: TaqMan miRNA microarray was performed to identify deregulated miRNAs in the plasma of AML patients. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to validate the results. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the highly and significantly identified deregulated miRNA(s) as potential candidate biomarker(s). RESULTS: The plasma expression level of let-7d, miR-150, miR-339, and miR-342 was down-regulated whilst that of let-7b, and miR-523 was up-regulated in the AML group at diagnosis compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC (the areas under the ROC curve) of 0.835 (95% CI: 0.7119- 0.9581; P<0.0001) and 0.8125 (95% CI: 0.6796-0.9454; P=0.0005) for miR-150, and miR-342 respectively. Combined ROC analyses using these 2 miRNAs revealed an elevated AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.7819-0.94; P<0.0001) indicating the additive effect in the diagnostic value of these 2 miRNAs. QRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of these two miRs in complete remission AML patients resembled that of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that plasma miR-150 and miR-342 are novel important promising biomarkers in the diagnosis of AML. These novel and promising markers warrant validation in larger prospective studies.",,"['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 121, Boulevard de Waterloo, Bruxelles 1000, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,PMC3579719,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"UNLABELLED: Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after laser irradiation in various types of cells. BACKGROUND DATA: ROS are considered to be the key secondary messengers produced by low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Although various mechanisms for the effects of LLLT have been proposed, and intracellular ROS were indicated as the one of the key factors, direct measurement of intracellular ROS of several types of cells after different wavelength lasers irradiation has not been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various types of cells were used in this study: mouse preadipocytes (3T3-L1), prechondrocytes (ATDC5), myoblasts (C2C12), mesenchymal stromal cells (KUSA-A1), lung cancer cells (LLC), insulinoma cells (MIN6), fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), human cervix adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), macrophages differentiated from lymphocytes (THP-1) after treatment with phorbol ester, and rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Cells were irradiated with a blue laser (wavelength: 405 nm), a red laser (wavelength: 664 nm) or a near infrared laser (wavelength: 808 nm) at 100 mW/cm(2) for 60 or 120 sec. Intracellular ROS levels were measured by fluorometric assay using the intracellular ROS probe, CM-H2DCFDA in a flow cytometer. RESULTS: After a blue laser irradiation, intracellular ROS levels were increased in all types of cells. In contrast, intracellular ROS generation was not observed after irradiation with a red laser or near-infrared laser. CONCLUSIONS: Potential sources of intracellular ROS were excited by blue laser irradiation, resulting in ROS production within cells. Although the low-level intracellular ROS should be generated after a red or a near-infrared laser irradiation, the only high level intracellular ROS were detected by the ROS probe used in this study. As ROS are considered to be key secondary messengers, the specific functional regulation of cells by laser irradiation will be studied in a future study.",,"['Department of Medical Engineering, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan. toshi@ndmc.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 21.,"Cladribine (2-CDA) is a well-known purine nucleoside analog with activities against lymphoproliferative disorders such as hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Bendamustine, a hybrid molecule of purine analog and alkylator, induces apoptosis via DNA damage response and inhibition of mitotic checkpoint. Their therapeutic potential in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), particularly those become resistant to traditional chemotherapeutic agents, remains unclear. Here we study the effects of cladribine or bendamustine on dexamethasone-sensitive (MM1.S) and -resistant (MM1.R) MM cells. MTS-based proliferation assays showed that cladribine and bendamustine exhibited similar anti-proliferation/anti-survival effects on MM1.S and MM1.R cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50s of cladribine were approximately 35.3 nmol/L and 58 nmol/L for MM1.S and MM1.R cells, respectively. The IC50s of bendamustine were approximately 119.8 mumol/L (MM1.S) and 138 mumol/L (MM1.R). An apoptotic-ELISA and western blot assays of PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 indicated that cladribine or bendamustine induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Similar results were obtained with flow cytometric analysis showing that cladribine or bendamustine increased the sub-G1 population. Treatment with bendamustine but not cladribine also resulted in cell cycle S-phase arrest. Either cladribine or bendamustine led to a remarkable increase of the phosphorylated H2A.X, CHK1 and CHK2 in both MM1.S and MM1.R cells, suggesting an induction of DNA damage response. Collectively, we demonstrate that cladribine and bendamustine exert potent inhibitory effects on dexamethasone-sensitive and -resistant MM cells in vitro. Our data suggest that MM patients, including those with dexamethasone resistance, may particularly benefit from cladribine or bendamustine.",,"['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital Beijing, China ; Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora, CO, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cladribine', 'DNA damage response', 'apoptosis', 'bendamustine', 'dexamethasone resistance', 'multiple myeloma']",,PMC3560475,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The histone acetyltransferase p300 promotes self-renewal of leukemia cells by acetylating AE and facilitating its downstream gene expression as a transcriptional coactivator, suggesting that p300 may be a potential therapeutic target for AE-positive AML. However, the effects of p300 inhibitors on leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms have not been extensively investigated. In the current study, we analyzed the anti-leukemia effects of C646, a selective and competitive p300 inhibitor, on AML cells. Results showed that C646 inhibited cellular proliferation, reduced colony formation, evoked partial cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, and induced apoptosis in AE-positive AML cell lines and primary blasts isolated from leukemic mice and AML patients. Nevertheless, no significant inhibitory effects were observed in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized normal peripheral blood stem cells. Notably, AE-positive AML cells were more sensitive to lower C646 doses than AE-negative ones. And C646-induced growth inhibition on AE-positive AML cells was associated with reduced global histone H3 acetylation and declined c-kit and bcl-2 levels. Therefore, C646 may be a potential candidate for treating AE-positive AML.",,"['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3563640,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 6.,"Leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16) was first cloned from acute myeloid leukemia cells in our laboratory. In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of LRP16 in insulin action and sensitivity, using LRP16-depleted and -overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells. LRP16 silencing resulted in a reduction of the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and a concomitant increase in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). Moreover, LRP16 depletion promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake and adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast, LRP16 overexpression increased TNF-alpha secretion, suppressed glucose uptake, and attenuated 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. The phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), and Akt were increased in LRP16-deficient 3T3-L1 cells, and conversely, diminished in LRP16-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells, when compared to the corresponding control cells. Additionally, LRP16 overexpression raised the phosphorylation level of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The pretreatment with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, prevented the TNF-alpha elevation and PPAR-gamma reduction and restored the phosphorylation of IRS-1, PI3-K, and Akt in LRP16-overexpressing cells. Our data collectively indicate that LRP16 acts as a negative regulator of insulin action and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which involves the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Our main result is to demonstrate that some of the most frequently used gene set methods, GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE, are severely influenced by the filtering of the data in a way that such an analysis is no longer reconcilable with the principles of statistical inference, rendering the obtained results in the worst case inexpressive. A possible consequence of this is that these methods can increase their power by the addition of unrelated data and noise. Our results are obtained within a bootstrapping framework that allows a rigorous assessment of the robustness of results and enables power estimates. Our results indicate that when using competitive gene set methods, it is imperative to apply a stringent gene filtering criterion. However, even when genes are filtered appropriately, for gene expression data from chips that do not provide a genome-scale coverage of the expression values of all mRNAs, this is not enough for GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE to ensure the statistical soundness of the applied procedure. For this reason, for biomedical and clinical studies, we strongly advice not to use GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE for such data sets.",,"[""Computational Biology and Machine Learning Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7BL, UK.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3627569,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to determine the long-term neurocognitive outcomes in childhood cancer survivors who had CVST during therapy. Nine patients were identified from an institutional database. All had experienced CVST in the setting of L-asparaginase therapy in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Four patients completed neuropsychological evaluation. Their neurological examinations were normal. Neuropsychological testing showed that the participants performed well, with average to above-average scores on cognitive and behavioral testing. Three exhibited difficulties on a visual-motor integration task and 1 had difficulty with fine-motor dexterity, nonverbal memory, emotional control, shifting attention, and anxiety. Overall, by patient and parent report, the survivors had few problems. CVST is a known complication associated with treatment for leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, most commonly observed if asparaginase is used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Although subtle difficulties were noted in survivors on neuropsychological testing, survivors themselves were not aware of the deficits. Further evaluation of leukemia survivors with a history of CVST is needed to assess for deficits and to understand whether further intervention is necessary.",,"['Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed somatic mutation of BAX and BAK genes in 47 gastric, 47 colorectal, 47 breast, 47 lung and 47 prostate carcinomas, and 47 acute leukemias by a polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. RESULTS: We identified BAX gene mutations in one colon (2.1%) and three gastric (6.4%) cancers. All of the mutations were frameshift mutations in the G8 repeat sequences and were detected in cancers with high microsatellite instability (36.4%). There was no evidence of BAX mutation in the other cancers, nor was somatic mutation of the BAK gene detected in the cancers.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"BACKGROUND: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergo multiple lumbar punctures (LPs) during their course of treatment for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. LP is a stressful and painful procedure, affecting the quality of life of these children. Procedural analgo-sedation might improve the child's comfort and prevent the child's movements, reducing the risk of traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts (TLP+), mainly at diagnosis, when higher numbers of blast cells are circulating in the peripheral blood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of procedural analgo-sedation in children with ALL. METHODS: From September 2006 to November 2008, we performed a total of 252 lumbar punctures under deep sedation with propofol and ketamine in 25 children with ALL treated at our division. During the procedures, vital parameters were monitored and side effects were recorded. The efficacy of deep sedation was evaluated using Ramsay and Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain scales. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for chemical and cytological examinations. RESULTS: In all patients a satisfactory sedation and analgesia were achieved. The evaluation of vital parameters did not show any significant variation compared to baseline values. No side effects were recorded. Only 3 (1.2 %) of 252 lumbar punctures resulted in traumatic effects. CONCLUSION: To strongly improve comfort and quality of life of children with ALL and reduce the risk of TLP+ mainly at diagnosis, we recommend performing the lumbar punctures under analgo-sedation because it is a safe and effective procedure.",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, ""A.

The expression profile of histone-modifying genes was significantly different between normal karyotype B cell pediatric ALL and normal controls. Eleven genes were upregulated in pediatric ALL, including the histone deacetylases HDAC2 and PAK1, and seven genes were downregulated, including PRMT2 and the putative tumor suppressor EP300. Future studies will seek to determine whether these genes serve as biomarkers of pediatric ALL. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that Gene Expression and Organ Morphology was the highest rated network, with 13 focus molecules (significance score = 35). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis also indicated that curcumin and miR-34 are upstream regulators of histone-modifying enzymes; future studies will seek to validate these results and examine the role of curcumin and miR-34 in leukemia.

Epub 2013 Feb 6.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of disorders characterized by variable cytopenias and ineffective hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors in MDS have not been extensively characterized. We transplanted purified human HSCs from MDS samples into immunodeficient mice and show that HSCs are the disease-initiating cells in MDS. We identify a recurrent loss of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) in the bone marrow of low risk MDS patients that can distinguish low risk MDS from clinical mimics, thus providing a simple diagnostic tool. The loss of GMPs is likely due to increased apoptosis and increased phagocytosis, the latter due to the up-regulation of cell surface calreticulin, a prophagocytic marker. Blocking calreticulin on low risk MDS myeloid progenitors rescues them from phagocytosis in vitro. However, in the high-risk refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) stages of MDS, the GMP population is increased in frequency compared with normal, and myeloid progenitors evade phagocytosis due to up-regulation of CD47, an antiphagocytic marker. Blocking CD47 leads to the selective phagocytosis of this population. We propose that MDS HSCs compete with normal HSCs in the patients by increasing their frequency at the expense of normal hematopoiesis, that the loss of MDS myeloid progenitors by programmed cell death and programmed cell removal are, in part, responsible for the cytopenias, and that up-regulation of the ""don't eat me"" signal CD47 on MDS myeloid progenitors is an important transition step leading from low risk MDS to high risk MDS and, possibly, to acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research and Medicine, and Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. wendy.pang@stanford.edu']",,,,,,,"['R01AG029124/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA1295470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA86065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA129547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA139490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA139490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG029124/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3581956,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease (MRD) status has been proven to be a strong prognostic factor for adult patients with Ph-negative ALL. METHODS: We investigated whether MRD status in adult patients with ALL is useful to decide clinical indications for allogeneic HSCT. We prospectively monitored MRD after induction and consolidation therapy in adult patients with Ph-negative ALL. RESULTS: Of 110 adult ALL patients enrolled between July 2002 and August 2008, 101 were eligible, including 59 Ph-negative patients. MRD status was assessed in 43 patients by the detection of major rearrangements in TCR and Ig and the presence of chimeric mRNA. Thirty-nine patients achieved CR1, and their probabilities of 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were 74% and 56%, respectively. Patients who were MRD-negative after induction therapy (n = 26) had a significantly better 3-year DFS compared with those who were MRD-positive (n = 13; 69% vs. 31%, p = 0.004). All of 3 patients who were MRD-positive following consolidation chemotherapy and did not undergo allogeneic HSCT, relapsed and died within 3 years after CR. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that MRD monitoring is useful for determining the clinical indications for allogeneic HSCT in the treatment of ALL in CR1.",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume 830-0011, Japan. knagafuji@med.kurume-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,PMC3574830,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, modification of treatment protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia have led to incremental but steady improvements in long-term overall survival to nearly 90% using combinations of upwards of six drugs. For most cancers, however, including pre-BRAF-inhibitor-era melanoma, combinations of existing cytotoxic agents have not been nearly so successful, resulting mainly in increases in toxicities without added survival benefit. While results with genotype-directed small molecules as single agents can be dramatic, such as 60-80% response rates in ALK-translocated NSCLC or BRAF mutant melanoma, few patients demonstrate complete responses and most experience relapses in less than a year. Because multiple signaling pathways can induce both primary and acquired resistance, the field is now focused on identifying combinations of these less toxic targeted drugs.

Epub 2013 Feb 7.,"Inhibitors of PI3-K/Akt are currently being assessed clinically in patients with advanced RCC. Identification of therapeutic strategies that might enhance the efficacy of PI3-K/Akt inhibitors is therefore of great interest. As PI3-K inhibition would be expected to have many pro-apoptotic effects, we hypothesized that there may be unique synergy between PI3-K inhibitors and BH3-mimetics. Towards this end, we assessed the combination of the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 and the Bcl-2 family inhibitor ABT-737 in RCC cell lines. We found that the combinatorial treatment with these agents led to a significant increase in PARP cleavage and cell death in all RCC cell lines. The synergized cell death was correlated with decreased levels of Mcl-1 and XIAP, and increased levels in Bim, and appears critically dependent upon the activation of caspase 3 and 8. The enhanced lethality observed with the combination also appears dependent upon the regulation of XIAP, Mcl-1 and Bim levels. Our results suggest that the combination of PI3-K inhibitors with BH3-mimetics may be a viable therapeutic strategy in RCC.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Based on this finding and other studies, cancer immunotherapy using gammadelta T cells and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates has been studied in pilot clinical trials and has shown benefits. Although Zol treatment can render a wide variety of human tumor cells susceptible to gammadelta T cell killing, there has not been a systematic investigation to determine which types of tumor cells are the most susceptible to gammadelta T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this study, we determined the Zol concentrations required to stimulate half maximal tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by gammadelta T cells cultured with various tumor cell lines pretreated with Zol and compared these concentrations with those required for half maximal inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) in the same tumor cell lines. The inhibition of tumor cell growth by Zol was also assessed. We found that FPPS inhibition strongly correlated with gammadelta T cell activation, confirming that the mechanism underlying gammadelta T cell activation by Zol is isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) accumulation due to FPPS blockade. In addition, we showed that gammadelta T-cell receptor-mediated signaling correlated with gammadelta T cell tumor necrosis factor-alpha production and cytotoxicity.

Recent studies have provided novel insights into the mechanisms by which NK cells mediate these highly clinically relevant immunological functions. In particular, the ability of NK cells to reduce the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and increase the graft versus leukemia effect (GVL) in the setting of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical HSCT highlights their clinical potentials. NK cells also mediate anti-viral protection, in particular against cytomegalovirus (CMV), an infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality following transplant. Another crucial function of NK cells is providing protection against bacterial infections at the mucosal barriers. NK cells achieve this by promoting anti-microbial defenses and regeneration of epithelial cells. These recent exciting findings provide a strong basis for the formulation of novel NK cell-based immunotherapies. In this review, we summarize the recent advances related to the mechanisms, functions, and future clinical prospects of NK cells that can impact post-transplant outcomes.",,"['1.

This is based on the molecular findings at diagnosis, mainly the presence of internal tandem duplication in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene(s) (FLT3/ITD). Optimal postremission therapy for these high-risk molecular cases is not well established; as the prognosis is adverse hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), mainly allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT), is the most widely accepted strategy. RECENT FINDINGS: As a rule, patients with FLT3/ITD have a poor outcome with conventional chemotherapy alone. Only patients with an associated nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation and those with a low mutated-to-wild-type allelic ratio of FLT3/ITD have less unfavorable outcome. Most studies show an advantage of allo-HCT in first complete remission (CR1), with higher 3-5 year disease-free survival and lower relapse risk than with chemotherapy or autologous transplantation (auto-HCT). Regarding allo-HCT proceeding early after reaching CR1 seems to improve survival, rather than after several courses of consolidation chemotherapy.

We will discuss the challenges of using blood and marrow transplant strategies in this population, as well as the potential impact that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has on HIV-1 reservoirs and persistence. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in stem cell transplantation and the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have made it possible to extend curative cancer therapy to HIV-1-infected individuals with aggressive lymphoma and leukemia. Outcomes of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in HIV-1-infected individuals are similar to the general population. In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), there are a growing number of successful case reports and the first national trial is ongoing. Infectious complications do not appear to be increased in patients on effective ART; however, drug interactions and drug interruptions are common. There is also renewed interest in the possibility that alloHSCT could lead to HIV-1 cure.

B1 (-/-) mice display improvement on leptin and insulin sensitivity and is protected from high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Here, we evaluate the hepatic effects of the B1R ablation and its role on hepatic function. Despite no expression of hepatic B1R, HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was lower than in control animals. B1 (-/-) mice also presented lower hepatic lipogenesis and SCD1 protein content in the liver. When stimulated with exogenous leptin, B1 (-/-) mice exhibited increased hepatic pJAK2. Similarly, leptin signaling was enhanced in the liver of ob/ob-B1 (-/-) mice, as demonstrated by increased levels of pSTAT3 compared to ob/ob. Plasma concentrations of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, fetuin A, leukemia inhibitory factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1, resistin, and oncostatin M were reduced in B1 (-/-). Finally, B1 (-/-) mice have increased gene expression of hepatic B2 receptor, but no difference in leptin receptor expression. Our results show that B1 (-/-) mice are protected from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) after HFD treatment. Since B1R expression was not observed in the liver after HFD, we propose that the cross talk between the adipose tissue and the liver, mainly through leptin, is an important factor contributing to the observed results. Besides that, several other inflammatory mediators already correlated with NAFLD or liver function were found to be altered in our model. Taken together, our data suggest that B1R plays an important role in hepatic steatosis development.",,"['Department of Biophysics, Federal University of Sao Paulo-UNIFESP/EPM, Rua Pedro de Toledo, 669, 9 degrees andar, Vila Clementino, 04039-032 Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advancements in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing and supportive care have improved the risk-benefit ratio for SCT, expanding its indications. RECENT FINDINGS: Allogeneic SCT is an established treatment for AML with intermediate-risk and high-risk cytogenetics in first complete remission (CR1), from matched related donors (MRDs). Similar survival benefits are seen for AML in CR1 with unfavorable cytogenetics using matched unrelated donors (URDs). Molecular characterization has delineated patients with AML at higher risk with normal cytogenetics [e.g., FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)+]. The outcomes of allogeneic SCT are comparable in patients with therapy-related or de-novo AML when adjusted for disease status and cytogenetics. In patients lacking a MRD, the majority will have a suitable alternative using an URD, umbilical cord blood, or haploidentical-related donors; outcomes are either comparable or relatively acceptable compared to a matched sibling donor. Comorbidity indices aid in identifying elderly and debilitated patients who may benefit from SCT; the application of SCT has been further increased by reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. SUMMARY: Allogeneic SCT may be extended to almost all patients with AML, and integration of toxicity and relapse risks will determine the best approach for allogeneic SCT in the future.",,"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical and molecular characterization of the disease have greatly aided in prognostication in both primary and relapsed settings, which may broadly guide therapy, but truly effective standards of care for relapsed AML remain lacking. Traditional chemotherapeutic drugs have modest but limited efficacy in relapsed AML, whereas more novel and potent cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents hold promise and are entering the advanced phases of testing. Targeted therapies for AML have demonstrated activity, often as single agents, generating enthusiasm for further development in subgroups of patients with appropriate molecular anomalies. Finally, allogeneic stem cell transplantation continues to evolve as an effective and potentially curative therapy for limited numbers of patients with relapsed AML.

A phase Ia/II study was designed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of daily panobinostat, administered on two schedules: three times a week every week or every other week on a 28-day treatment cycle in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. The criteria for hematologic dose-limiting toxicities differed between patients with indications associated with severe cytopenias at baseline (leukemia and myeloid disorders) and those less commonly associated with baseline cytopenias (lymphoma and myeloma). In patients with leukemia and myeloid disorders, 60 mg was the MTD for weekly as well as biweekly panobinostat. In patients with lymphoma and myeloma, 40 mg was the recommended dose for phase II evaluation (formal MTD not determined) of weekly panobinostat, and 60 mg was the MTD for biweekly panobinostat. Overall, panobinostat-related grade 3-4 adverse events included thrombocytopenia (41.5%), fatigue (21%) and neutropenia (21%).

METHODS: Methylation of p73 promoter was detected in bone marrow cells from 135 MDS patients and 13 healthy controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The results of MSP were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. The expression of p73 mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Primary bone marrow cells from MDS patients were treated with decitabine, the changes of p73 methylation status and p73 mRNA expression were measured. The role of p73 methylation in the prognosis of MDS and the correlated clinical data were explored. RESULTS: p73 hypermethylation was present in 37.04% of MDS cases and patients with high risk MDS (RAEB-1 and RAEB-2) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p73 methylation than that of low risk MDS (58.8% vs 29.7%, P = 0.002). The expression of p73 mRNA in the methylated group was decreased compared to that of the unmethylated group (P = 0.032). Decitabine treatment decreased the level of p73 methylation and increased the level of p73 transcripts. Patients with p73 methylation progressed rapidly to AML (P < 0.001) and had shorter survival (P = 0.002) than those who did not have p73 methylation. In the multivariate Cox regression model, BM blast and p73 methylation status emerged as independent prognostic factor for overall survival and leukemia free survival.

RESULTS: CDX2 gene transcript levels were detectable in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 108 AML patients and 7 healthy donors, the median expression level were 1179.44 (range 14.15 - 867 961.10) and 105.30 (range 22.30 - 453.11). There was a statistically significant difference in expression level of CDX2 gene between the AML patients and normal donor (P < 0.01). All 14 patients with FLT3-ITD(+) were in CDX2 gene higher expression group (P = 0.018), including 10 patients with normal karyotype. In the 83 treated AML patients (P = 0.046) and 57 higher WBC count (>/= 10x10(9)/L, P = 0.048) patients, the higher expression level of CDX2 gene was associated with lower complete remission (CR) rates.

METHODS: Mutations in exon 8 and 17 of C-kit gene, exon 12 of NPM1 gene, exon 20 of FLT3-TKD gene, and exon 14/15 of FLT3-ITD gene were detected by direct sequencing. Clinical data was collected and followed up if the patient had accepted treatment in our hospital. RESULTS: Among the 656 AML patients, mutations in C-kit exon 8 were found in 6 patients (0.9%), C-kit exon 17 in 33 (5.0%), NPM1 in 169 (25.8%), FLT3-TKD in 46 (7.1%), and FLT3-ITD in 178 (27.1%). Six subtypes of mutations were detected in C-kit exon 8, 8 in C-kit exon 17, 11 in FLT3-TKD, 15 in NPM1, of which 5 were not reported before. C-kit exon 17 mutations were more frequently detected in patients with t(8;21) and exon 8 in patients with inv(16) cytogenetic abnormality. No other gene mutations except FLT3 were detected in M(3) patients. NPM1 and ITD mutations were often detected in individuals with normal cytogenetics or M(5) and M(1) of FAB classification, and accompanied with high white blood cell counts in peripheral blood, high blast counts in bone marrow and low CD34 expression. The older the patients were when diagnosed, the more gene mutations and the higher white blood cell count were detected. More mutations were found in individuals with normal karyotype than that with other karyotypes. It appeared that FLT3-ITD was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.004), NPM1 was not significantly associated with OS, but NPM1(+)/ITD(-) patients had the longest OS.

METHODS: Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis were performed by automatic electrophoresis apparatus to identify serum Ig paraprotein. Immunonephelometry was used to measure serum Ig levels. RESULTS: Out of 101 CLL patients, serum Ig paraprotein detection was found in 20 (19.8%) cases, 13 (12.9%) patients with IgG paraprotein, 7 (6.9%) patients with IgM paraprotein and 1(1.0%) patient with IgA paraprotein.

The incidence of serum IgG paraprotein was high in the group of advanced Binet stage (P = 0.032) and high level of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) (P = 0.013). The incidence of serum IgM paraprotein was high in the group of advanced Binet stage (P = 0.037), high level of TK1 (P = 0.017) and cytogenetic abnormalities of del(11q22.3) (P = 0.006).

Epub 2013 Feb 6.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic leucodepletion plays an established role in the initial treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and possibly other leukaemias presenting with leucostasis. Recently, a new leucodepletion technology, Spectra Optia IDL, has become available that differs from its predecessor, COBE Spectra MNC, by a variety of electronic supports, including by electronic adjustment of buffy coat positioning at the collection port. Given the paucity of patients in need of leucodepletions and marked differences in clinical presentation as well as blast properties (e.g. size, density), formal clinical trials comparing leucodepletion technologies have never been executed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present aggregate data from eight leucodepletions performed in AML patients with clinical signs of leucostasis between 11/2011 and 07/2012 with the new device and compare the apheresis outcomes with those from fifteen leucodepletions performed with the old technology between 06/2010 and 10/2011. RESULTS: Patients did not differ with respect to epidemiological data. Pre-apheresis leucocyte count (WBC) was significantly higher in Spectra Optia IDL patients. Tolerability was excellent with both devices. Basic apheresis denominators such as duration, processed volume, inlet pump rate, ACD-A consumption and product volume were very similar. A negative correlation between pre-apheresis WBC and collection efficiency was noted. Mean collection efficiency for leucocytes with Spectra Optia IDL (47.3%) was similar to that with COBE Spectra MNC (50.5%). Platelet attrition was similar with both devices, approximately 30%. CONCLUSION: The novel, electronically guided leukapheresis system is suitable for leucodepletion.",['(c) 2013 International Society of Blood Transfusion.'],"['German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology of the Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As-Mal conjugated to a surface cysteine in thioredoxin provides a more potent inhibitor for Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase than comparable simple inorganic or organic arsenicals. As-Mal can be coupled to all of the eight cysteine residues of reduced unfolded ribonuclease A or to site-specific locations using appropriate cysteine mutations. We observed particularly strong binding to the two CxxC motifs of protein disulfide isomerase using a mutant RNase in which As-Mal was specifically incorporated at residues 26 and 110.

The study of this protein in hematopoietic malignancies led to conflicting reports about its role as a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on its different functions in the tumor microenvironment. In this study we investigated the variations in SPARC production by peripheral blood cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients at diagnosis and after treatment and we identified the subpopulation of cells that are the prevalent source of SPARC. METHODS: We evaluated SPARC expression using real-time PCR and western blotting. SPARC serum levels were detected by ELISA assay. Finally we analyzed the interaction between exogenous SPARC and imatinib (IM), in vitro, using ATP-lite and cell cycle analysis. RESULTS: Our study shows that the CML cells of patients at diagnosis have a low mRNA and protein expression of SPARC. Low serum levels of this protein are also recorded in CML patients at diagnosis. However, after IM treatment we observed an increase of SPARC mRNA, protein, and serum level in the peripheral blood of these patients that had already started at 3 months and was maintained for at least the 18 months of observation. This SPARC increase was predominantly due to monocyte production. In addition, exogenous SPARC protein reduced the growth of K562 cell line and synergized in vitro with IM by inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase.

Prior to the availability of long-term BCR-ABL inhibitor data, short-term surrogate end points predictive of longer-term outcomes have been identified using data from clinical trials of patients with CML-CP treated with interferon-alpha-based therapy and approved BCR-ABL inhibitors. In patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with imatinib, achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 12 months has been associated with more favorable outcomes, and both CCyR and major cytogenetic response have been used as surrogate end points for regulatory approval. Following approval of second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors in the first-line setting (nilotinib, dasatinib), which have significantly faster and deeper response rates than imatinib, molecular-based surrogate markers at earlier time points of 3 and 6 months are also being explored, although longer follow-up is needed. As patients who achieve early responses show the greatest long-term benefit, these end points may help to identify patients with suboptimal responses early in treatment who might benefit from switching to a different, more effective therapy.",,"['School of Medicine, University of Rochester , Rochester, NY , USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological malignancies, especially lymphomas, predominate among MD patients. It is believed that immune disturbances in SLE, lymphotropic virus superinfections, and long-term immunosuppressive therapy may induce the process of MD. CASE REPORTS: Case 1. A female with a 34-year history of SLE was treated with low doses of glucocorticoids and chloroquine. In July 2011, severe pancytopenia complicated by septic shock was observed and the patient died. Histopathologic examination of bone marrow revealed the presence of a B-cell lymphoma. Case 2. A female with a 26-year history of SLE presented with anti-dsDNA and anti-SSA antibodies. Exacerbations of SLE were treated with high doses of glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. In December 2011, pancytopenia was observed and bone marrow histology was in favor of acute monoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the literature and our own observations confirm the necessity of oncologic follow-up in SLE. The risk of MD in SLE increases with duration of the disease and depends on the serologic profile of SLE and medication used. Hematological exacerbations in SLE, particularly protracted and therapy-resistant anemia and leukopenia, should be differentiated from a hematological malignancy.",,"['Katedra i Klinika Reumatologii i Ukladowych Chorob Tkanki Lacznej Uniwersytetu Medycznego w Lublinie ul.

The distal promoter was methylated in 238/623 cases (38.2%), the core promoter in 8 of 326 cases (2.5%), whereas proximal PM was never detected. CEBPA PM and CEBPA mutations were mutually exclusive. CEBPA distal PM positive cases were characterized by reduced CEBPA mRNA expression levels and elevated white blood cell counts. CEBPA distal PM was less frequent in patients with mutations in FLT3, NPM1 and TET2 and more frequent in cases with RUNX1 and IDH2R140 mutations. Overall, no association of methylation to prognosis was seen. However CEBPA distal PM was associated with inferior outcome in cases with low FLT3-ITD ratio or TET2 mutations. A distinct gene expression profile of CEBPA distal PM positive cases compared to CEBPA mutated and CEBPA distal PM negative cases was observed.

Epub 2013 Jan 31.,"Immunotherapy (eg interferon alpha) in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is currently in clinical trials for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cancer patients commonly have problems with so called immune escape mechanisms that may hamper immunotherapy. Hence, to study the function of the immune system in CML is of interest. In the present paper we have identified immune escape mechanisms in CML with focus on those that directly hamper T cells since these cells are important to control tumor progression. CML patient samples were investigated for the presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), expression of programmed death receptor ligand 1/programmed death receptor 1 (PD-L1/PD-1), arginase 1 and soluble CD25. MDSC levels were increased in samples from Sokal high risk patients (p<0.05) and the cells were present on both CD34 negative and CD34 positive cell populations. Furthermore, expression of the MDSC-associated molecule arginase 1, known to inhibit T cells, was increased in the patients (p = 0.0079). Myeloid cells upregulated PD-L1 (p<0.05) and the receptor PD-1 was present on T cells. However, PD-L1 blockade did not increase T cell proliferation but upregulated IL-2 secretion. Finally, soluble CD25 was increased in high risk patients (p<0.0001). In conclusion T cells in CML patients may be under the control of different immune escape mechanisms that could hamper the use of immunotherapy in these patients. These escape mechanisms should be monitored in trials to understand their importance and how to overcome the immune suppression.",,"['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. lisa.christiansson@igp.uu.se']",,,,,,,,PMC3561335,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-inactivating (SIN) vectors carry a deletion of the U3 enhancer and promoter in the long terminal repeat (LTR), and show reduced genotoxicity in pre-clinical assays. We report a high-definition analysis of the integration preferences of a SIN MLV vector compared to a wild-type-LTR MLV vector in the genome of CD34(+) human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). We sequenced 13,011 unique SIN-MLV integration sites and compared them to 32,574 previously generated MLV sites in human HSPCs. The SIN-MLV vector recapitulates the integration pattern observed for MLV, with the characteristic clustering of integrations around enhancer and promoter regions associated to H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 histone modifications, specialized chromatin configurations (presence of the H2A.Z histone variant) and binding of RNA Pol II.

This process involves de novo formation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation of the adult stem cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The T3-dependence of the formation of adult intestinal stem cell during Xenopus laevis metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to identify genes likely important for adult organ-specific stem cell development. We have cloned and characterized the ectopic viral integration site 1 (EVI) and its variant myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS)/EVI generated via transcription from the upstream MDS promoter and alternative splicing. EVI and MDS/EVI have been implicated in a number of cancers including breast, leukemia, ovarian, and intestinal cancers. We show that EVI and MDS/EVI transcripts are upregulated by T3 in the epithelium but not the rest of the intestine in Xenopus laevis when adult stem cells are forming in the epithelium. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that EVI and MDS/EVI are likely involved in the development and/or proliferation of newly forming adult intestinal epithelial cells.",,"['Section on Molecular Morphogenesis, Program in Cellular Regulation and Metabolism (PCRM), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",,,,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3561350,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 30.,"The microRNA, miR-24, inhibits B cell development and promotes myeloid development of hematopoietic progenitors. Differential regulation of cell survival in myeloid and lymphoid cells by miR-24 may explain how miR-24's affects hematopoietic progenitors. MiR-24 is reported to regulate apoptosis, either positively or negatively depending on cell context. However, no role for miR-24 in regulating cell death has been previously described in blood cells. To examine miR-24's effect on survival, we expressed miR-24 via retrovirus in hematopoietic cells and induced cell death with cytokine or serum withdrawal. We observed that miR-24 enhanced survival of myeloid and B cell lines as well as primary hematopoietic cells. Additionally, antagonizing miR-24 with shRNA in hematopoietic cells made them more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli, suggesting miR-24 functions normally to promote blood cell survival. Since we did not observe preferential protection of myeloid over B cells, miR-24's pro-survival effect does not explain its promotion of myelopoiesis. Moreover, expression of pro-survival protein, Bcl-xL, did not mimic miR-24's impact on cellular differentiation, further supporting this conclusion. Our results indicate that miR-24 is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell survival. This observation has implications for leukemogenesis. Several miRNAs that regulate apoptosis have been shown to function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes during leukemogenesis. MiR-24 is expressed highly in primary acute myelogenous leukemia, suggesting that its pro-survival activity could contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic cells.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America.']",,,,,,,,PMC3559586,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a novel strategy that combines single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and detected germline DAPK1 ASE in 17 out of 120 (14.2%) CLL patients associated with a trend towards younger age at diagnosis. ASE was absent in 63 healthy controls.

However, the mechanism by which HTLV-I causes ATLL has not been fully elucidated. To provide fundamental insights into the multistep process of leukemogenesis, we have mapped the chromosomal abnormalities in 50 ATLL cases to identify potential key regulators of ATLL. RESULTS: The analysis of breakpoints in one ATLL case with the translocations t(14;17)(q32;q22-23) resulted in the identification of a Kruppel zinc finger gene, BCL11B, which plays a crucial role in T-cell development. Among the 7 ATLL cases that we examined by immunofluorescence analysis, 4 displayed low and one displayed moderate BCL11B signal intensities. A dramatically reduced level of the BCL11B protein was also found in HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines. The ectopic expression of BCL11B resulted in significant growth suppression in ATLL-derived cell lines but not in Jurkat cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our genetic and functional data provide the first evidence that a reduction in the level of the BCL11B protein is a key event in the multistep progression of ATLL leukemogenesis.",,"['Faculty of Science and Engineering, Graduate School, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",,,,,,,,PMC3559337,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is used clinically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL) and has activity in vitro against several solid tumor cell lines, with induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation the prime effects. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has an important role in tumorigenesis of various primary cancers and cancer cell by upregulating cell-survival and downregulating tumor suppressor proteins. Here, we found decreased expression of AFP and STAT3 after induction of apoptosis by As(2)O(3) in the AFPGC FU97 cells. Also, the level of the STAT3 target oncogene Bcl-2 was decreased with As(2)O(3), and that of the tumor suppressor Bax was increased. Furthermore, STAT3 expression and depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis were associated. Survival of patients with gastric cancer was lower with AFP and STAT3 double overexpression than with overexpression of either alone. Downregulation of AFP and STAT3 expression plays an important role in As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis of AFPGC cells, which suggests a new mechanism of As(2)O(3)-induced cell apoptosis.

Epub 2013 Jan 31.,"Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247 individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of 1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P<2.27 x 10(-9)) in the discovery analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842).

Epub 2013 Feb 4.,"HSV-1 is the leading cause of sporadic viral encephalitis, with mortality rates approaching 30% despite treatment with the antiviral drug of choice, acyclovir. Permanent neurologic deficits are common in patients that survive, but the mechanism leading to this pathology is poorly understood, impeding clinical advancements in treatment to reduce CNS morbidity. Using magnetic resonance imaging and type I IFN receptor-deficient mouse chimeras, we demonstrate HSV-1 gains access to the murine brain stem and subsequently brain ependymal cells, leading to enlargement of the cerebral lateral ventricle and infection of the brain parenchyma. A similar enlargement in the lateral ventricles is found in a subpopulation of herpes simplex encephalitic patients. Associated with encephalitis is an increase in CXCL1 and CXCL10 levels in the cerebral spinal fluid, TNF-alpha expression in the ependymal region, and the influx of neutrophils of encephalitic mouse brains. Reduction in lateral ventricle enlargement using anti-secretory factor peptide 16 reduces mortality significantly in HSV-1-infected mice without any effect on expression of inflammatory mediators, infiltration of leukocytes, or changes in viral titer. Microglial cells but not infiltrating leukocytes or other resident glial cells or neurons are the principal source of resistance in the CNS during the first 5 d postinfection through a Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-beta-dependent, type I IFN pathway. Our results implicate lateral ventricle enlargement as a major cause of mortality in mice and speculate such an event transpires in a subpopulation of human HSV encephalitic patients.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",,,,,,,"['P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY021725/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007633/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3594081,['NIHMS435452'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been used as a helpful tool for establishing donor chimerism and preventing a relapse of leukemia/lymphoma. However, the effects of DLI on transplanted and recipient thymuses have not been explored. We therefore performed DLI in the intrabone marrow-BMT + thymus transplantation setting. We have found that DLI leads to derangements in both recipient thymuses and transplanted thymuses; by 2 wk after BMT, we saw a decrease in total cell number, a lower percentage of CD4(+)CD8(+) cells, and the obliteration of the thymic corticomedullary junction. Four weeks later, the thymic impairment became more serious. However, when we depleted the CD4(+) T cells (CD4(-)-DLI), the recipient thymic recovery and transplanted thymic development were significantly restored by the treatment. In addition, there were much greater levels of TNF-alpha and Fas ligand, and a lower percentage of regulatory T cells in the DLI group than in the CD4(-)-DLI group. These findings indicate that inflammation induced by DLI, especially by CD4(+) T cells, plays a crucial role in the thymic impairment.",,"['Department of Stem Cell Disorders, Kansai Medical University, 570-8506 Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,PMC3586976,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 4.,"PURPOSE: To identify a robust prognostic gene expression signature as an independent predictor of survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and use it to improve established risk classification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four independent sets totaling 499 patients with AML carrying various cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities were used as training sets. Two independent patient sets composed of 825 patients were used as validation sets. Notably, patients from different sets were treated with different protocols, and their gene expression profiles were derived using different microarray platforms. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used for survival analyses. RESULTS: A prognostic signature composed of 24 genes was derived from a meta-analysis of Cox regression values of each gene across the four training sets. In multivariable models, a higher sum value of the 24-gene signature was an independent predictor of shorter overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in both training and validation sets (P < .01). Moreover, this signature could substantially improve the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification of AML, and patients in three new risk groups classified by the integrated risk classification showed significantly (P < .001) distinct OS and EFS. CONCLUSION: Despite different treatment protocols applied to patients and use of different microarray platforms for expression profiling, a common prognostic gene signature was identified as an independent predictor of survival of patients with AML. The integrated risk classification incorporating this gene signature provides a better framework for risk stratification and outcome prediction than the ELN classification.",,"['University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",,,,,,,"['P50CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3595425,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of seven index cases (28%) harbored the reciprocal RNA chimeras in our initial screening.

Whole-genome sequencing and Southern blotting demonstrated no evidence for a genomic fusion between YPEL5 and PPP1CB. YPEL5/PPP1CB chimera, when introduced into mammalian cells, expressed a truncated PPP1CB protein that demonstrated diminished phosphatase activity.

By using a murine leukemic model carrying both promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PLZF/RARalpha) and RARalpha/PLZF fusion genes, we discovered that 8-chlorophenylthio adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) enhances cellular differentiation and improves gene trans-activation by ATRA in leukemic blasts. Mechanistically, in combination with ATRA, 8-CPT-cAMP activates PKA, causing phosphorylation of PLZF/RARalpha at Ser765 and resulting in increased dissociation of the silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors/nuclear receptor corepressor from PLZF/RARalpha. This process results in changes of local chromatin and transcriptional reactivation of the retinoic acid pathway in leukemic cells. Meanwhile, 8-CPT-cAMP also potentiated ATRA-induced degradation of PLZF/RARalpha through its Ser765 phosphorylation.

However, structural information is lacking that describes the substrate binding mechanism for a monomeric RT. We report here the first crystal structure of a complex between an RNA/DNA hybrid substrate and polymerase-connection fragment of the single-subunit RT from xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus, a close relative of Moloney murine leukaemia virus. A comparison with p66/p51 human immunodeficiency virus-1 RT shows that substrate binding around the polymerase active site is conserved but differs in the thumb and connection subdomains.

In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Dolen and Esendagli [Eur. J. Immunol. 2013. 43: 747-757] show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells develop an adaptive immune phenotype switching mechanism: In response to attack by activated T cells, the leukemia cells quickly downregulate the T-cell costimulatory ligand B7-H2 and reciprocally upregulate the coinhibitory ligands B7-H1 and B7-DC in order to shut down T-cell activation via the PD-1 pathway.

A key factor in this treatment resistance is thought to be the molecular complexity of the disease. Targeted therapy such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sunitinib have been utilized, but only 40% of patients will respond, with the overwhelming majority of these patients relapsing within 1 year. As such the question of intrinsic and acquired resistance in renal cell cancer patients is highly relevant. In order to study resistance to TKIs, with the ultimate goal of developing effective, personalized treatments, sequential tissue after a specific period of targeted therapy is required, an approach which had proved successful in chronic myeloid leukaemia. However the application of such a strategy in renal cell carcinoma is complicated by the high level of both inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, which is a feature of renal cell carcinoma as well as other solid tumors. Intertumoral heterogeneity due to transcriptomic and genetic differences is well established even in patients with similar presentation, stage and grade of tumor. In addition it is clear that there is great morphological (intratumoral) heterogeneity in RCC, which is likely to represent even greater molecular heterogeneity. Detailed mapping and categorization of RCC tumors by combined morphological analysis and Fuhrman grading allows the selection of representative areas for proteomic analysis. Protein based analysis of RCC is attractive due to its widespread availability in pathology laboratories; however, its application can be problematic due to the limited availability of specific antibodies. Due to the dot blot nature of the Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA), antibody specificity must be pre-validated; as such strict quality control of antibodies used is of paramount importance. Despite this limitation the dot blot format does allow assay miniaturization, allowing for the printing of hundreds of samples onto a single nitrocellulose slide. Printed slides can then be analyzed in a similar fashion to Western analysis with the use of target specific primary antibodies and fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies, allowing for multiplexing. Differential protein expression across all the samples on a slide can then be analyzed simultaneously by comparing the relative level of fluorescence in a more cost-effective and high-throughput manner.",,"['Edinburgh Urological Cancer Group, University of Edinburgh. fomahony@staffmail.ed.ac.uk']",,,,,,,"['G1000419/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'ETM37/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']",PMC3582682,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three types of asparaginase are currently available: two are derived from Escherichia coli [native asparaginase and pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase)] and one from Erwinia chrysanthemi (crisantaspase). All three products share the same mechanism of action but have different pharmacokinetic properties, which do not make them easily interchangeable. Among the known toxicities and side-effects, allergic reactions and silent inactivation represent the most important limitations to the prolonged use of any asparaginase product, with associated reduced therapeutic effects and poorer outcomes. Routine real time monitoring can help to identify patients with silent inactivation and facilitate a switch to a different product to ensure continued depletion of asparagine, completion of the treatment schedule and maintenance of outcomes. However, the most appropriate second-line treatment is still a matter of debate. PEG-asparaginase has lower immunogenicity and a longer half-life than native Escherichia coli (E. coli) asparaginase, which makes it useful for both first-line and second-line use with a reduced number of doses. However, PEG-asparaginase displays cross-reactivity with native E. coli asparaginase that may harm its therapeutic effects. Crisantaspase does not display cross-reactivity to either of the E. coli-derived products, which has made crisantaspase the second-line treatment option in a number of recent protocols. As crisantaspase has a much shorter biological half-life than the E. coli-derived products, the appropriate dosage and administration schedule are of paramount importance in delivering treatment with this product.

Six nanoliposomes differing in cationic lipids were formulated and screened in vitro and in vivo for cellular delivery functions in lung cells/tissues. Although the six nanoliposomes showed similar siRNA delivery efficiency in vitro, they exhibited significant differences in pulmonary cellular delivery functions in vivo. Among the various nanoliposomes, cationic dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine and cholesterol (ECL)-based nanoliposomes showed the highest pulmonary cellular delivery in vivo and the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro. The delivery efficiency of fluorescent siRNA in ECL nanoliposomes was 26.2-fold higher than that of naked siRNA in vivo. Treatment with Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1)-specific siRNA (siMcl1) using ECL nanolipoplexes reduced target expression in B16F10 cell lines, whereas control, luciferase-specific siGL2 in ECL nanolipoplexes did not. In metastatic lung cancer mouse models induced by B16F10 or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, intratracheal administration of siMcl1 in ECL nanolipoplexes significantly silenced Mcl1 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissue. Reduced formation of melanoma tumor nodules was observed in the lung.

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member GITR ligand (GITRL) is frequently expressed on leukemia cells in AML and CLL and impairs the reactivity of NK cells which express GITR and upregulate its expression following activation. We developed a strategy to reinforce NK anti-leukemia reactivity by combining disruption of GITR-GITRL interaction with targeting leukemia cells for NK antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using GITR-Ig fusion proteins with modified Fc moieties. Neutralization of leukemia-expressed GITRL by the GITR domain enhanced cytotoxicity and cytokine production of NK cells depending on activation state with NK reactivity being further largely dependent on the engineered affinity of the fusion proteins to the Fc receptor. Compared with wild-type GITR-Ig, treatment of primary AML and CLL cells with mutants containing a S239D/I332E modification potently increased cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine production of NK cells in a target-antigen-dependent manner with additive effects being observed with CLL cells upon parallel exposure to Rituximab.

Given that constitutive PI3K/AKT signaling is a frequent component of hematologic malignancies and the relationship between AKT and Notch in this lineage, we studied the crosstalk between AKT signaling and ERG in megakaryopoiesis. We discovered that constitutive AKT signaling is associated with a dramatic increase in apoptosis of WT megakaryocytes (MKs), but that overexpression of ERG blocks AKT-induced death. We further found that Gata1 mutations protect MKs from activated AKT-induced apoptosis. As a consequence, however, the enhanced signaling inhibits differentiation of Gata1 mutant, but not WT, MKs. Gata1 mutant cells that overexpress ERG with hyperactive AKT are characterized by diminished FOXO1/3a expression and an increased dependency on the c-Jun pathway similar to that seen in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) cell lines, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with knockdown of FOXO3a, or AML with expression of myristoylated Akt. Additionally, we found that the AKT allosteric inhibitor MK2206 caused reduced cell viability and proliferation of AMKL cell lines.

RECENT FINDINGS: The ever-increasing comprehension of the molecular genetics of AML has led to the identification of targets for molecular monitoring of MRD in the majority of AML cases. Likewise, virtually all cases express aberrant immunophenotypes suitable for MRD monitoring by flow cytometry, a progress bolstered by powerful new-generation instruments. The clinical significance of MRD monitoring by either approach has been corroborated by recent results. However, with few exceptions, most of the studies continue to rely on retrospectively determined cut-off levels and time points. Moreover, when applied in parallel, the two approaches have yielded contradictory results.

The heterogeneity of AML is evident from variations in morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular abnormalities. The introduction of genome-wide technologies has enabled an even more detailed molecular analysis of AML. As a result, the molecular landscape of AML is rapidly evolving. The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent advances made in this field, with a special focus on risk stratification of AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical AML has been analysed in great molecular detail by gene expression profiling and more recently through epigenetic profiling and next generation sequencing. This has resulted in the identification of novel biomarkers, some of which appear to have a consistent clinical impact in AML, that is mutations in the genes encoding DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1). In addition, massively parallel sequencing has revealed a great mutational heterogeneity as well as temporal clonal evolution in AML. SUMMARY: The list of acquired mutations with clinical value in AML is growing. Clinical implementation of this multitude of markers will require integrated approaches and selection of markers to facilitate AML risk stratification in the future. The revealed molecular heterogeneity and evolution in AML will have implications for developing targeted therapies.",,"['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 1.,"Several recent reports suggest a possible role for killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) in the onset of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and response to therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To explore this hypothesis, we studied KIRs and their human leukocyte antigen class I ligands in 59 consecutive patients with chronic-phase CML (mean age, 53 years; range, 23-81 years) and a group of 121 healthy control participants belonging to the same ethnic group as the patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence of complete molecular response, obtained after a median of 27 months (range, 4-52 months), was 51.2%. An increased frequency of the activating receptor KIR2DS1 (pm = 0.05) and a reduced frequency of the KIR-ligand combination KIR2DS2/2DL2 absent/C1 present (pm = 0.001) were significantly associated with CML. Moreover, KIR repertoires in patients appeared to influence response to TKI therapy. Homozygosity for KIR haplotype A (pm = 0.01), a decreased frequency of the inhibitory KIR gene KIR2DL2 (pm = 0.02), and low numbers of inhibitory KIR genes (pm = 0.05) were all significantly associated with achievement of complete molecular remission. These data suggest that a decrease in properly stimulated and activated NK cells might contribute to the occurrence of CML and indicate homozygosity for KIR haplotype A as a promising immunogenetic marker of complete molecular response that could help clinicians decide whether to withdraw treatment in patients with CML.","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2013 Feb 1.,"Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) commonly complicate the care of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT). We developed a modified CLABSI (MCLABSI) definition that attempts to exclude pathogens usually acquired because of disruption of mucosal barriers during the vulnerable neutropenic period following HCT that are generally included under the original definition (OCLABSI). We conducted a retrospective study of all AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT between August 2009 and December 2011 at the Cleveland Clinic (N = 73), identifying both OCLABSI and MCLABSI incidence. The median age at transplantation was 52 years (range, 16 to 70); 34 had a high (>/=3) HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI); 34 received bone marrow (BM), 24 received peripheral stem cells (PSC), and 15 received umbilical cord blood cells (UCB). Among these 73 patients, 23 (31.5%) developed OCLABSI, of whom 16 (69.6%) died, and 8 (11%) developed MCLABSI, of whom 7 (87.5%) died. OCLABSI was diagnosed a median of 9 days from HCT: 5 days (range, 2 to 12) for UCB and 78 days (range, 7 to 211) for BM/PSC (P < .001). MCLABSI occurred a median of 12 days from HCT, with similar earlier UCB and later BM/PSC diagnosis (P = .030). Risk factors for OCLABSI in univariate analysis included CBC (P < .001), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch (P = .005), low CD34(+) count (P = .007), low total nucleated cell dose (P = .016), and non-Caucasian race (P = .017). Risk factors for OCLABSI in multivariable analysis were UCB (P < .001) and high HCT-CI (P = .002). There was a significant increase in mortality for both OCLABSI (hazard ratio, 7.14; CI, 3.31 to 15.37; P < .001) and MCLABSI (hazard ratio, 6.44; CI, 2.28 to 18.18; P < .001). CLABSI is common and associated with high mortality in AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT, especially in UCB recipients and those with high HCT-CI. We propose the MCLABSI definition to replace the OCLABSI definition, given its greater precision for identifying preventable infection in HCT patients.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, during the past decades, IVM was mainly offered to patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, the development of fertility preservation has recently opened new perspectives in the field of IVM. The present review summarizes uncommon indications of IVM, which is a viable option to treat infertility in patients with ovarian resistance to FSH, but may also be considered to preserve fertility in leukemia as well as before ovarian transposition and endometrioma excision.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

This suggests that congenital ALL is a biologically different disease, and thus may be caused by a distinct set of mutations. To understand the somatic and germline mutations contributing to congenital ALL, the protein-coding regions in the genome were captured and whole-exome sequencing was employed for the identification of single-nucleotide variants and small insertion and deletions in the germlines as well as the primary tumors of four patients with congenital ALL. METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed on Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, California). Reads were aligned to the human reference genome and the Genome Analysis Toolkit was used for variant calling. An in-house developed Ensembl-based variant annotator was used to richly annotate each variant. RESULTS: There were 1-3 somatic, protein-damaging mutations per ALL, including a novel mutation in Sonic Hedgehog. Additionally, there were many germline mutations in genes known to be associated with cancer predisposition, as well as genes involved in DNA repair. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to comprehensively characterize the germline and somatic mutational profile of all protein-coding genes patients with congenital ALL.

However, no data is available on the influence of SM itself on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated multidrug resistance. P-gp is at least partly located in sphingolipid-enriched lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane, and its activity depends on the lipid profile of the membrane, which could be altered by therapeutical SM liposomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of liposomal SM on P-gp activity, P-gp distribution in microdomains, SM content of the membrane domains, and sensitivity of human lymphoblastic CEM cells toward cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Assays were conducted in CEM and multidrug resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells. SM-only liposomes were prepared by a newly developed ethanol injection protocol and thoroughly characterized. Inclusion of SM into the membrane was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Influence of SM liposomes on P-gp activity was assessed by rhodamine efflux and calcein assay, and sensitivity toward cytotoxic drugs was analyzed by flow cytometric 7-AAD staining. Influence on P-gp distribution was analyzed by Western blot after density gradient centrifugation. SM 16:0, 18:0, and 24:1 were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. P-gp was mainly located in nonraft fractions, which did not change upon liposome treatment. Liposomes increased SM 16:0 and SM 24:1 content in nonraft domains, but not in raft domains of multidrug resistant cells. SM-only liposomes did not influence P-gp activity and chemosensitivity.

Therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered in cases of DIC where clinical features of thrombosis predominate. Heparin is not recommended in those patients with a high risk of bleeding, (Moderate quality). However, prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin or low molecular we ight heparin is recommended in critically ill and non-bleeding patients with DIC for prevention of venous thromboembolism (Moderate to High quality). Although further prospective evidence from randomized controlled trials is required, administration of antithrombin or recombinant thrombomodulin may be considered in certain patients with DIC.

Human NK cells recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules via surface receptors [killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and NKG2A] delivering signals that inhibit NK cell function and kill HLA class I-deficient target cells, a frequent event in tumors or virus-infected cells. NK cell triggering is mediated by activating receptors that recognize ligands expressed primarily on tumors or virus-infected cells. NK cells play also a key role in the cure of high-risk leukemias. Thus, donor-derived ""alloreactive"" NK cells are fundamental effectors in adult acute myeloid leukemia and in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients undergoing haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Alloreactive NK cells mediate killing of leukemia cells and patient's dendritic cell, thus preventing respectively leukemic relapses and graft-vs-host responses. Cytofluorimetric analysis of KIRs expressed by NK cells allows to define the size of the alloreactive NK subset and the selection of the best potential donor. Recently, it has been shown that also the expression of activating KIRs, in particular the (C2-specific) KIR2DS1, may contribute to donor NK alloreactivity. It has also been established a correlation between the size of the alloreactive NK cell population and the clinical outcome. Notably, the alloreactive NK cells derived from donor's hematopoietic stem cells are generated and persist in patients over time. The high survival rates of patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT highlight an important new reality in the setting of allograft performed to cure otherwise fatal leukemias. Novel approaches are in progress to further improve the clinical outcome based on the infusion of donor alloreactive NK cells either as a component of the transplanted cell population or as in vitro expanded NK cells.",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto Di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu Rome, Italy ; Universita di Pavia Pavia, Italy.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NK alloreactivity', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'graft-vs-host disease', 'haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'killer Ig-like receptors', 'natural killer cells']",,PMC3561663,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the hematopoietic system, stem cells balance these mechanisms to maintain steady-state hematopoiesis for the lifetime of the organism, and to effectively regenerate the system following injury. Defects in the proper control of self-renewal and differentiation can be potentially devastating and contribute to the development of malignancies. In this review, we trace the emerging role of Wnt signaling as a critical regulator of distinct aspects of self-renewal and differentiation, its contribution to the maintenance of homeostasis and regeneration, and how the pathway can be hijacked to promote leukemia development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive search was carried out for studies on the effect of provider case volume on the quality of care or survival in childhood cancer. Information about study characteristics, comparisons, results, and quality assessment were abstracted. RESULTS: In total, 14 studies were included in this systematic review. Studies with a low risk of bias provide evidence that treatment of children with brain tumours, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, or children receiving treatment with allogenic bone marrow transplantation in higher volume hospitals, specialised hospitals, or by high case volume providers, is related with a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides support for the statement that higher volume hospitals, higher case volume providers, and specialised hospitals are related to the better outcome in paediatric oncology.

DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: Queen Mary Hospital and Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 seen between January 1995 and August 2011. RESULTS: We identified 123 Chinese patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, diagnosed at a median age of 4.9 years (range, 0.1-16.1 years); 75 (61%) were males. They were followed up for a median of 9.7 years (range, 0.2-27.6 years). Most (80%) of the patients participated in our surveillance programme. Twelve patients developed malignancies at the ages of 0.8 to 41.6 years. These malignancies included: peripheral nerve sheath tumours (n=3), juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (n=2), optic nerve glioma (n=1), thalamic pilocytic astrocytoma (n=1), rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), osteosarcoma (n=1), neuroblastoma (n=1), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n=1), and breast carcinoma and subsequently carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (n=1). Among them, three had their tumours (optic glioma, thalamic astrocytoma, sacral malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour) initially detected by surveillance imaging. Four patients survived without disease progression, three are alive with active disease, the remaining five died (when aged 3 to 56 years) with progressive or relapsed malignancies. The latter patients died from a neuroblastoma, a juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, a lymphoma, and a second primary tumour (carcinoma of ampulla of Vater, at the age of 56 years). In neurofibromatosis type 1 patients with malignancy, overall 30-year survival was significantly shorter than in those without malignancy (35% vs 93%, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Chinese patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are susceptible to different malignancies which contribute to mortality. These findings are similar to reports from overseas. Outcomes were unfavourable, except in patients having low-grade gliomas. Surveillance imaging may help early detection of deep-seated malignancies but the benefits accruing from such monitoring warrants prospective evaluation.",,"['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. cheukkld@hkucc.hku.hk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is noted as another gastrointestinal complication in the context of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after HSCT. The possibility of a relationship between these two distinct gastrointestinal disorders, however, remains obscure. A 6-year-old boy with acute myelogenous leukemia developed severe hematemesis 4 months after myeloablative HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor. The diagnosis of GAVE was made by upper endoscopy and histological examination. The patient simultaneously developed frequent diarrhea and significant hypoproteinemia, consistent with a diagnosis of PLE. This co-occurrence of GAVE and PLE against a background of chronic GVHD was successfully treated with cyclosporin A and prednisolone. To our knowledge, this is the first report of GAVE concurrent with PLE following HSCT. The possible association of GAVE and PLE in chronic GVHD is discussed.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transgenic and retroviral mouse models, Lmo2 expression can be enforced in multiple hematopoietic lineages but leukemia only arises from T cells. These data suggest that Lmo2 confers clonal growth advantage in T-cell progenitors. We analyzed proliferation, differentiation, and cell death in CD2-Lmo2 transgenic thymic progenitor cells to understand the cellular effects of enforced Lmo2 expression. Most impressively, Lmo2 transgenic T-cell progenitor cells were blocked in differentiation, quiescent, and immortalized in vitro on OP9-DL1 stromal cells. These cellular effects were concordant with a transcriptional signature in Lmo2 transgenic T-cell progenitor cells that is also present in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and early T-cell precursor ALL. These results are significant in light of the crucial role of Lmo2 in the maintenance of the HSC.

The mechanisms of relative resistance of non-APL cells are not well understood, but emerging evidence suggests that activation of negative feedback regulatory loops and pathways contributes to such resistance. We provide evidence that a signaling cascade involving the kinase RSK1 is engaged in a negative feedback manner during arsenic-treatment of cells and exhibits regulatory effects on growth and survival of AML cells in response to treatment with As(2)O(3). Our data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition or molecular disruption of expression of RSK1 enhances As(2)O(3)-dependent apoptosis and/or growth inhibition of AML cells. Importantly, combination of a pharmacological inhibitor of RSK and As(2)O(3) results in enhanced suppression of primary AML leukemic progenitors. Altogether, our findings suggest an important regulatory role for RSK1 in the generation of the effects of As(2)O(3) in AML cells.

Among NPM1mut patients, FLT3wt and low ratio (<0.5) subgroups showed similar overall survival, relapse risk, and leukemia-free survival, whereas high ratio (>/=0.5) patients had a worse outcome. In NPM1wt AML, FLT3-ITD subgroups showed a comparable outcome, with higher risk of relapse and shortened overall survival than FLT3wt patients. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in CR1 was associated with a reduced relapse risk in all molecular subgroups with the exception of NPM1mut AML with absent or low ratio FLT3-ITD.

Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts.

It is uncertain whether there is specificity among Bcl-2 family members in the survival of plasma cells and whether their expression is linked to specific extrinsic factors. We found here that deletion of the gene encoding the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in plasma cells resulted in rapid depletion of this population in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the receptor BCMA was needed to establish high expression of Mcl-1 in bone marrow but not spleen plasma cells and that establishing this survival pathway preceded the component of plasma cell differentiation that depends on the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1.

Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase. Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies.

However, the mechanisms by which it suppresses tumors have not been explored.

Most importantly, the plant extract had limited toxicity toward healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). After THP-1 leukemic cells were treated with 50-100 microg/mL EFW for one day, the S phase DNA content of the cells increased, while treatment with 200-400 microg/mL caused the cells to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase. Notably, EFW did not affect A-549 lung cancer cells. The effectiveness of EFW against THP-1 cells may be through caspase-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells, which is mediated through the Fas and mitochondrial pathways.

Epub 2013 Jan 30.,"Autotaxin (ATX) has been reported to act as a motility and growth factor in a variety of cancer cells. The ATX protein acts as a secreted lysophospholipase D by converting lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which signals via G-protein-coupled receptors and has important functions in cell migration and proliferation. This study demonstrates that ATX expression is specifically upregulated and functionally active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of the FLT3 receptor gene. Moreover, ATX expression was also found in normal human CD34+ progenitor cells and selected myeloid and lymphoid subpopulations. Enforced expression of mutant FLT3-ITD by retroviral vector transduction increased ATX mRNA in selected cell lines, whereas inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling by sublethal doses of PKC412 or SU5614 led to a significant downregulation of ATX mRNA and protein levels. In the presence of LPC, ATX expression significantly increased proliferation. LPA induced proliferation, regardless of ATX expression, and induced chemotaxis in all tested human leukemic cell lines and human CD34(+) progenitors. LPC increased chemotaxis only in cells with high expression of endogenous ATX by at least 80%, demonstrating the autocrine action of ATX. Inhibition of ATX using a small molecule inhibitor selectively induced killing of ATX-expressing cell lines and reduced motility in these cells. Our data suggest that the production of bioactive LPA through ATX is involved in controlling proliferation and migration during hematopoiesis and that deregulation of ATX contributes to the pathogenesis of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

To substantiate evidence of whether immune interventions in patients with impending relapse, defined by incomplete lineage-specific DCC, may prevent hematological relapse, we performed a retrospective nested case control study. Unsorted and lineage-specific DCC were measured in 134 patients. Forty-three patients had an incomplete CD34(+)-DCC with no other evidence of relapse. After immediate tapering of immunosuppressive treatment (30 patients) and/or infusion of donor lymphocytes (10 patients), 21 patients remained in remission (conversion to complete lineage-specific DCC) and 22 relapsed. Relapse-free survival at 3 years of the 91 patients with stable DCC and of the 43 patients with incomplete DCC was 74% (95% confidence interval (CI), 64-83%) and 40% (95% CI, 24-58%), respectively. OS rates were 79% (95% CI, 70-88%) and 52% (95% CI, 35-69%), respectively. These results, with 49% of patients with impending relapse successfully treated with immune intervention, highly suggest that analysis of CD34(+)-DCC is an important tool for monitoring and the management of AML and MDS patients after allo-SCT.",,"['Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a decision analysis to determine the efficacy of myeloablative transplantation from a genetically HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 allele-matched unrelated donor for patients with Ph chromosome-negative ALL aged 21-54 years. The transition probabilities were estimated from the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group studies (ALL93; n=80, ALL97; n=82), and the Japan Marrow Donor Program database (transplantation in first CR (CR1): n=177). The primary outcome measure was the 10-year survival probability with or without quality of life (QOL) adjustment. Subgroup analyses were performed according to risk stratification based on the WBC count and cytogenetics, and according to age stratification. In all patients, unrelated transplantation in CR1 was shown to be superior in analyses both with and without QOL adjustment (40.8 vs 28.4% and 43.9 vs 29.0%, respectively). A similar tendency was observed in all subgroups. The decision model was sensitive to the probability of leukemia-free survival following chemotherapy and the probability of survival after transplantation in standard-risk and higher-aged patients. Unrelated transplantation in CR1 improves the long-term survival probability in patients who lack an HLA-matched sibling.

(Asteraceae) preparations are used in folk medicine in Cameroon to treat a number of ailments, including prostate cancer and malaria, and is used as an anthelmintic, adaptogen and antidote. The aim of this study was to continue the validation of the activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth. extracts and isolated molecules against cancer cell lines following the previous isolation of an anti-prostate cancer sugar ester from the root extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acetone extracts of Vernonia guineensis Benth. leaves were tested for activity against 10 cancer cell lines (Breast-MDA-MB-231, Breast-MCF-7, Colon-HCT-116, Leukemia-HL-60, Lung-A549, Melanoma-A375, Ovarian-OVCAR3, Pancreas-Mia-paca, Prostate-PC-3 and Prostate-DU-145). The acetone extract was subjected to bioactivity guided fractionation. Anti-proliferation and clonogenic activity of the isolated compounds were tested. The WST-1 assay was used for the anti-proliferation activity, while the standard clonogenic test was used to determine the clonogenic activity. RESULTS: The acetone extract of Vernonia guineensis Benth. demonstrated in vitro activity ranging from IC50 4-26mug/mL against the 10 cell lines. Activity guided fractionation of this extract yielded two sesquiterpene lactones, isolated for the first time from the genus Vernonia. The compounds were characterized using spectroscopic experiments, including a combination of 1D and 2D NMR data. Vernopicrin (1) and Vernomelitensin (2) demonstrated in vitro activity against human cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 0.35-2.04muM (P<0.05) and 0.13-1.5muM (P<0.05), respectively, between the most and least sensitive cell lines for each compound. Vernopicrin was most active against the human melanoma (A375) cell line and least active against the lung cancer (A549) cell line, while Vernomelitensin was also most active against the human melanoma (A375) cell line and least active against the breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line. Both compounds also demonstrated anticlonogenic activity. CONCLUSION: The cytotoxicity demonstrated by the crude extract and isolated sesquiterpenes against cancer cell lines highlights the medicinal potential of V. guineensis. The selective anti-proliferation and dose dependent anticlonogenic activities suggest that the identified sesquiterpenes could be potential antitumor agents.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was carried out to investigate the effect of amentoflavone isolated from methanolic root extract of CF on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory cascade of events associated to the oxidative and nitrative stress, and TNF-alpha production in rat astrocytoma cell line (C6) and human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1), respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat astrocytoma cells (C6) were stimulated with LPS (10mug/ml) alone and in the presence of different concentrations of amentoflavone (0.1-3mug/ml) for 24h incubation period. Nitrite release, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced-glutathione (GSH) in C6 cells were estimated; while the TNF-alpha level was estimated in THP-1 cell lysate. In vivo analgesic activity was evaluated using mouse writhing and hot plate tests while the anti-inflammatory effect was investigated using carrageenan-induced oedema test. RESULTS: LPS (10mug/ml) significantly (P<0.05) stimulated C6 cells to release nitrite, ROS, MDA, and TNF-alpha generation while GSH was down regulated in comparison to control. However, amentoflavone significantly (P<0.05) attenuated nitrite, ROS, MDA and TNF-alpha generation and also up regulated the level of GSH. Amentoflavone per se did not have any significant effect on C6 and THP-1 cells. Amentoflavone (6.25-50mg/kg) significantly (P<0.05) reduced number of writhes and also increase pain threshold in hot plate test. It produced time course significant (P<0.05) decrease in oedema formation in rodents.

These stress conditions may facilitate the selection of tumor cells with an inherent ability to decrease apoptotic potential. Therefore, selective targeting of tumor cells under glucose deprivation conditions may provide an effective alternative strategy for cancer therapy. In the present study, we investigated the effects of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) inhibition on glucose deprivation-induced cell death and the underlying mechanisms in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. PF4708671, a selective inhibitor of S6K1, and knockdown of S6K1 with specific siRNA enhanced cell death induced under glucose deprivation conditions. Moreover, inhibition of S6K1 led to apoptosis in glucose-starved MCF-7 cells via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and survivin. Further experiments revealed that sorafenib, shown to be involved in Mcl-1 and survivin downregulation via mTOR/S6K1 inhibition significantly promotes cell death under glucose deprivation conditions. These findings collectively suggest that S6K1 plays an important role in tumor cell survival under stress conditions, and thus inhibition of S6K1 may be an effective strategy for sensitizing cells to glucose deprivation.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

HOTAIR coordinates with chromatin-modifying enzymes and regulates gene silencing. It is overexpressed in various carcinomas including breast cancer. Herein, we demonstrated that HOTAIR is crucial for cell growth and viability and its knockdown induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We also demonstrated that HOTAIR is transcriptionally induced by estradiol (E2). Its promoter contains multiple functional estrogen response elements (EREs). Estrogen receptors (ERs) along with various ER coregulators such as histone methylases MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia 1) and MLL3 and CREB-binding protein/p300 bind to the promoter of HOTAIR in an E2-dependent manner. Level of histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation, histone acetylation, and RNA polymerase II recruitment is enriched at the HOTAIR promoter in the presence of E2. Knockdown of ERs and MLLs downregulated the E2-induced HOTAIR expression. Thus, similar to protein-coding gene transcription, E2-induced transcription of antisense transcript HOTAIR is coordinated via ERs and ER coregulators, and this mechanism of HOTAIR overexpression potentially contributes towards breast cancer progression.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],"['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole"", 'CBP', 'CREB-binding protein', 'ChIP', 'DAPI', 'DMEM', ""Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium"", 'E2', 'ER', 'ERE', 'FBS', 'H3 lysine-4', 'H3K27', 'H3K4', 'HOTAIR', 'HOX antisense intergenic RNA', 'HOXC', 'JAM2', 'MLL', 'MLL histone methylases', 'PBS', 'PCDHB5', 'PRC2', 'RNA polymerase II', 'RNAP II', 'TUNEL', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'epigenetics', 'estradiol', 'estrogen receptor', 'estrogen receptors', 'estrogen response element', 'fetal bovine serum', 'histone H3 lysine 27', 'homeobox C', 'junction adhesion molecule 2', 'lncRNA', 'long noncoding RNA', 'mixed lineage leukemia', 'phosphate-buffered saline', 'polycomb repressive complex 2', 'protocadherin B5', 'siSENSE', 'small interfering sense', 'terminal dUTP nicked end labeling']","['R15 CA113747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 ES019129/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '1R15 ES019129-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '2R15 CA113747-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3679254,['NIHMS446527'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cryptococcus neoformans osteomyelitis is a rare infection that occurs mainly during disseminated forms. OBSERVATION: A 72-year-old diabetic patient, treated with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (since 10 months) for lymphocytic leukemia presented with osteolysis of the fourth left hand metacarpien the histological examination of which revealed C. neoformans. This bone involvement was associated with costal osteolytis and pulmonary cryptococcosis but central nervous system (CNS) was spared. Fluconazole was administered intravenously for 15 days, then switched to oral route for 6 months with favorable clinical course. This case describes an unusual clinical presentation of disseminated cryptococcosis without CNS involvement with multiple osseous metastases. A review of cryptococcal osteomyelitis cases reported in adult from 2000 to 2011 is also discussed. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcosis is a rare infection that should be discussed in seriously immunocompromized patients presenting with osteomyelitis even in the absence of CNS involvement.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We, along with others, have found that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has anti-angiogenic and anti-vasopermeability properties both in cell culture and animal models by counteracting the biological actions of VEGF. However, effects of PEDF on VEGF-exposed myeloma cells remain unknown. In this study, we examined whether and how PEDF could inhibit the VEGF-induced proliferation and survival of myeloma cells. PEDF, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic, ebselen, or an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, diphenylene iodonium significantly inhibited the VEGF-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increase in anti-apoptotic and growth-promoting factor, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) expression, and proliferation in U266 myeloma cells. VEGF blocked apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells isolated from patients, which was prevented by PEDF. PEDF also reduced p22phox levels in VEGF-exposed U266 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant-negative human Rac-1 mutant mimicked the effects of PEDF on ROS generation and Mcl-1 expression in U266 cells. Our present study suggests that PEDF could block the VEGF-induced proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma U266 cells through its anti-oxidative properties via suppression of p22phox, one of the membrane components of NADPH oxidase. Suppression of VEGF signaling by PEDF may be a novel therapeutic target for multiple myeloma.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In human hematological malignancies, c-KIT is mostly expressed by progenitor cell neoplasia and seldom by those involving mature cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are actually licensed for the first- and second-line treatment of human hematologic disorders. Aim of the present study was to evaluate c-KIT mRNA and protein expression and complementary DNA (cDNA) mutations in canine leukemia. Eleven acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) and 12 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were enrolled in this study. The amounts of c-KIT mRNA and protein were determined, in peripheral blood samples, by using quantitative real time RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry, respectively. The presence of mutations on c-KIT exons 8-11 and 17 were investigated by cDNA sequencing. Higher amounts of c-KIT mRNA were found in ALL/AUL compared to CLL, and this latter showed a lower pattern of gene expression. Transcriptional data were confirmed at the protein level. No significant gain-of-function mutations were ever observed in both ALL/AUL and CLL. Among canine hematological malignancies, ALL/AUL typically show a very aggressive biological behavior, partly being attributable to the lack of efficacious therapeutic options. The high level of c-KIT expression found in canine ALL/AUL might represent the rationale for using TKIs in future clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Muscle biopsies were used for a broad immunohistological evaluation of tissue damage and inflammation, as well as identification of infected cells through in situ hybridization. DNA extracted from patients' PBMC was used to identify the virus genotype by sequencing and to assess the proviral load by quantitative PCR. Anti-viral antibodies in plasma samples were titrated by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Patients originate from HTLV-1 endemic areas, the West Indies and West Africa. Histological alterations and inflammation in patients muscles were mostly moderate, with classical features of idiopathic myositis and rare HTLV-1-infected infiltrating cells. In all patients, HTLV-1 belonged to the A subtype, transcontinental subgroup. Anti-HTLV-1 antibodies titers were high, but the proviral load was not elevated compared to asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. CONCLUSION: We show here that muscle inflammation is moderate in HAIM, and accompanied by a low HTLV-1 proviral load, suggesting that the pathogenetic events do not exactly mirror those of other HTLV-1-associated inflammatory diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

SETTING: University hospital-based IVF clinic. PATIENT(S): A total of 164 frozen embryos that survived thawing were cultured in media supplemented with LIF and/or gp130 or control media. INTERVENTION(S): Morphological development was evaluated by light microscopy. Protein expression profiles of single blastocysts were evaluated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-based intact cell mass spectrometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryo development and protein content. RESULT(S): Addition of gp130 to culture media improved blastocyst formation (73% vs. 43%). Addition of LIF to the culture media did not improve embryo development. Protein fingerprint spectra were obtained that revealed significant intensity changes for multiple molecular species including thymosin beta-10, thymosin beta-4, histone H2A, histone H2B, histone H4, ubiquitin, ubiquitin-T, and acyl-CoA binding protein. CONCLUSION(S): Glycoprotein 130, but not LIF, seems to be beneficial for preimplantation embryo development, implicating a physiological role in regulating preimplantation development in humans and thus ought to be included in culture media designed for embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. Furthermore, these findings highlight the great potential of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and intact cell mass spectrometry as a versatile tool in reproductive medicine research.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse the state of paediatric oncology between 1995 and 2004 in Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study analysed all patients under the age of 18 who were diagnosed with cancer in Cote d'Ivoire over a period of 10 years (January 1995 - December 2004) with regard to demographics, types of pathology, delay in diagnosis and treatment, treatment modalities, abandonment of treatment and survival rate. RESULTS: Of 405 patients diagnosed with cancer, 331 were included in the study. Burkitt's lymphoma was the most common malignancy (73.6%), followed by nephroblastoma (14.5%) and acute leukaemia (4%). Delay in diagnosis occurred in 38.7% of cases and ranged from 1 to 3 months; the average delay from diagnosis to starting treatment was 18 days. An abdominal mass and swelling of the jaw were the most common clinical presentations. Almost half of the patients (48.6%) were lost to follow-up and over a third (39.3%) died shortly after admission owing to advanced disease. The overall survival rate was 9.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer in children in Cote d'Ivoire was dominated by Burkitt's lymphoma. The rate of loss to follow-up of almost 50% is grounds for concern. The overall survival rate of 9.4% is very low, but such figures are not uncommon for African countries.

The perinucleolar heterochromatin of lymphocytes in smear preparations was visualized using a simple, but sensitive cytochemical method for the demonstration of DNA. The perinucleolar heterochromatin was also easily visible as unstained perinucleolar regions in specimens stained for RNA. In addition, the perinucleolar heterochromatin of lymphocytes was distinct and apparent in the transmission electron microscope using conventional as well as cytochemical methods for visualization of chromatin structures. Despite the great variability, the maturation of leukemic lymphocytes was accompanied by an increased width of the perinucleolar heterochromatin shell. It seems to be also interesting that the perinucleolar region of both immature as well as mature leukemia lymphocytes contains heterochromatin bodies about 2microm in diameter. They appeared to be a regular component of the perinucleolar heterochromatin shell and were apparently different from other nuclear bodies present at the nucleolus. In contrary to other known nuclear bodies, perinucleolar heterochromatin bodies in leukemia lymphocytes consisted only of conglomerates of DNA containing chromatin fibrils and did not contain other structural components including RNA. The presence of perinucleolar heterochromatin bodies in the perinucleolar region of leukemia lymphocytes is not contradictory with the present knowledge on that nuclear territory.

Standard induction therapy worldwide for all patients deemed fit for treatment (excluding those with acute promyelocytic leukemia) remains unchanged for over 40 years and consists of Ara-C administered by continuous infusion in combination with a topoisomerase II inhibitor (e.g., daunorubicin, idarubicin and mitoxantrone). Despite decades of clinical investigation, the optimum dose of both agents still remains unclear. Although higher doses of Ara-C have been shown to improve response rates, the elderly poorly tolerate these regimens. Resistance mechanisms also develop or may be present at diagnosis resulting in poor outcomes. Elacytarabine (CP-4055), an elaidic acid ester of Ara-C, has been developed using lipid vector technology in an attempt to overcome these limitations.

Ara-C has a number of limitations such as a rapid deactivation by cytidine deaminase leading to the formation of a biologically inactive metabolite, Ara-U (1beta-d-arabinofuranosyluracil), a low lipophilicity, and fast clearance from the body. To address these problems, we developed a conjugate in which hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimer, G4-OH [""D""] and PEG were used as carriers for the drug (Ara-C). The conjugates were synthesized using an efficient multistep protection/deprotection method resulting in the formation of a covalent bond between the primary hydroxyl group of Ara-C and dendrimer/PEG. The structure, physicochemical properties, and drug release kinetics were characterized extensively. (1)H NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry suggested covalent attachment of 10 Ara-C molecules to the dendrimer. The release profile of Ara-C in human plasma and in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) showed that the conjugates released the drug over 14 days in PBS, with the release sped up in plasma. In PBS, while most of the drug is released from PEG-Ara-C, the dendrimer continues to release the drug in a sustained fashion. The results also suggested that the formation of the inactive form of Ara-C (Ara-U) was delayed upon conjugation of Ara-C to the polymers.

However, direct binding of the protein to the polymer carrier could cause considerable problems, such as decreasing the binding capacity of mAb to its target. Here, we introduce a novel strategy of joining a targeting moiety to a polymeric conjugate with cytostatic drug. The scFv of B1 mAb (specific for BCL1 leukemia cells) was tagged with peptide K ((VAALKEK)4). Peptide E ((VAALEKE)4), which forms a stable coiled coil structure heterodimer with peptide K, was assembled with the HPMA copolymers bearing doxorubicin. Such targeted polymeric conjugates possess very selective and high binding activity toward BCL1 cells. Similarly, targeted polymeric conjugates exert approximately 100 times higher cytostatic activity toward BCL1 cells in comparison to nontargeted conjugates in vitro. At the same time, the conjugates have comparable and rather low cytostatic activity for 38C13 cells, which are used as a negative control, in vitro.",,"['Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., Heyrovskeho nam. 2, 162 06, Prague 6, Czech Republic. pola@imc.cas.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, we examined the in vivo anti-leukaemic efficacy of the clinical SINE compound KPT-330 against T-ALL and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. These studies demonstrated striking in vivo activity of KPT-330 against T-ALL and AML cells, with little toxicity to normal murine haematopoietic cells.

Although recent regimens with L-asparaginase substantially improved outcomes, novel therapeutic approaches are still needed to enhance clinical response. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and anti-cancer activities. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-tumour activities of resveratrol against the NK cell lines KHYG-1, NKL, NK-92 and NK-YS. Resveratrol induced robust G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner for all four cell lines. In addition, resveratrol suppressed constitutively active STAT3 in all the cell lines and inhibited JAK2 phosphorylation but had no effect on other upstream mediators of STAT3 activation, such as PTEN, TYK2, and JAK1. Resveratrol also induced downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL1 and survivin, two downstream effectors of the STAT3 pathway. Finally, resveratrol induced synergistic effect on the apoptotic and antiproliferative activities of L-asparaginase against KHYG-1, NKL and NK-92 cells. These results suggest that resveratrol may have therapeutic potential against NK cell malignancies. Furthermore, our finding that resveratrol is a bonafide JAK2 inhibitor extends its potential benefits to other diseases with dysregulated JAK2 signaling.",,"['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan.']",,,,,,,,PMC3555980,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While JAK2-translocations occur in myeloid, B-cell and T-cell lymphoid neoplasms, our findings suggest their incidence among the last group is low. Here we describe the genomic, transcriptional and signalling characteristics of PCM1-JAK2 formed by t(8;9)(p22;p24) in a trio of cell lines established at indolent (MAC-1) and aggressive (MAC-2A/2B) phases of a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). To investigate signalling, PCM1-JAK2 was subjected to lentiviral knockdown which inhibited 7 top upregulated genes in t(8;9) cells, notably SOCS2/3. SOCS3, but not SOCS2, was also upregulated in a chronic eosinophilic leukemia bearing PCM1-JAK2, highlighting its role as a central signalling target of JAK2 translocation neoplasia. Conversely, expression of GATA3, a key T-cell developmental gene silenced in aggressive lymphoma cells, was partially restored by PCM1-JAK2 knockdown. Treatment with a selective JAK2 inhibitor (TG101348) to which MAC-1/2A/2B cells were conspicuously sensitive confirmed knockdown results and highlighted JAK2 as the active moiety. PCM1-JAK2 signalling required pSTAT5, supporting a general paradigm of STAT5 activation by JAK2 alterations in lymphoid malignancies. MAC-1/2A/2B--the first JAK2-translocation leukemia/lymphoma cell lines described--display conspicuous JAK/STAT signalling accompanied by T-cell developmental and autoimmune disease gene expression signatures, confirming their fitness as CTCL disease models.

These serious adverse events are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) are often used to treat both viral infections and leukemia relapses after transplantation but are associated with potentially life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Adoptive immunotherapy with virus-specific cytotoxic effector T cells (CTLs) derived from seropositive donors can rapidly reconstitute antiviral immunity after HSCT and organ transplantation. Therefore, it can effectively prevent the clinical manifestation of these viruses with no significant acute toxicity or increased risk of GvHD. In conditions, where patients receiving an allogeneic cord blood (CB) transplant or a transplant from a virus-seronegative donor and since donor blood is generally not available for solid organ recipients, allogeneic third party T-cell donors would offer an alternative option. Recent studies showed that during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization, the functional activity of antiviral memory T cells is impaired for a long period. This finding suggests that even stem cell donors may not be the best source of T cells. Under these circumstances, partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched virus-specific CTLs from healthy seropositive individuals may be a promising option. Therefore, frequency assessments of virus-specific memory T cells in HLA-typed healthy donors as well as in HSCT/SOT donors using a high throughput T-cell assay were performed over a period of 4 years at Hannover Medical School. This chapter will address the relevance and potential of a third-party T-cell donor registry and will discuss its clinical implication for adoptive T-cell immunotherapy.",,"['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'T-cell therapy', 'adenovirus', 'adoptive immunotherapy', 'antiviral T lymphocytes', 'cytomegalovirus']",,PMC3556568,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: On basis of the criteria of data quality from NCCR, data submitted from 104 registries were checked and evaluated. There were 72 registries' data qualified and accepted for cancer registry annual report in 2012. Descriptive analysis included incidence and mortality stratified by area (urban/rural), sex, age group and cancer site. The top 10 common cancers in different groups, proportion and cumulative rates were also calculated. Chinese population census in 1982 and Segi's population were used for age-standardized incidence/mortality rates. RESULTS: All 72 cancer registries covered a total of 85,470,522 population (57,489,009 in urban and 27,981,513 in rural areas). The total new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The morphology verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of incident cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence rate in Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (males 317.97/100,000, females 253.09/100,000), age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) of 22.08%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC were 303.39/100,000 and 150.31/100,000 in urban areas whereas in rural areas, they were 249.98/100,000 and 139.68/100,000, respectively. The cancer mortality in Chinese cancer registration areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females), age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000, and the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) was 12.94%. The cancer mortality and ASMRC were 181.86/100,000 and 80.86/100,000 in urban areas, whereas in rural areas, they were 177.83/100,000 and 94.40/100,000 respectively. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer and cervical cancer, were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases in urban and rural areas. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer spectrum showed difference between urban and rural areas, males and females. The main cancers in rural areas were cancers of the stomach, followed by esophageal cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer, whereas the main cancer in urban areas was lung cancer, followed by liver cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The coverage of cancer registration population has been increasing and data quality is improving. As the basis of cancer control program, cancer registry plays an important role in making anti-cancer strategy in medium and long term. As cancer burdens are different between urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control should be implemented based on practical situation.",,"['National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Center, Beijing 100021, China;']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer registry', 'China', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'mortality']",,PMC3555299,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of this study was to develop a new CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) in a large series of 558 patients with CMML (training cohort, Spanish Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and to validate it in an independent series of 274 patients (validation cohort, Heinrich Heine University Hospital, Dusseldorf, Germany, and San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy). The most relevant variables for overall survival (OS) and evolution to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were FAB and WHO CMML subtypes, CMML-specific cytogenetic risk classification, and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependency. CPSS was able to segregate patients into 4 clearly different risk groups for OS (P < .001) and risk of AML evolution (P < .001) and its predictive capability was confirmed in the validation cohort. An alternative CPSS with hemoglobin instead of RBC transfusion dependency offered almost identical prognostic capability. This study confirms the prognostic impact of FAB and WHO subtypes, recognizes the importance of RBC transfusion dependency and cytogenetics, and offers a simple and powerful CPSS for accurately assessing prognosis and planning therapy in patients with CMML.",,"['Spanish MDS Cooperative Group, and Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 1.,"The progression of a tumor from benign to malign and localized to invasive and metastatic growth is the major cause of poor outcome of therapy in cancer patients. The deposition of fibrin along with other pro-coagulant molecules into the extracellular matrix obviously serves as a scaffold to support proliferation, migration and tumor cell growth as well as protection against the immune system. The use of antibodies as agents for the immunodetection of fibrin deposits in vivo has been hampered by anti-fibrin cross-reactivities with fibrinogen. For the immunohistochemical detection of fibrin we used highly specific monoclonal antibodies to a synthetic fibrinunique peptide, because the fibrin molecule shares many epitopes with fibrinogen. The monoclonal antibody was applied to adenocarcinoma of colon, mamma, pancreas, sarcoma and acute myeloic leukemia. In all tissue sections and cytospin preparations fibrin was identified in a direct apposition to the surface membranes of carcinoma and sarcoma cells, predominantly at the host-tumor interface and also in regions directly adjacent to zones of angiogenesis, whereas normal cells and tissue showed no deposits of fibrin. The findings will be supported by investigations that factors and components of the coagulation system could be detected in the tumor stroma and tumor cells. These factors are obviously produced and secreted by the malignant cells and deposited together with fibrinogen into the extracellular matrix. Our results show that basically all malignant cells examined, independently of ectodermal or mesenchymal derivation, themselves are the origin of hypercoagulability and fibrinolytic system inhibition.",,"['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Betriebsarztliche Untersuchungsstelle, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany. mail@fritz-schardt.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 31.,"Our laboratory has previously shown that some gefitinib-insensitive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines exhibit dominant autocrine fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling. Herein, we deployed a whole-genome loss-of-function screen to identify genes whose knockdown potentiated the inhibitory effect of the FGFR inhibitor, AZ8010, in HNSCC cell lines. Three HNSCC cell lines expressing a genome-wide small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library were treated with AZ8010 and the abundance of shRNA sequences was assessed by deep sequencing. Under-represented shRNAs in treated cells are expected to target genes important for survival with AZ8010 treatment. Synthetic lethal hits were validated with specific inhibitors and independent shRNAs. We found that multiple alternate receptors provided protection from FGFR inhibition, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET). We showed that specific knockdown of either ERBB2 or MET in combination with FGFR inhibition led to increased inhibition of growth relative to FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment alone. These results were confirmed using specific small molecule inhibitors of either ERBB family members or MET. Moreover, the triple combination of FGFR, MET, and ERBB family inhibitors showed the largest inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis compared with the double combinations. These results reveal a role for alternate RTKs in maintaining progrowth and survival signaling in HNSCC cells in the setting of FGFR inhibition. Thus, improved therapies for HNSCC patients could involve rationally designed combinations of TKIs targeting FGFR, ERBB family members, and MET.",,"['Department of Craniofacial Biology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA. katherine.singleton@ucdenver.edu']",,,,,,,"['P50 CA058187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX001994/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01-CA127105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3608435,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We updated a previously reported cohort of lower-risk MDS patients treated with ESA and analyzed outcomes after ESA failure. In 120 patients with primary resistance and 66 patients with relapse after an initial response to ESA, the 5-year cumulative incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after failure was 18.9% and 11.6%, respectively (P=0.20). Median overall survival (OS) after failure was 40.1 and 44.9 months (P=0.35), respectively. We further categorized patients as 'early failures' (including resistance and relapse after <6 months of response), or 'later failures' (that is, relapse after >/=6 months). The 5-year cumulative incidence of AML and median OS after failure in early and later failure were 21.6% and 9% (P=0.02) and 36.7 and 54.3 months (P=0.02), respectively. Early failure to ESA and a baseline diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1 were independent prognostic factors for AML progression and, along with trisomy 8, for shorter OS. Median OS from treatment onset was 40, 90.7 and 65.8 months in early failure, later failure and no relapse, respectively (P=0.001).

Interestingly, TR120 was more potent than imatinib in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in both BCR-ABL-expressing K562 and KCL22 cells. Moreover, it showed antitumor activity in imatinib-resistant K562-R and KCL22-R cells at concentrations similar to those active in the respective sensitive cells. Further, TR120 induced a marked decrease in signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) expression in K562 cells. Consistent with this effect, it determined a block of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, a decrease in the level of cyclin D1, and a reduction in Bcl-xL expression; however, it did not cause modifications in the Bcl-2 level. Of interest, TR120 had synergistic effects when used in combination with imatinib in both sensitive and resistant cells. Considering that STAT5 is a BCR-ABL molecular target that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of CML as well as in BCR-ABL-mediated resistance to apoptosis, TR120 could potentially be a useful novel agent in the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.",,"['Department of Biomedical Internal and Specialized Medicine, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 28.,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) comprises a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane. MMPs are involved in solid and hematological malignancy through modification of cell growth, activation of cancer cells and modulation of immune functions. Several polymorphisms of different MMPs such as MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G), MMP-2 (-1306 C/T), MMP-3 (-1171 5A/6A) & MMP-9 (-1562 C/T) and their expression levels have been well documented in different types of solid cancer. These polymorphic variations were found to be associated with angiogenesis, cancer progression, invasion and metastasis. There is paucity of data available in the field of hematological malignancies. Hence the field of matrix biology of hematological malignancies is an area of active exploration. A number of MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) have been developed for the cancer treatment. The most extensively studied classes of MMP inhibitors include Batimastat, Marismastat, Salimatat, Prinomastat and Tanomastat. However, their efficacy and action have not been confirmed and more data is required. The application of one or more selective targeted MMPIs in combination with conventional anti-leukemic treatment may represent a positive approach in combat against hematopoietic malignancies. Balance of MMPs and TIMPs is altered in different malignancies and biochemical pathways. These alternations will add another dimension in the matrix biology of both solid tumor and leukemia. MMP and TIMP singly and in combination are increasingly being recognized as an important player in basic cellular biology. Exploration and exploitation of MMP and TIMP balance in various malignant and nonmalignant lesions is going to be one of the most interesting facets of future use of this system for human health care.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Detection of minor clones or minimal residual clones with ITD mutations is desirable, but is challenging when the mutant signal determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis is weak. In this study, we applied delta-PCR, which is a triple-primer strategy, to ensure PCR specificity and improve the sensitivity to 0.1% leukemic cells with ITD mutation. We also applied a reference peak to calculate ITD allelic burdens of <2% threshold of technical limitation for evaluating the relative ratio of 2 signals by capillary electrophoresis. Delta-PCR was able to detect single or multiple ITD mutations with an allelic burden (peak height ratio of mutant allele and wild-type allele) ranging from 0.4% to >100% among all 31 cases with previous documented ITD mutations. In one of the 3 cases with previously reported negative ITD mutation in the initial diagnostic specimen and ITD-positive results in the follow-up specimens, an ITD of 0.04% allele burden was retrospectively detected in the initial diagnosis specimen using delta-PCR. We also demonstrated that minor ITD mutant clones with an allelic burden of <1% present at diagnosis may become a dominant clone at the later refractory status, suggesting that detection of leukemic clones with allelic burdens of <1% may be clinically significant.

An accurate diagnosis of APL is critical for appropriate choice of therapy and prognostic assessment. Cryptic and variant rearrangements in APL are discoverable by a variety of molecular methods including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or gene sequencing. Rare reports of FISH-negative APL harboring cryptic rearrangements of PML-RARA detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or sequencing have been described. Here, we describe the detection of cryptic or variant PML-RARA rearrangements by translocation-based comparative genomic hybridization (tCGH), a recently described modification of traditional CGH technology that facilitates the detection of balanced translocations by means of the linear amplification of a potential translocation breakpoint region(s), in 2 unusual cases of APL. One tumor lacked detectable t(15;17) by karyotype and FISH, and the other tumor lacked the typical morphologic and immunophenotypic features of APL and had a variant 3-way translocation involving PML and RARA.

Cytotoxicity of tanshinone IIA was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Our data demonstrate that tanshinone IIA induced apoptosis by increasing the sub-G1 DNA contents and DNA fragmentation in KBM-5 CML cell line. In addition, tanshinone IIA significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activated caspase-3 and 9, indicating mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by tanshinone IIA. Tanshinone IIA attenuated expression of several apoptosis-related proteins such as c-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) 2, Mcl-1(L) and Bcl-2. Interestingly, although tanshinone IIA notably enhanced the phosphorylation of both c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38, JNK inhibitor, but not p38 inhibitor, reversed tanshinone IIA-induced apoptosis.

Epub 2013 Jan 28.,"TNFalpha can promote either cell survival or cell death. The activation of NF-kappaB plays a central role in cell survival while its inhibition makes TNFalpha-triggered cytotoxicity possible. Here, we report that the overexpression of a non-degradable mutant of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (super-repressor (SR)-IkappaBalpha) sensitizes HeLa cells towards TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, involving caspases activation and cytocrome C release from the mitochondria. Interestingly, we describe that the specific knockdown of Bcl-xL, but not that of Bcl-2, Bcl-w or Mcl-1, renders cells sensitive to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. This cytotoxic effect occurs without altering the activation of NF-kappaB. Then, the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway is not sufficient to protect Bcl-xL-downregulated cells from TNFalpha-induced cell death, meaning that TNFalpha is not able to promote cell survival in the absence of Bcl-xL. In addition, Bcl-xL silencing does not potentiate the cytotoxicity afforded by the cytokine in SR-IkappaBalpha-overexpressing cells. This indicates that TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in SR-IkappaBalpha-overexpressing cells relies on the protein levels of Bcl-xL. We have corroborated these findings using RD and DU-145 cells, which also become sensitive to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis after Bcl-xL knockdown despite that NF-kappaB remains activated. Altogether, our results point out that the impairment of the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL should make cells sensitive towards external insults circumventing the TNFalpha-triggered NF-kappaB-mediated cytoprotective effect. Hence, the specific inhibition of Bcl-xL could be envisaged as a promising alternative strategy against NF-kappaB-dependent highly chemoresistant proliferative malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The restriction requires an interaction between the viral capsid lattice and the B30.2/SPRY domain of TRIM5alpha. Previously, we determined that two SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) present in the B30.2/SPRY domain of human TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha) were important for the restriction of N-tropic Murine Leukemia Virus. Here, we examined whether SUMO expression and the SIM1 and SIM2 motifs in rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha (rhTRIM5alpha) are similarly important for Human Immunodeficiency Type 1 (HIV-) restriction. RESULTS: We found that mutation of SIM1 and SIM2 of rhTRIM5alpha abolished the restriction of HIV-1 virus. Further, knockdown of SUMO-1 in rhTRIM5alpha expressing cells abolished restriction of HIV-1. These results may be due, in part, to the ability of SUMO-1 to stabilize rhTRIM5alpha protein expression, as SUMO-1 knockdown increased rhTRIM5alpha turnover and the mutations in SIM1 and SIM2 led to more rapid degradation than the wild type protein. The NF-kappaB signaling ability of rhTRIM5alpha was also attenuated by SUMO-1 knockdown. Finally, upon inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export with Leptomycin B (LMB), wild type rhTRIM5alpha localized to SUMO-1 bodies in the nucleus, while the SIM1 and SIM2 mutants did not localize to SUMO-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the rhTRIM5alpha B30.2/SPRY domain is not only important for the recognition of the HIV-1 CA, but it is also important for its association with SUMO-1 or SUMO-1 modified proteins. These interactions help to maintain TRIM5alpha protein levels and its nuclear localization into specific nuclear bodies.",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 AI093258/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC3599732,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because this epigenetic change is reversible, it is a good target for 5-AZA-CdR therapy. We have reviewed the preclinical data of 5-AZA-CdR to analyze the concentrations and exposure times required to eradicate cancer stem cells. We analyzed the dose-schedules used in animal models that show potent antineoplastic activity of 5-AZA-CdR. We attempted to correlate the preclinical data with the responses obtained in clinical trials of 5-AZA-CdR in patients with cancer. The pharmacokinetics and drug distribution of 5-AZA-CdR are key parameters because adequate therapeutic drug levels are required to eliminate cancer stem cells in all anatomic compartments. The plasma half-life of 5-AZA-CdR in humans is approximately 20 minutes due to the high levels in the liver of cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that inactivates this analogue. This provides a rationale to use an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase in combination with 5-AZA-CdR. Low-dose 5-AZA-CdR is effective for MDS and AML and can induce complete remissions (CR). However, maintenance of CR with low-dose 5-AZA-CdR is difficult. Based on analyses of preclinical and clinical data, low dose 5-AZA-CdR has the potential to be an effective form of therapy in some patients with cancer. For patients who do not respond to low dose therapy we recommend dose-intensive treatment with 5-AZA-CdR. Patients who are candidates for intensive dose 5-AZA-CdR should have a good bone marrow status so as to permit adequate recovery from myelosuppression, the major toxicity of 5-AZA-CdR. Solid tumors are also interesting targets for therapy with 5-AZA-CdR. Both low dose and intensive therapy with 5-AZA-CdR can reduce the proliferative potential of tumor stem cells in animal models. We propose novel dose schedules of 5-AZA-CdR for investigation in patients with cancer. The full chemotherapeutic potential of 5-AZA-CdR to treat cancer merits further clinical investigation and can only be realized when its optimal dose-schedule is determined.",,"['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. richard.l.momparler@umontreal.ca.']",,,,,,,,PMC3570332,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such translocation typically results in a MYC-IGH@ fusion subsequently deregulating and overexpressing MYC on der 14q32. In CLL, atypical rearrangements resulting in its gain or loss, within or outside of IGH@ or MYC locus, have been reported, but their clinical significance remains uncertain. Herein, we report a 67 year-old male with complex cytogenetic findings of apparently balanced t(8;14) and unreported complex rearrangements of IGH@ and MYC loci. His clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features were consistent with the diagnosis of CLL.Interphase FISH studies revealed deletions of 11q22.3 and 13q14.3, and an extra copy of IGH@, indicative of rearrangement. Karyotype analysis showed an apparently balanced t(8;14)(q24.1;q32). Sequential GPG-metaphase FISH studies revealed abnormal signal patterns: rearrangement of IGH break apart probe with the 5'-IGH@ on derivative 8q24.1 and the 3'-IGH@ retained on der 14q; absence of MYC break apart-specific signal on der 8q; and, the presence of unsplit 5'-MYC-3' break apart probe signals on der 14q. The breakpoint on 8q24.1 was found to be at least 400 Kb upstream of 5' of MYC. In addition, FISH studies revealed two abnormal clones; one with 13q14.3 deletion, and the other, with concurrent 11q deletion and atypical rearrangements. Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) detected a 7.1 Mb deletion on 11q22.3-q23.3 including ATM, a finding consistent with FISH results. While no significant copy number gain or loss observed on chromosomes 8, 12 and 13, a 455 Kb microdeletion of uncertain clinical significance was detected on 14q32.33. Immunohistochemistry showed co-expression of CD19, CD5, and CD23, positive ZAP-70 expression and absence of MYC expression. Overall findings reveal an apparently balanced t(8;14) and atypical complex rearrangements involving 3'-IGH@ and a breakpoint at least 400 Kb upstream of MYC, resulting in the relocation of the intact 5'-MYC-3' from der 8q, and apposition to 3'-IGH@ at der 14q. This case report provides unique and additional cytogenetic data that may be of clinical significance in such a rare finding in CLL. It also highlights the utility of conventional and sequential metaphase FISH in understanding complex chromosome anomalies and their association with other clinical findings in patients with CLL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLL reported case with such an atypical rearrangement in a patient with a negative MYC expression.",,"['Clinical Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Cytogenetics, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Clinical Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Medicine, David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",,,,,,,,PMC3599416,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proven, probable and possible episodes were considered as the disease group. One hundred febrile episodes in 78 patients were evaluated. The mean age was 6.1 years. Majority (75%) episodes were in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. One episode each was diagnosed with proven and probable IA, while 23 were diagnosed with possible IA. Best results were obtained with a cut-off value of 1.0, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 60%, 93%, 75 and 87 respectively. The sensitivity dropped to 40%, at cut-off value of 1.5 and specificity was 38%, at a cut-off of 0.5. A higher value of GM correlated with pulmonary nodules (P = 0.037) and mortality (P = 0.001).

Epub 2013 Mar 4.,"We previously reported that (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (FDG-PET) is almost universally positive in patients with T cell lymphoma. In the present analysis we examined the impact of FDG-PET on the initial staging of peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs), and the prognostic value of interim FDG-PET. This retrospective analysis identified patients with mature T or natural killer (NK) lymphomas who had PET scans as part of initial staging or staging at relapse [(n = 95) (staging cohort)] in the PTCL database at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A subset of these patients had repeat PET for interim restaging during initial therapy with curative intent [(n = 50) (interim restaging cohort)]. The frequency of specific T cell histologies included in this analysis were: PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 35); angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) (n = 17); anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK-1+ (n = 11) and ALK-1- (n = 12); adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) (n = 7); NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) (n = 10); and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL) (n = 3). In the staging cohort, 77 patients were newly diagnosed, and 18 had relapsed disease. Pretreatment FDG-PET was positive in 96% of patients. PET identified additional disease sites in 47/95 patients (50%) when added to conventional staging. Most frequently identified additional sites were: other nodal (n = 24); bone (n = 10); skin (n = 8); nasopharynx (n = 4); spleen (n = 3); and lung (n = 2). However, FDG-PET modified computed tomography (CT)-based staging in only 5/95 patients (5.2%): two patients were upstaged and three patients were downstaged. FDG-PET-based staging did not alter planned treatment for any patient. Interim restaging with PET was performed after a median of 4 cycles of chemotherapy. In this cohort, treatment regimens included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone CHOP (n = 19); CHOP/ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) (n = 26); and other (n = 7). Subsequently, 29 patients were consolidated with either autologous (n = 22) or allogeneic (n = 7) stem cell transplant. After a median follow-up of 3.4 years for surviving patients, those with negative interim PET had superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients with positive interim PET (p = 0.03). There were no differences in overall survival (OS). In PTCL, FDG-PET commonly identifies additional sites of disease but infrequently impacts CT-based staging and does not influence therapy. Interim FDG-PET may predict for PFS. FDG-PET should be integrated into prospective trials to confirm these findings.",,"['Lymphoma Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , New York, NY , USA.']",,,,,,,"['R25 CA020449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000457/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3915724,['NIHMS537111'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By using light and fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, DNA fragmentation analysis, and pharmacological inhibition, we provide evidence that 2 pathways of cell death induced by glucose-starvation (GS)/oxidative stress (OS) run in parallel: apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-dependent and caspase-3 dependent mechanisms. However, the supremacy of 1 pathway over the other one relies on the availability of glucose, which is essential for the proper functioning of antioxidant cellular systems. It is shown that GS generates superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-))/hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which are linked to the death ~45%-70% cells by AIF/mitochondria depolarization/chromatin condensation pathway and ~15%-30% death by nuclear factor-kappa B/p53/c-Jun/c-Jun N-terminal kinase /mitochondria depolarization/caspase-3 activation/DNA fragmentation mechanism at 24-48 h. Remarkably, chromatin condensation/nuclei fragmentation appeared to occur partially independent of the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and plasma membrane damage. Interestingly, signaling inhibitors, antioxidants, or glucose protected cells if added immediately to culture devoid of glucose (P < 0.001), but only vitamin E and glucose significantly rescued cells at 3 h of GS compared to control. Taken together these data suggest that glucose deprivation might efficiently eliminate leukemia cells via apoptosis.",,"['School of Medicine, Medical Research Institute, University of Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were enrolled. Statistically significant differences were found in neutrophil count, Hb, LDH, IgA and C4 values, ANA, anti-EA EBV IgG and anti-CMV IgG titres. High LDH value and anti-CMV IgG were the most predictive factors for neoplasia. High specificity factors for neoplasia were abnormal values of neutrophil count, Hb, IgA and C4, and the presence of anti-EA EBV and anti-CMV IgG. High PPV were recorded for abnormal neutrophil count, Hb value and anti-CMV titre. A low NPV was found only for anti-EA EBV and anti-CMV titres. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting of patients, minimum changes in neutrophil count, particularly if associated with low Hb and high LDH levels, are to be thoroughly considered, because they appear as the most predictive factors for the diagnosis of tumour.",,"['Department GF Ingrassia, University of Catania, Via Santa Sofia 87, Catania 95123, Italy.']",,,,,,,,PMC3563449,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall survival (OS) was 43.4% at 1 year, and 16.3% at 5 years from relapse in patients who received chemotherapy alone in CR1. Among patients who relapsed after chemotherapy alone in CR1, 123 (52.5%) achieved a second remission (CR2) following salvage chemotherapy, of whom 62 subsequently underwent Allo-HSCT during CR2. Allo-HSCT in CR2 was significantly associated with better OS. Moreover, the type of salvage chemotherapy influenced OS from relapse. A doxorubicin, vincristine, and predonisone-based (AdVP-type) regimen was related to better OS in patients with longer CR1 (more than 1 year), but was related to worse OS in patients with shorter CR1. In conclusion, the prognosis of patients with relapsed Ph-negative ALL is poor. Allo-HSCT after a first relapse could improve the prognosis. Selection of the optimal salvage chemotherapy might depend on the duration of CR1.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Division of Haematology, Saitama Medical Centre, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present review is focused on the role of the current CADD methodologies for the discovery of anti-Lkms agents with strong emphasis on the in silico prediction of inhibitors against the primary protein associated with the appearance of Lkms: Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1 (TPK-ABL1). In order to make a contribution to the field, we also developed a unified ligand-based approach by exploring Quantitative-Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) studies. Here, we focused on the construction of two multi-targets (mt) QSAR models by employing a large and heterogeneous database of compounds. These models exhibited excellent statistical quality and predictive power to classifying more than 92% of inhibitors/ no inhibitors against seven proteins associated with Lkms, in both training and prediction sets. By using our unified ligand-based approach we identified several fragments as responsible for the anti-Lkms activity through inhibition of proteins, and new molecules were suggested as versatile inhibitors of the seven proteins under study.",,"['REQUIMTE/Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Porto, 4169-007 Porto, Portugal. alejspivanovich@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"Rapidly growing tumor cells require a nutrient-rich environment in order to thrive, therefore, restricting access to certain key amino acids, such as arginine, often results in the death of malignant cells, which frequently display defective cell cycle check-point control. Healthy cells, by contrast, become quiescent and remain viable under arginine restriction, displaying full recovery upon return to arginine-rich conditions. The use of arginase therapy to restrict available arginine for selectively targeting malignant cells is currently under investigation in human clinical trials. However, the suitability of this approach for veterinary uses is unexplored. As a prelude to in vivo studies in canine malignancies, we examined the in vitro effects of arginine-deprivation on canine lymphoid and osteosarcoma cell lines. Two lymphoid and 2 osteosarcoma cell lines were unable to recover following 6 days of arginine deprivation, but all remaining cell lines displayed full recovery upon return to arginine-rich culture conditions. These remaining cell lines all proved susceptible to cell death following the addition of arginase to the cultures. The lymphoid lines were particularly sensitive to arginase, becoming unrecoverable after just 3 days of treatment. Two of the osteosarcoma lines were also susceptible over this time-frame; however the other 3 lines required 6-8 days of arginase treatment to prevent recovery. In contrast, adult progenitor cells from the bone marrow of a healthy dog were able to recover fully following 9 days of culture in arginase. Over 3 days in culture, arginase was more effective than asparaginase in inducing the death of lymphoid lines. These results strongly suggest that short-term arginase treatment warrants further investigation as a therapy for lymphoid malignancies and osteosarcomas in dogs.",,"['Center for Advanced Orthopaedic Studies, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America. j.wells3@uq.edu.au']",,,,,,,,PMC3554772,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been attributed to leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which occupy endosteal and sinusoidal niches in the bone marrow similar to those of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The signals from these niches provide a viable setting for the maintenance, survival, and fate specifications of these stem cells.

This implies waiting for laboratory tests and therefore a delay in initiation of chemotherapy. We studied the impact of time from diagnosis to treatment (TDT) on overall survival, early death, and response rate in a retrospective series of 599 newly diagnosed AML patients treated by induction chemotherapy between 2000 and 2009. The effect of TDT was assessed using multivariate analysis. TDT was analyzed as a continuous variable using a specific polynomial function to model the shape and form of the relationship. The median TDT was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16) and was significantly longer in patients with a white blood cell count (WBC) <50 Giga per liter (G/L) (P < .0001) and in older patients (P = .0004). In multivariate analysis, TDT had no impact on overall survival (P = .4095) compared with age >60 years, secondary AML, WBC >50 G/L, European LeukemiaNet risk groups, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Furthermore, TDT was not associated with response rate and early death. Thus, waiting a short period of time for laboratory tests to characterize leukemias better and design adapted therapeutic strategies at diagnosis seems possible.",,"[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nineteen gene mutations, including 8 class I genes, 4 class II genes, WT1 and TP53 (class III), and 5 epigenetic regulator genes (class IV), were analyzed in 206 children with de novo AML. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assay followed by direct sequencing. One hundred seventeen of 206 patients (56.8%) had at least one mutation: 51% class I, 13% class II, 6.8% class III, and 5.6% class IV. FLT3-internal tandem duplication was most frequent, and 29% of patients had more than one gene mutation. Two patients carried ASXL1 mutations, both with t(8;21), 2 had DNMT3A mutations, 2 had IDH1 mutations, 1 had IDH2 mutation, and 3 had TET2 mutations. Both patients with IDH1 mutations had AML-M0 subtype and MLL-partial tandem duplication. Cooperating mutations with mutated epigenetic regulators were observed in 8 of 10 patients.

Epub 2013 Jan 30.,"Simian retrovirus type 4 (SRV-4), a simian type D retrovirus, naturally infects cynomolgus monkeys, usually without apparent symptoms. However, some infected monkeys presented with an immunosuppressive syndrome resembling that induced by simian immunodeficiency virus infection. Antiretrovirals with inhibitory activity against SRV-4 are considered to be promising agents to combat SRV-4 infection. However, although some antiretrovirals have been reported to have inhibitory activity against SRV-1 and SRV-2, inhibitors with anti-SRV-4 activity have not yet been studied. In this study, we identified antiretroviral agents with anti-SRV-4 activity from a panel of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs using a robust in vitro luciferase reporter assay. Among these, two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (AZT) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), potently inhibited SRV-4 infection within a submicromolar to nanomolar range, which was similar to or higher than the activities against HIV-1, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. In contrast, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors did not exhibit any activities against SRV-4. Although both AZT and TDF effectively inhibited cell-free SRV-4 transmission, they exhibited only partial inhibitory activities against cell-to-cell transmission. Importantly, one HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor, raltegravir (RAL), potently inhibited single-round infection as well as cell-free and cell-to-cell SRV-4 transmission. These findings indicate that viral expansion routes impact the inhibitory activity of antiretrovirals against SRV-4, while only RAL is effective in suppressing both the initial SRV-4 infection and subsequent SRV-4 replication.",,"['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",,,,,,,,PMC3624392,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 30.,"The possible therapeutic benefits of B-cell depletion in combating tumoral immune escape have been debated. In support of this concept, metastasis of highly aggressive 4T1 breast cancer cells in mice can be abrogated by inactivation of tumor-evoked regulatory B cells (tBreg). Here, we report the unexpected finding that B-cell depletion by CD20 antibody will greatly enhance cancer progression and metastasis. Both murine and human tBregs express low levels of CD20 and, as such, anti-CD20 mostly enriches for these cells. In the 4T1 model of murine breast cancer, this effect of enriching for tBregs suggests that B-cell depletion by anti-CD20 may not be beneficial at all in some cancers. In contrast, we show that in vivo-targeted stimulation of B cells with CXCL13-coupled CpG oligonucleotides (CpG-ODN) can block cancer metastasis by inhibiting CD20(Low) tBregs. Mechanistic investigations suggested that CpG-ODN upregulates low surface levels of 4-1BBL on tBregs to elicit granzyme B-expressing cytolytic CD8(+) T cells, offering some explanative power for the effect. These findings underscore the immunotherapeutic importance of tBreg inactivation as a strategy to enhance cancer therapy by targeting both the regulatory and activating arms of the immune system in vivo.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Immunotherapeutic Section, National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",,,,,,,['ZIA AG000443-05/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3618504,['NIHMS441371'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of TREM-1 in monocyte fate and the detailed molecular mechanisms evoked by TREM-1 are unknown. METHODS: Adenoviruses overexpressing TREM-1 were constructed and transfected into a monocytic cell line. After activation of TREM-1 by agonist antibody with or without lipopolysaccharide, apoptosis was induced and assayed using flow cytometry. The signaling pathways downstream of TREM-1 were illustrated by inhibitory experiments. Proapoptotic/antiapoptotic protein levels were measured using immunoblot. In addition, the relationship between the expression levels of TREM-1 in monocytes and the magnitude of monocyte apoptosis were analyzed in septic patients. RESULTS: Activation of TREM-1 protected monocytes from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. This characteristic was also obtained under lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The protection of TREM-1 against monocyte apoptosis was abrogated after inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue signaling. Cross-linking of TREM-1 remarkably up-regulated myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein level, and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue resulted in the reduction of myeloid cell leukemia-1 expression. Inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia-1 abolished the antiapoptotic effect of TREM-1. Furthermore, in septic patients, TREM-1 levels were inversely correlated to the magnitude of apoptosis in monocyte. CONCLUSIONS: TREM-1 played an important role in apoptosis in monocytes. Activation of TREM-1 protected monocytic cells from apoptosis through activation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue pathways and increased expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein. These findings provide a novel additional mechanism for TREM-1-mediated hyperinflammatory response in monocytes.",,"[""Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 30.,"Glomerular lesions have been recognized in a number of malignant diseases. Membranous nephropathy is the most common glomerular pathology associated with solid tumors. In Hodgkin's disease, the most common lesion is minimal change disease, reflecting possibly an anomaly of T-cell function. On the other hand, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a large proportion of glomerular lesions fall into the category of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Membranous nephropathy is also the most common glomerular disease seen following stem cell transplantation, suggesting a possible immune-mediated mechanism. Chemotherapy agents such as interferon, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and bisphosphonates have also been associated with various glomerular diseases and thrombotic microangiopathy. Failure to recognize certain paraneoplastic glomerular diseases can lead to potentially unnecessary therapies. This review describes the association of glomerular diseases with solid tumors, hematological malignancies, stem cell transplantation, and chemotherapeutic agents. We also describe the pitfalls in diagnosis and the dilemma in treating these entities.",,"['Division of Kidney Diseases and Hypertension, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, Great Neck, New York 11021, USA. kdj200@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Kidney Int. 2014 Jan;85(1):213-4.

Yet, no study specifically evaluated outcomes in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for septic shock of pulmonary origin. This is a multicenter cohort study of cancer patients admitted to the ICU for septic shock and pneumonia between 1998 and 2008. Independent determinants of hospital mortality were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Prognostic impact of persistence or acquisition of organ failures was evaluated by survival conditional probabilities. During the 10-year study period, 218 patients were included. Hematologic malignancy (mostly non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute leukemia) affected 84%, and solid tumors (mostly lung cancer) affected 16% of patients. Chemotherapy was recently administered in 89% of patients, and 24.5% of patients were recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (35 autologous, 18 allogeneic). At the time of ICU admission, 60% of patients were in partial or complete remission. All patients received vasopressors; invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was needed in 78.4% and dialysis in 30% of patients. Intensive care unit and hospital mortality rates were 56.4% and 62.4%, respectively. Independent risk factors for hospital mortality were age older than 60 years, time between first symptoms and ICU admission, use of invasive MV, need for invasive MV after use of noninvasive ventilation, and coma. Analysis of survival probability showed that there was no temporal threshold after which persistence or gain of organ dysfunction indicated no hope for survival. Survival in cancer patients with septic shock from pulmonary origin is substantial, even when organ dysfunctions are not rapidly reversible. Delayed ICU management is an independent predictor of death.

The efficacy and optimal approach of VTE prevention are unclear, particularly in adult patients. We assessed the effect of thromboprophylaxis on symptomatic VTE incidence in cycle 1 of ALL treatment in adult patients. Secondly, we explored potential etiologic factors for VTE and the clinical impact of VTE on ALL outcome. We retrospectively assessed symptomatic VTE incidence and use of thromboprophylaxis in 240 adults treated for newly diagnosed ALL in the Dutch-Belgian HOVON-37 multicentre study (1999-2005). Potential etiologic factors were explored by analysis of patient and disease characteristics, impact of VTE on ALL outcome by analysis of complete remission and overall survival rates. Symptomatic VTE was observed in 24 of 240 patients (10%). Thromboprophylaxis differed by centre (prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP) supplementation or no thromboprophylaxis) and was applied only during L-asparaginase in cycle 1. VTE incidence was significantly lower with FFP supplementation than without FFP (6% vs. 19%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.73). FFP did not influence antithrombin or fibrinogen plasma levels. Patients with VTE in cycle 1 had a significantly poorer complete remission rate (adjusted OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.07-0.50), particularly patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (adjusted OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04-0.65). Our study suggests that prophylactic FFP supplementation effectively reduces symptomatic VTE incidence during ALL treatment in adults. This should be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial.",,"['Department of Haematology, F4-224, Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660, 1100 DD Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.n.lauw@amc.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic hallmark of APL is a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 17, and the PML-RARa gene fusion is found in more than 90% of these cases. Other chromosomal abnormalities are commonly found in APL, but their clinical significance has yet to be determined. Here we report a case of childhood APL that was studied by conventional cytogenetics along with molecular cytogenetic techniques. The patient showed a complex karyotype with an unusual cytogenetic rearrangement originating from two different abnormalities in a single chromosome 6. Our case is an exceptional example of a cryptic cytogenetic anomaly in APL and underscores the importance of detailed genetic characterization.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

METHODS: 96 refractory/relapsed AL patients who received HLA-mismatched/haploidentical HSCT following conditioning regimen comprised of modified busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BU/CY) plus thymoglobulin (ATG) from Jan 2003 to Jun 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 96 patients, 61 suffered from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 35 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), all of them in non-remission (NR) or relapse before transplantation. With a median follow-up of 373 (34 - 3157) d, 33 cases (34%) survived, 31 survived without leukemia, and 35 relapsed. The estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 30.2% and 29.0%, respectively. The 3-year OS rate was significantly higher for AML patients (39.2%) than for ALL patients (15.4%) (P = 0.005). The estimated 3-year OS probabilities for patients with and without prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) were 38.0% and 11.8%, respectively (P = 0.001). Sex, age, conditioning regimen (BU/CY or not, dosage of ATG), the number of HLA mismatches between the donor and recipient, and the number of infused mononuclear cells were not independent factors affecting OS, DFS and relapse. Multivariate analysis showed that DFS rate was significantly higher in patients receiving prophylactic DLI (P = 0.003), in patients with AML (vs with ALL) (P = 0.037) and with chronic GVHD (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Haploidentical HSCT may prolong DFS in part refractory/relapsed AL patients and even cure them.

METHODS: The multidrug resistant leukemia cell lines HL-60/DNR and HL-60/VCR cells were used as models, and sensitive HL-60 cells as a control. The cytotoxicity of bortezomib on HL-60, HL-60/DNR, HL-60/VCR cells were measured by MTT method, and the non-cytotoxicity dose was determined as reversible dose. The cells were divided into 4 experimental groups: HL-60/DNR + DNR, HL-60/DNR + DNR + bortezomib, HL-60/VCR + VCR, HL-60/VCR + VCR + bortezomib. The bortezomib resistant reversal fold was calculated. The levels of XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 mRNA and proteins expression and the activation of NF-kappaB of the HL-60/DNR, HL-60/VCR cells were examined by quantitative real time RT-PCR and western blot respectively after treated with gradually increasing concentrations of bortezomib (10, 40, 80 nmol/L) for 48 hours. RESULTS: Bortezomib inhibited the cell growth of HL-60, HL-60/DNR, and HL-60/VCR in a concentration-dependent manner.

METHODS: 119 CML pts received dasatinib 100 mg once daily for pts in CP or 70 mg twice daily for pts in AP/BP. The hematologic/cytogenetic response, progression-free-survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AE) of the pts were assessed. RESULTS: 59 pts in CP, 25 in AP and 35 in BP received dasatinib treatment. The median duration of dasatinib treatment were 19.32, 20.99 and 3.22 months respectively. Complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) were achieved by 91.5%, 50.8% and 42.4% of pts in CP respectively. The median times to achieving MCyR was 12.1 weeks. None of the pts in CP achieved MCyR progressed or died till to last follow-up. CHR and major hematologic response (MaHR) were achieved by 52.0% and 84.0% of pts in AP, respectively. The median time to CHR and MaHR were 16.0 and 12.1 weeks, respectively. 10 pts in AP achieved MCyR and 9 of them were CCyR. The median duration of PFS was 25.7 months for pts in AP. For 35 pts in BP, the rates of CHR and MaHR were 17.1% and 31.4% respectively. Both of the median time to CHR and MaHR were 12.1 weeks and median time of duration of MaHR was 11.2 months. 8 pts in BP achieved MCyR and the median time of duration of MCyR was 13.2 months. The median duration of PFS and OS for the pts in BP were 4.3 and 16.7 months respectively. Grade 3-4 of hematologic AEs related to dasatinib were frequent but manageable by dose interruption/reduction or supportive care. 52.5% and 61.0% of pts in CP experienced grade 3-4 of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. More than 80% pts in AP/BP occurred grade 3-4 cytopenia. The common non-hematologic AEs related to dasatinib were including grade 1-2 pleural effusion, headache, pneumonia and diarrhea. The frequency of non-hematologic AE was higher in pts with AP/BP than in pts with CP. CONCLUSION: Chinese pts with CML resistant or intolerant to IM treated by dasatinib can achieve relatively sustained hematologic and even cytogenetic remission and are well tolerated.",,"[""Peking University Institute of Hematology and People's Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, treatment success is directly related to good long-term adherence. Adherence to TKI therapy was evaluated in 137 CML patients over a period of 1 year. Three different methods were used to evaluate adherence: the Morisky questionnaire, a medication diary and the medication possession ratio (MPR). MPR was the most effective method of assessing adherence (median adherence 96.5%; p = 0.0001), duration of TKI treatment was the variable that most impacted adherence (p = 0.03), and the MPR was inversely correlated to the duration of therapy. Additionally, participation in clinical trials, better quality of life as reported by patients and higher socioeconomic status were all related to better compliance (p = 0.02, 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). For patients treated with imatinib for 24-48 months (n = 22), individuals with major molecular response (MMR) had a significantly better MPR than those who failed to achieve MMR (p = 0.04). In this group, the mean MPR was 87% for the population without apparent molecular response and 96% for those achieving MMR; however, only 24% of the patients were completely adherent to TKI treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

However, investigations using fluorescence in situ hybridization, loss of heterozygosity analysis, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and, most recently, massively parallel sequencing have challenged this view. In particular, comparison of diagnostic and relapse samples, modeling in transgenic mice, and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have indicated that widespread genomic heterogeneity, which is masked by a dominant clone, may be present in AML and ALL.

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a highly effective agent for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, consecutively administered As2O3 induces serious adverse cardiac effects, including long QT syndrome (LQTs) and even sudden cardiac death. Previous studies have shown that genistein (Gen) exerts anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. The present study aimed to explore the potential protective effects of Gen on As2O3-induced adverse cardiac effects, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: A rat model of As2O3-induced QT prolongation was generated by intravenous injection with As2O3. Surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and hemodynamics were employed to assess the LQTs and cardiac function. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) were measured by confocal microscopy, and cardiomyocytes apoptosis were assessed by TUNEL assay. Western blot was applied to determine protein levels. RESULTS: We found for the first time that treatment with Gen significantly reversed LQTs and dose-dependently improved As2O3-induced impairment of cardiac function. As2O3 elevated [Ca(2+)]i and Gen mitigated this effect. Meanwhile, Gen significantly reversed As2O3-mediated cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Furthermore, Gen dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylated JNK and p38-MAPK (pp38-MAPK), and blocked Deltapsim collapse, and further decreased cleaved caspase-3. CONCLUSION: Gen protects against the adverse cardiac effects of As2O3 partly by mitigating cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by As2O3 through attenuating intracellular calcium overload and downregulating protein expression of p-JNK and pp38-MAPK to ameliorate the damage of Deltapsim leading to suppression of caspase-3 activation. Gen might be used as an adjunction therapy in APL patients receiving As2O3 treatment to avoid, at least to minimize, the adverse cardiac effects of As2O3.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Mammalian pro-survival proteins Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1 bind with varying affinities and specificities to native BH3 motifs, engineered peptides, and small molecules. Biophysical studies have determined interaction patterns for these proteins, particularly for the most-studied family members Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. Bfl-1 is a pro-survival protein implicated in preventing apoptosis in leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma. Although Bfl-1 is a promising therapeutic target, relatively little is known about its binding preferences. We explored the binding of Bfl-1 to BH3-like peptides by screening a peptide library that was designed to sample a high degree of relevant sequence diversity. Screening using yeast-surface display led to several novel high-affinity Bfl-1 binders and to thousands of putative binders identified through deep sequencing. Further screening for specificity led to identification of a peptide that bound to Bfl-1 with K(d) < 1 nM and very slow dissociation from Bfl-1 compared to other pro-survival Bcl-2 family members. A point mutation in this sequence gave a peptide with ~50 nM affinity for Bfl-1 that was selective for Bfl-1 in equilibrium binding assays.

Because of the high cost of plerixafor, it is not routinely used in all patients undergoing HPC mobilization. If cost were not an issue, an argument could be made that plerixafor could be added to every mobilization regimen, but cost is an issue so in an attempt to be more cost-effective, many centers have limited plerixafor use to patients who have failed or who are predicted to fail collection of adequate numbers of cells by other methods. Additionally, plerixafor is now under investigation both for HPC collection of healthy donors for allogeneic stem cell transplantation and as an adjunct therapy (i.e., chemosensitizing agent) for acute leukemias. This article briefly reviews the role of plerixafor in autologous and allogeneic transplantation as well as its emerging role in the treatment of acute leukemias.

A series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized, and structure-activity relationship analysis using cell- and transgenic-zebrafish-based assays led to the discovery of a number of compounds that exhibited both high potency against FLT3-driven human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) MV4-11 cells and a considerable antiangiogenic effect in transgenic-zebrafish-based assays.

Physical interactions of other cellular proteins with WT1 are known to modulate its function. We previously identified the Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein, ZNF224, as a novel human WT1-associating protein that enhances the transcriptional activation of the human vitamin D receptor promoter by WT1. Here, we have analyzed the effects of WT1-ZNF224 interaction on the expression of apoptosis-regulating genes in the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cell line. The results demonstrated that ZNF224 acts in fine tuning of WT1-dependent control of gene expression, acting as a co-activator of WT1 in the regulation of proapoptotic genes and suppressing WT1 mediated transactivation of antiapoptotitc genes. Moreover, the DNA damaging drug cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) induces expression of ZNF224 in K562 cells and this induction enhances cell apoptotic response to ara-C. These findings suggest that ZNF224 can be a mediator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells.",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study prospectively evaluated and compared the outcome and toxicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and HIV-negative patients with BL who were treated in an intensive immunochemotherapy-based and age-adapted trial. METHODS: A total of 118 adult patients (80 HIV-negative and 38 HIV-positive) aged 15 to 83 years were treated with 4 (nonbulky stages I-II) or 6 (stages II bulky, III-IV) cycles of intensive chemotherapy combined with rituximab. Reduction in chemotherapy doses and modification of the cycle schedules was performed in patients older than 55 years. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of HIV-positive patients were comparable with those who were HIV-negative. Complete remission rates were 82% and 87%, respectively, and 9 patients died in induction, 9 died in remission, and 7 relapsed. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, nonsignificant differences were observed in the 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) probabilities (77% and 63% for HIV-positive and 80% and 78% for HIV-negative patients, respectively). Young HIV-infected patients presented higher incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis and severe infectious episodes. Poor general status and bone marrow involvement, but not advanced age, were associated with a shorter OS, allowing the definition of 3 prognostic groups, with the OS ranging from 50% to 92%. CONCLUSIONS: Age-adapted intensive immunochemotherapy is highly effective in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, with a higher toxicity in the latter group. Poor general status and bone marrow involvement had a negative impact on survival.",['Copyright (c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],"[""Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain. jribera@iconcologia.net""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of the t(6;11)(q27;q23) has been linked to poor overall survival in patients with AML. In this study, we demonstrate that MLL-AF6 requires continued activity of the histone-methyltransferase DOT1L to maintain expression of the MLL-AF6-driven oncogenic gene-expression program. Using gene-expression analysis and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation studies followed by next generation sequencing, we found that MLL-fusion target genes display markedly high levels of histone 3 at lysine 79 (H3K79) dimethylation in murine MLL-AF6 leukemias as well as in ML2, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line bearing the t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation. Targeted disruption of Dot1l using a conditional knockout mouse model inhibited leukemogenesis mediated by the MLL-AF6 fusion oncogene. Moreover, both murine MLL-AF6-transformed cells as well as the human MLL-AF6-positive ML2 leukemia cell line displayed specific sensitivity to EPZ0004777, a recently described, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of Dot1l. Dot1l inhibition resulted in significantly decreased proliferation, decreased expression of MLL-AF6 target genes, and cell cycle arrest of MLL-AF6-transformed cells.

The combined perifosine/sorafenib treatment significantly inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt phosphorylation in two of the three cell lines. Profiling of the responsive cell lines revealed that perifosine/sorafenib decreased the amplitude of transcriptional signatures that are associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication and cell death. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) was identified as the main mediator of the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of perifosine/sorafenib. Combined treatment compared with single agents significantly suppressed cell growth (40-80%, P<0.001), induced severe mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptotic cell death (up to 70%, P<0.0001) in a synergistic manner. Furthermore, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor burden (P<0.0001), an increased survival time (81 vs 45 days, P<0.0001), an increased apoptosis (2- to 2.5-fold, P<0.0001) and necrosis (2- to 8-fold, P<0.0001) in perifosine/sorafenib-treated animals compared with mice receiving single agents.

However, little is known about the molecular interactions between cisplatin and flavonols. The data herein helps to elucidate this interaction. Spectrophotometric data in the UV-visible range indicates that hydroxyl groups on the B-ring of flavonols are essential for reactivity with cisplatin. The use of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring approach clearly supports the critical role played by B-ring hydroxyls in their interactions with a cisplatin-bound double-stranded DNA surface; an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring of flavonols parallels the increase in their reaction rates with cisplatin and correlates well with their reported effects on leukemia cell apoptosis efficacy. This study underscores the importance of B-ring hydroxyls in cisplatin's toxicity and may be used to better understand and improve combination therapies of flavonols with cisplatin.",,"['Department of Chemistry, Pomona College, 645 North College Avenue, Claremont, California 91711, United States.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence dye labeling has inherent constraints, most notably the upper limit of labels per cell that may be probed using a single excitation source, in addition to a physical limit to the number of broad emission spectra that can be distinctly collected within the visible wavelength region. SERS labeling has the potential to mitigate these shortfalls. Herein, antibody-targeted, PEG-coated surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) Au nanoparticles are used simultaneously to label three cell surface markers of interest on malignant B cells from the LY10 lymphoma cell line. The SERS probes were characterized by multiple methods to confirm their monodispersity and functionalization with both PEG and monoclonal antibodies. The specificity of the particles' cell labeling was demonstrated on both primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia and LY10 cells using SERS from cell suspensions and confocal Raman mapping, respectively. Fluorescence flow cytometry was employed to confirm the binding of SERS probes to LY10 over large cell populations, and the particles' SERS was collected directly from labeled cells using a commercial flow cytometer.

The pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) were intraperitoneally injected to mice in Group B. Mifepristone was subcutaneously injected to mice in Group D at 9:00 am on the 4th gestation day. Corresponding medications were given to mice in Group C, E, and F at 1.5 mL/100 g by gastrogavage at 8:00 am from the first to the 4th gestation day. Eight uterus samples were collected at 9:00 pm on the 4th gestation day and fixed. The expression levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrin beta3 were detected using immunohistochemical assay. The pregnant mice were sacrificed at 9:30 pm on the 8th gestation day, and their uterus were taken out. The number of blastocysts was counted. RESULTS: Compared with Group A, the pregnant rate was 6.67% (1/15 cases) in Group B and 18.75% (3/16 cases) in Group D, the mean OD value of LIF was 0. 18 +/- 0.02 in Group B and 0.23 +/- 0.02 in Group D, and the mean OD value of integrin beta3 was 0.20 +/- 0.05 in Group B and 0.19 +/- 0. 02 in Group D, showing statistical difference (P < 0.01).

METHODS: Nutritional risk of 99 leukemia patients was screened with NRS2002 before and after HSCT. The (chi) (2) test was applied to compare the risk differences between groups such as age, gender and matching degree, while the differences of other enumeration data, such as recent (1-3 months) weight loss, reduced food intake within one week and BMI, were compared by continuity correction. RESULTS: Of the 99 leukemia patients, 22 cases (22.2%) had nutritional risk before HSCT, while all patients had nutritional risk after HSCT; there is no significant difference in nutritional risk between male and female, and patients of less than 30 years old, not-full matched, recent (1-3 months) weight loss, reduced food intake within a week or BMI <18.5 were more likely to have nutritional risk; and 77 cases (77.8%) had weight loss, among which 49 patients (63.6%) had more than 5% weight loss within one month. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that leukemia patients should receive the nutritional risk screening conventionally before and after HSCT, and NRS2002 was only appropriate for nutritional risk screening before HSCT. More attention should be paid to the patients less than 30 years old or not-full matched.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Regional cancer center in France. PATIENTS: Forty-six patients with chronic phase CML treated with imatinib for 6 months or longer as of July 1, 2009. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed a self-assessment questionnaire consisting of 10 questions to identify patients who were nonadherent to their cancer treatment. Each answer was worth 1 point, resulting in a possible maximum score of 10. The questionnaire was validated in patients receiving imatinib, using an objective adherence evaluation: a patient's score on the self-assessment questionnaire was correlated with prescription refills, expressed as a medication possession ratio. A score of less than 8 was associated with a positive predictive value of 0.83 to have a medication possession ratio below 90%. With use of this questionnaire, half of the patients receiving imatinib would be identified as being nonadherent (sensitivity 0.5). Few adherent patients would be falsely identified as nonadherent, as the questionnaire's specificity was 0.97. CONCLUSION: This self-assessment questionnaire was validated for the first time in patients receiving imatinib for CML treatment. It provides a simple practical tool for health care professionals to assess patient adherence during their routine clinical practice and to propose targeted interventions for those identified as possibly nonadherent.","['(c) 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Department of Pharmacy, Cancer Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France. mikael.daouphars@chb.unicancer.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular function of p15Ink4b in hematopoietic differentiation still remains to be elucidated. Our previous study demonstrated that loss of p15Ink4b in mice results in skewing of the differentiation pattern of the common myeloid progenitor towards the myeloid lineage. Here, we investigated a function of p15Ink4b tumor suppressor gene in driving erythroid lineage commitment in hematopoietic progenitors. It was found that p15Ink4b is expressed more highly in committed megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors than granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. More importantly, mice lacking p15Ink4b have lower numbers of primitive red cell progenitors and a severely impaired response to 5-fluorouracil- and phenylhydrazine-induced hematopoietic stress. Introduction of p15Ink4b into multipotential progenitors produced changes at the molecular level, including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase\extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling, increase GATA-1, erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and decrease Pu1, GATA-2 expression. These changes rendered cells more permissive to erythroid commitment and less permissive to myeloid commitment, as demonstrated by an increase in early burst-forming unit-erythroid formation with concomitant decrease in myeloid colonies. Our results indicate that p15Ink4b functions in hematopoiesis, by maintaining proper lineage commitment of progenitors and assisting in rapid red blood cells replenishment following stress.",,"['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cell fate', 'differentiation', 'erythropoiesis', 'hematopoiesis', 'p15Ink4b', 'stem cell']",,PMC3556574,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cooperative model between two classes of mutations has been suggested by murine experiments and partly supported by epidemiological findings. In the last 5 years, comprehensive genomic analysis proceeded to find new gene mutations, which are found in the epigenome-associated enzymes and the molecules never noticed so far. These new mutations apparently increase the complexity and heterogeneity of AML. Although a long list of gene mutations might have been compiled, the entire picture of molecular pathogenesis in AML remains to be elucidated because gene rearrangement, gene copy number, DNA methylation and expression profiles are not fully studied in conjunction with gene mutations. Comprehensive genome research will deepen the understanding of AML to promote the development of new classification and treatment.

METHODS: A fragment of DT388sBAFF fusion gene was separated from plasmid pUC57-DT388sBAFF digested with Nde I and Xho I, and inserted into the expression vector pcold II digested with the same enzymes. Recombinants were screened by the colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction map. The recombinant expression vector was transformed into BL21 and its expression was induced by isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot, and then purified by Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography. The expression level of B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) on BALL-1 cells was assessed by real-time PCR. The receptor binding capacity of recombinant protein was determined by cell fluorescent assay. The specific cytotoxicity of recombinant protein on BALL-1 cells was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.

However, recent studies have implicated the Notch pathway as a tumor suppressor in myeloproliferative neoplasms and several solid tumors. Here we report a novel tumor suppressor role for Notch signaling in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and demonstrate that Notch pathway activation could represent a therapeutic strategy in this disease. We show that Notch signaling is silenced in human AML samples, as well as in AML-initiating cells in an animal model of the disease. In vivo activation of Notch signaling using genetic Notch gain of function models or in vitro using synthetic Notch ligand induces rapid cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of AML-initiating cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that Notch inactivation cooperates in vivo with loss of the myeloid tumor suppressor Tet2 to induce AML-like disease.

Here, we report that human AML samples have robust expression of Notch receptors; however, Notch receptor activation and expression of downstream Notch targets are remarkably low, suggesting that Notch is present but not constitutively activated in human AML. The functional role of these Notch receptors in AML is not known. Induced activation through any of the Notch receptors (Notch1-4), or through the Notch target Hairy/Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1), consistently leads to AML growth arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis, which are associated with B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) loss and enhanced p53/p21 expression. These effects were dependent on the HES1 repressor domain and were rescued through reexpression of BCL2. Importantly, activated Notch1, Notch2, and HES1 all led to inhibited AML growth in vivo, and Notch inhibition via dnMAML enhanced proliferation in vivo, thus revealing the physiological inhibition of AML growth in vivo in response to Notch signaling. As a novel therapeutic approach, we used a Notch agonist peptide that led to significant apoptosis in AML patient samples. In conclusion, we report consistent Notch-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in human AML, and propose the development of Notch agonists as a potential therapeutic approach in AML.",,"['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3570106,,,,['Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2013 Apr;12(4):263.

To unravel the underlying pathomechanisms and the clinical course we assessed molecular alterations and clinical characteristics in a large cohort of ETP-ALL (n = 68) in comparison to non-ETP T-ALL adult patients. Interestingly, we found a high rate of FLT3-mutations in ETP-ALL samples (n = 24, 35%). Furthermore, FLT3 mutated ETP-ALL was characterized by a specific immunophenotype (CD2+/CD5-/CD13+/CD33-), a distinct gene expression pattern (aberrant expression of IGFBP7, WT1, GATA3) and mutational status (absence of NOTCH1 mutations and a low frequency, 21%, of clonal TCR rearrangements). The observed low GATA3 expression and high WT1 expression in combination with lack of NOTCH1 mutations and a low rate of TCR rearrangements point to a leukemic transformation at the pluripotent prothymocyte stage in FLT3 mutated ETP-ALL. The clinical outcome in ETP-ALL patients was poor, but encouraging in those patients with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (3-year OS: 74%). To further explore the efficacy of targeted therapies, we demonstrate that T-ALL cell lines transfected with FLT3 expression constructs were particularly sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In conclusion, FLT3 mutated ETP-ALL defines a molecular distinct stem cell like leukemic subtype.

In this light, new therapies that specifically target signaling molecules downstream of the BCR continue to be developed. While first studies on the selective small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis. To investigate the requirement of Btk signaling for CLL development, we modulated Btk expression in the IgH.ETmu CLL mouse model, which is based on sporadic expression of the simian oncovirus SV40 T-antigen in mature B cells. To this end, we crossed IgH.ETmu mice on a Btk-deficient background or introduced a human Btk transgene (CD19-hBtk). Here we show that Btk deficiency fully abrogates CLL formation in IgH.ETmu mice, and that leukemias formed in Btk haplo-insufficient mice selectively expressed the wild-type Btk allele on their active X chromosome. Conversely, Btk overexpression accelerated CLL onset, increased mortality, and was associated with selection of non-stereotypical BCRs into CLL clones. Taken together, these data show that Btk expression represents an absolute prerequisite for CLL development and that Btk mediated signaling enhances leukemogenesis in mice. We therefore conclude that in CLL Btk expression levels set the threshold for malignant transformation.",,"['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell receptor signaling', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', ""bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)""]",['10-0562/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],PMC3555194,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients achieving complete remission (CR) on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 were eligible for random assignment to 1) dexamethasone or prednisone, administered as 5-day pulses, every 3 weeks, and 2) weekly EC-Asnase, administered as a 25,000 IU/m(2) fixed dose (FD) or individualized dose (ID) starting at 12,500-IU/m(2), adjusted every 3 weeks based on nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) determinations. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2004, 492 evaluable patients (ages 1 to 18 years) enrolled; 473 patients (96%) achieved CR. Four hundred eight patients (86%) participated in the corticosteroid randomization and 384 patients (81%) in the EC-Asnase randomization. With 4.9 years of median follow-up, dexamethasone was associated with superior 5-year event-free survival (EFS; 90% v 81% for prednisone; P = .01) but higher rates of infection (P = .03) and, in older children, higher cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis (P = .02) and fracture (P = .06). ID EC-Asnase had superior 5-year EFS (90% v 82% for FD; P = .04), but did not reduce the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity. Multivariable analysis identified both dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase as independent predictors of favorable EFS. CONCLUSION: There was no overall difference in skeletal toxicity by corticosteroid type; dexamethasone was associated with more infections and, in older children, increased incidence of osteonecrosis and fracture. There was no difference in asparaginase-related toxicity by EC-Asnase dosing method. Dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase were each associated with superior EFS.

As a result of this signaling event, they affect many cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Increases in the expressions of STAT5A and STAT5B play a remarkable role in the development of leukemia in which leukemic cells gain uncontrolled proliferation and angiogenesis ability. At the same time, these cells acquire ability to escape from apoptosis and host immune system. In this study, we aimed to suppress STAT-5A and -5B genes in K562 CML cells by siRNA transfection and antisense oligonucleotides (ODN) targeting and then to evaluate apoptosis rate. Finally, we compared the transfection efficiencies of these approaches. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot results indicated that STAT expressions were downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels following siRNA transfection. However, electroporation mediated ODN transfection could only provide limited suppression rates at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, it was displayed that apoptosis were significantly induced in siRNA treated leukemic cells as compared to ODN treated cells. As a conclusion, siRNA applications were found to be more effective in terms of gene silencing when compared to ODN treatment based on the higher apoptosis and mRNA suppression rates. siRNA application could be a new and alternative curative method as a supporting therapy in CML patients.",,"['Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'K562', 'STAT5', 'antisense oligonucleotides', 'apoptosis', 'siRNA knockdown']",,PMC3555192,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TAK-901 is an investigational, multitargeted Aurora B kinase inhibitor derived from a novel azacarboline kinase hinge-binder chemotype. TAK-901 exhibited time-dependent, tight-binding inhibition of Aurora B, but not Aurora A. Consistent with Aurora B inhibition, TAK-901 suppressed cellular histone H3 phosphorylation and induced polyploidy. In various human cancer cell lines, TAK-901 inhibited cell proliferation with effective concentration values from 40 to 500 nmol/L. Examination of a broad panel of kinases in biochemical assays revealed inhibition of multiple kinases. However, TAK-901 potently inhibited only a few kinases other than Aurora B in intact cells, including FLT3 and FGFR2. In rodent xenografts, TAK-901 exhibited potent activity against multiple human solid tumor types, and complete regression was observed in the ovarian cancer A2780 model. TAK-901 also displayed potent activity against several leukemia models. In vivo biomarker studies showed that TAK-901 induced pharmacodynamic responses consistent with Aurora B inhibition and correlating with retention of TAK-901 in tumor tissue. These preclinical data highlight the therapeutic potential of TAK-901, which has entered phase I clinical trials in patients within a diverse range of cancers.",,"['Discovery Biology, Takeda San Diego, Inc. 10410 Science Center Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this phase II study (no. NCT00443339), lower-risk MDS patients with anemia and endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) level <500 IU/L received DAR 500 mug once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, with G-CSF added at week 12 in non-responders. Physical performance was assessed with the 6-min walking test and, for fit patients, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). QoL was evaluated using SF-36 and FACT-An tests. In 99 patients, erythroid response rate according to IWG 2006 criteria was 48 and 56 % at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Addition of G-CSF rescued 22 % of non-responders. In 48 % of the responders, interval between darbepoetin injections could be increased for maintenance treatment. Serum EPO level was the only independent predictive factor of response at 12 weeks, and its most discriminant cutoff value was 100 IU/L. QoL and VO2max showed improvement over time in responders, compared with non-responders. With a median follow-up of 52 months, median response duration was not reached, and 3-year cumulative incidence of acute myeloid leukemia and overall survival (OS) was 14.5 and 70 %, respectively. Baseline transfusion dependence, International Prognostic Score System (IPSS), and Revised IPSS accurately predicted OS from treatment onset. Tolerance of darbepoetin was good. In conclusion, this regimen of darbepoetin every 2 weeks yielded high response rates and prolonged response duration. Objective improvement in exercise testing and in patient-reported QoL confirms the clinical relevance of anemia correction with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.",,"[""GFM Service d'Hematogie Clinique, Hopital Avicenne, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Universite Paris 13, 125 rue de Stalingrad, Bobigny, France.""]",,,,"['Ann Hematol. 2013 May;92(5):633.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) can progress quickly and without treatment can become fatal in a short period of time. However, over the last 30 years fine-tuning of therapeutics have increased the rates of remission and cure. Cytogenetics and mutational gene profiling, combined with the option of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offered in selected patients have further optimized AML treatment on a risk stratification basis in younger adults. However there is still an unmet medical need for effective therapies in AML since disease relapses in almost half of adult patients becoming refractory to salvage therapy. Improvements in the understanding of molecular biology of cancer and identification of recurrent mutations in AML provide opportunities to develop targeted therapies and improve the clinical outcome. In the spectrum of identified gene mutations, primarily targetable lesions are gain of function mutations of tyrosine kinases FLT3, JAK2 and cKIT for which specific, dual and multi-targeted small molecule inhibitors have been developed. A number of targeted compounds such as sorafenib, quizartinib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin, pacritinib, PLX3397 and CCT137690 are in clinical development. For loss-of-function gene mutations, which are mostly biomarkers of favorable prognosis, combined therapeutic approaches can maximize the therapeutic efficacy of conventional therapy. Apart from mutated gene products, proteins aberrantly overexpressed in AML appear to be clinically significant therapeutic targets. Such a molecule for which targeted inhibitors are currently in clinical development is PLK1. We review characteristic gene mutations, discuss their biological functions and clinical significance and present small molecule compounds in clinical development, which are expected to have a role in treating AML subtypes with characteristic molecular alterations.",,"['Department of Hematology, University of Ioannina Ioannina, Greece.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CEBPA', 'FLT3', 'JAK2', 'NPM1', 'mutation', 'targeted therapy']",,PMC3555190,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TanIIA has been hypothesized to inhibit numerous human cancer cells by various molecular mechanisms. However, the efficacy and molecular mechanism of TanIIA action in pancreatic cancer has not been well studied. In the present study, the cytotoxicity of TanIIA in human pancreatic cancer BxPC3 cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell cycle analysis of BxPC3 cells treated with TanIIA was performed by flow cytometry (FACS). Protein expression levels of TCTP, Mcl1, BclxL, Bax and Caspase3 in BxPC3 cells were measured by western blot analysis. The results revealed that TanIIA inhibited BxPC3 cells in a time and dosedependent manner. FACS analysis demonstrated that TanIIA increases the rate of subG1 phase. BxPC3 cells treated with TanIIA were identified to upregulate protein expression of Bax and Caspase3 and downregulate expression of TCTP, Mcl1 and BclxL. These results indicate that TanIIA may inhibit BxPC3 human pancreatic cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis by decreasing protein expression of TCTP, Mcl1 and BclxL and increasing Bax expression in vitro.

The morphology of CNF was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and the surface charge by Zeta potential. Cell viability was analyzed by flow cytometry assay and gene expression of biomarkers focused on cell stress response such as Heat shock protein 70.1 (HSP70.1) and Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and apoptosis as B-cell leukemia (BCL-2) and BCL-2 associated X protein (BAX) by RT-PCR assay. Low concentrations of CNF (0.02-100 mug ml(-1)) did not cause cell death; however, at concentrations above 200 mug ml(-1), the nanofibers significantly decreased cell viability (86.41 +/- 5.37%).

Epub 2013 Jan 28.,"KMT2B (MLL2/WBP7) is a member of the MLL subfamily of H3K4-specific histone lysine methyltransferases (KMT2) and is vital for normal embryonic development in the mouse. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying KMT2B function, we focused on MagohB, which is controlled by a CpG island promoter. We show that in cells lacking Mll2-the gene encoding KMT2B-the MagohB promoter resides in inaccessible chromatin and is methylated. To dissect the molecular events leading to the establishment of silencing, we performed kinetic studies in Mll2-conditional-knockout embryonic stem cells. KMT2B depletion was followed by the loss of the active chromatin marks and progressive loss of RNA polymerase II binding with a concomitant downregulation of MagohB expression. Once the active chromatin marks were lost, the MagohB promoter was rapidly methylated. We demonstrate that in the presence of KMT2B, neither transcription elongation nor RNA polymerase II binding is required to maintain H3K4 trimethylation at the MagohB promoter and protect it from DNA methylation. Reexpression of KMT2B was sufficient to reinstate an active MagohB promoter. Our study provides a paradigm for the idea that KMT2 proteins are crucial components for establishing and maintaining the transcriptionally active and unmethylated state of CpG island promoters.",,"['School of Cancer Sciences, Institute of Biomedical Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,['100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],PMC3624271,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 28.,"BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing is routinely performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for all new cases of invasive breast carcinoma. IHC is easier to perform, but analysis can be subjective and variable. FISH offers better diagnostic accuracy and added confidence, particularly when it is used to supplement weak IHC signals, but it is more labor intensive and costly than IHC. We examined the performance of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as a more precise and less subjective alternative for quantifying HER2 DNA amplification. METHODS: Thirty-nine cases of invasive breast carcinoma containing >/=30% tumor were classified as positive or negative for HER2 by IHC, FISH, or both. DNA templates for these cases were prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues to determine the HER2 copy number by ddPCR. ddPCR involved emulsifying hydrolysis probe-based PCR reaction mixtures containing the ERBB2 [v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian); also known as HER2] gene and chromosome 17 centromere assays into nanoliter-sized droplets for thermal cycling and analysis. RESULTS: ddPCR distinguished, through differences in the level of HER2 amplification, the 10 HER2-positive samples from the 29 HER2-negative samples with 100% concordance to HER2 status obtained by FISH and IHC analysis. ddPCR results agreed with the FISH results for the 6 cases that were equivocal by IHC analyses, confirming 2 of these samples as positive for HER2 and the other 4 as negative.

Epub 2013 Jan 25.,"The success of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) attracts a great deal of attention to researchers to explore its activity of anti-leukemia. However, ATO has unavailable effect on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), especially multidrug resistant (MDR)-CML, unless using high concentration. Realgar (As(4)S(4)) has been employed in Chinese traditional medicine for 1500 years. Research evidences confirmed realgar has similar effect on treating with APL as ATO, but the problem of large dose and long period in the CML/MDR-CML treatment still exist. By using a microbial leaching process with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, we obtained realgar transforming solution (RTS) which showed significantly higher extent in inhibiting CML cell line K562 and MDR-CML cell line K562/ADM, and then trigger apoptosis. Both K562 and K562/ADM showed arsenic-dose-dependent effect on RTS. Interestingly, the overexpression of MDR1 mRNA and P-glucoprotein (P-gp) in K562/ADM cells were down-regulated by RTS, where there are no obvious effects on ATO and realgar and arsenic can be subsequently accumulated in K562/ADM cells efficiently. The intracellular accumulation of arsenic in K562/ADM cells treated with RTS for 4 h was 2-fold and 16-folds higher than those treated with realgar or ATO. Meanwhile, Western blot analysis of AQP9, the main transporter of arsenic, was increased by RTS treatment particularly in K562/ADM. Thus, these results suggested that the effect from a certain arsenical or a variety of arsenicals in RTS might be a promising candidate both for treating CML/MDR-CML alone and as combinations with currently used anti-CML/MDR-CML drug, although arsenical forms in RTS are undefined.",,"['Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Science, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 28.,"PURPOSE: Relapse of disease and subsequent resistance to established therapies remains a major challenge in the treatment of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). New therapeutic options, such as proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) with a toxicity profile differing from that of conventional cytotoxic agents, are needed for these extensively pretreated patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of combined HDACi/proteasome inhibitor treatments were analyzed using BCP-ALL monocultures, cocultures with primary mesenchymal stroma cells from patients with ALL, and xenograft mouse models. The underlying molecular mechanisms associated with combined treatment were determined by gene expression profiling and protein validation. RESULTS: We identified the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as a promising combination partner for HDACi due to the substantial synergistic antileukemic activity in BCP-ALL cells after concomitant application. This effect was maintained or even increased in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents. The synergistic effect of combined HDACi/BTZ treatment was associated with the regulation of genes involved in cell cycle, JUN/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, p53, ubiquitin/proteasome, and NF-kappaB pathways. We observed an activation of NF-kappaB after bortezomib treatment and the induction of apoptosis-related NF-kappaB target genes such as TNFalphaRs after concomitant treatment, indicating a possible involvement of NF-kappaB as proapoptotic mediator. In this context, significantly lower NF-kappaB subunits gene expression was detected in leukemia cells from patients who developed a relapse during frontline chemotherapy, compared with those who relapsed after cessation of frontline therapy. CONCLUSION: These results provide a rationale for the integration of HDACi/BTZ combinations into current childhood BCP-ALL treatment protocols.",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk association and the clinical outcome of such pulmonary infiltrates are poorly characterized in the literature. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 363 cases of acute myeloid leukemia patients who received induction therapy as inpatients over a period of 11 years at William Beaumont Health System. Of these 363 patients, 120 developed pulmonary infiltrates during induction therapy, those patients were divided into 2 groups based on distribution of the infiltrate presenting as localized or diffuse in nature. Data on patients characteristics, leukemia subtype, cytogenetic risk, microorganism type, white blood cell count at diagnosis, neutrophil count at the time the infiltrate was reported, response to antibiotic and/or antifungal therapy, using respiratory support, and mortality rate were retrieved through chart review. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during their induction therapy. Sixty-three patients (52.5%) had a localized infiltrates and 57 patients (47.5%) had diffuse infiltrates. Of the 120 patients with pulmonary infiltrates, 48 (40%) had at least 1 pathogenic microorganism identified, and 58 (48.7%) required intubation and ventilatory support. Patients with localized pulmonary infiltrates were more likely to have positive pathogenic microorganisms (68.3% vs. 8.8%, P<0.001), to be neutropenic (96.8% vs. 21%, P<0.001), and tended to have potentially reversible infiltrates after treatment (87.3% vs. 21%, P<0.001). Whereas patients with diffuse infiltrates were more like to require intubation (78.9% vs. 21%, P<0.001), to have leukocytosis (white blood cell >100 billions/L) at diagnosis (54.4% vs. 0%, P<0.001), and had a higher mortality rate (70.2% vs. 9.5%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The radiologic patterns of pulmonary infiltrates showed specific etiological and prognostic associations.

Epub 2013 Jan 26.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs, formerly called chronic myeloproliferative disorders) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by the expansion of one or more of the myeloid lineages, including polymorphonuclear, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mastocytic. The major complications of MPN are transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (occurring particularly in chronic myelogenous leukemia) and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events (most commonly observed in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia). Renal involvement by MPN is infrequent. MPN-related glomerulopathy enlarges the spectrum of glomerular diseases associated with haematological neoplasms. MPN-related glomerulopathy is an under recognized late renal complication of MPN with poor prognosis. It is characterized clinically by heavy proteinuria and renal insufficiency. The histologic features of MPN-related glomerulopathy include variable degree of mesangial sclerosis and hypercellularity, segmental sclerosis, features of chronic thrombotic microangiopathy, and intracapillary hematopoietic cell infiltration. PDGF and TGFbeta likely have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MPN-related glomerulopathy. Furthermore, aggregation of circulating hematopoietic cells within glomerular capillaries could potentially result in endothelial injury and morphologic changes resembling chronic thrombotic microangiopathy.

However, major inducers of angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGF-A) have side effects that limit their therapeutic utility in vivo, especially at high concentrations. Angiopoietin-1 has been considered to be a blood vessel stabilization factor that can inhibit the intrinsic property of VEGF to promote vessel leakiness. In this study, we have designed and tested the angiogenic properties of chimeric molecules consisting of receptor-binding parts of VEGF and angiopoietin-1. We aimed at combining the activities of both factors into 1 molecule for easy delivery and expression in target tissues. METHODS AND RESULTS: The VEGF-angiopoietin-1 (VA1) chimeric protein bound to both VEGF receptor-2 and Tie2 and induced the activation of both receptors. Detailed analysis of VA1 versus VEGF revealed differences in the kinetics of VEGF receptor-2 activation and endocytosis, downstream kinase activation, and VE-cadherin internalization. The delivery of a VA1 transgene into mouse skeletal muscle led to increased blood flow and enhanced angiogenesis. VA1 was also very efficient in rescuing ischemic limb perfusion. However, VA1 induced less plasma protein leakage and myeloid inflammatory cell recruitment than VEGF. Furthermore, angioma-like structures associated with VEGF expression were not observed with VA1. CONCLUSIONS: The VEGF-angiopoietin-1 chimera is a potent angiogenic factor that triggers a novel mode of VEGF receptor-2 activation, promoting less vessel leakiness, less tissue inflammation, and better perfusion in ischemic muscle than VEGF. These properties of VA1 make it an attractive therapeutic tool.",,"['Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, PO Box 63 (Haartmaninkatu 8), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, 00014 Finland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 12.,"OBJECTIVES: Serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) is a major acute-phase protein that is increasingly used as a reliable predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study we aim to screen the SAAI promoter and exons for genetic variants and to determine their association with CAD. In addition, we also carried out functional study on a variant of p.Gly90Asp encoded by the SAA1 gene. METHODS: Variant screening of SAA1 was performed using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Genetic association of p.Gly90Asp with CAD was determined in 800 CAD patients and 773 Chinese control subjects. Functional study of p.Gly90Asp was carried out using THP-1-derived macrophages and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. RESULTS: A total of 6 SNPs were identified, of which 2 were found to be novel (c.-913G > A and c.92-5T > G). The rare allele of p.Gly90Asp has a lower frequency of 0.013 in the CAD patients although this is not statistically significant. Functional studies of p.Gly90Asp revealed that the variant has decreased upregulation of key cytokines such as IL-8, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha as well as SERPINB2. CONCLUSIONS: We found the variant p.Gly90Asp SAA1 protein eliciting significantly reduced inflammatory responses in macrophages through a reduction in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Despite strong functional effects, the minor allele frequency is too low in the population to attain statistical significance difference between cases and controls.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been described to play a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of leukemia cells, this enzyme seems to play an important role in chemoresistance in different cancer types. Previously, we demonstrated that diosgenin, a plant steroid, induced apoptosis in HEL cells with concomitant COX-2 overexpression. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of cyclopamine and jervine, two steroidal alkaloids with similar structures, on HEL and TF1a human erythroleukemia cell lines and, for the first time, their effect on COX-2 expression. Cyclopamine, but not jervine, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cells. Both compounds induced COX-2 overexpression which was responsible for apoptosis resistance. In jervine-treated cells, COX-2 overexpression was NF-kappaB dependent. Inhibition of NF-kappaB reduced COX-2 overexpression and induced apoptosis. In addition, cyclopamine induced apoptosis and COX-2 overexpression via PKC activation. Inhibition of the PKC pathway reduced both apoptosis and COX-2 overexpression in both cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the p38/COX-2 pathway was involved in resistance to cyclopamine-induced apoptosis since p38 inhibition reduced COX-2 overexpression and increased apoptosis in both cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Jan 26.,"BACKGROUND: Several evidences support the existence of cytokine deregulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients that may be associated with pathogenesis, disease progression and patient survival. METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in AML patients and age-matched healthy donors. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, IL-12p70, IL-8, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5 were analyzed using fluorescent bead-based technology and TGF-beta by ELISA technique. Because age-associated differences in cytokine profiles have been described, patients and healthy individuals were divided into two age groups: up to 65 years and over 65 years. RESULTS: Our results showed that plasma TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in AML patients from both groups of age. IL-8 was increased in AML patients less than 65 years while the plasma concentrations of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-12p70 were significantly higher only in elderly AML patients compared with aged-matched healthy controls. Moreover, plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were associated with patient survival and event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: An aberrant production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is observed in AML patients. Low levels of IL-6 and high levels of IL-10 represent favorable prognostic factors for survival in AML patients. These results support the idea that cytokine deregulation may be useful as a marker for predicting clinical evolution in AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Jan 26.,"The isolated deletion of chromosome 20q [del(20q)] has been observed in both de novo and therapy-related cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The clinicopathologic features of de novo MDS with isolated del(20q) are well characterized. However, relatively little is known about therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) with isolated del(20q). In this study, we identified five cases of t-MN and 26 cases of de novo MDS with isolated del(20q) over a 10-year period. All cases had a long latency interval from the treatment of the primary malignancy to the onset of t-MN, and all were associated with frequent bone marrow dysplasia. The del(20q) was the sole abnormality detected at the time of diagnosis of t-MN in three cases, six years prior to diagnosis in one case, and at the time of relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in one case.

Epub 2013 Jan 29.,"INTRODUCTION: Lenalidomide , a thalidomide analog, is representative of a new class of antineoplastic drugs which has been especially effective in certain hematologic malignancies such as myeloma and myelodysplasia. Lenalidomide has anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties, and targets tumor cells by direct cytotoxicity and, indirectly by interfering with several components of the tumor microenvironment [1]. Lenalidomide retains antitumor activity equal to or greater than the parent compound, thalidomide, but with less toxicity [2]. AREAS COVERED: This paper summarizes what is known about the mechanisms of action of lenalidomide, and recent clinical results in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A literature review was accomplished by searching the PubMed database for papers in English. Publications from 2000 through November 2012 were analyzed. Search terms used were lenalidomide, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. A manual search of conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society of Hematology, America Association of Cancer Research, and the European Hematology Association was also conducted. Relevant references in chosen papers were also considered. EXPERT OPINION: The data suggest that lenalidomide will play a major role in the management of certain lymphoid neoplasms such as B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and, perhaps, T-cell lymphoma.",,"['Continuum Cancer Centers of New York, St. Lukes-Roosevelt and Beth Israel Medical Center, Leukemia Program, 1000 10th Ave, Ste. 11C-02, New York, NY 10019, USA. pwiernik@aol.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 29.,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90; HSP90AA1) is a molecular chaperone involved in signalling pathways for cell proliferation, survival, and cellular adaptation. Inhibitors of HSP90 are being examined as anti-cancer agents, but the critical molecular mechanism(s) of their activity remains unresolved. HSP90 inhibition potentially facilitates the simultaneous targeting of multiple molecules within tumour cells and represents an attractive therapeutic proposition. Here, we investigated HSP90 as a molecular target for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using the novel HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922-AG. NVP-AUY922-AG induced dose-dependent killing in myeloid cell lines and primary AML blasts. In primary blasts, cell death in response to NVP-AUY922-AG was seen at concentrations almost 2 logs lower than cytarabine (Ara-C) (50% lethal dose = 0.12 mu mol/l +/- 0.28). NVP-AUY922-AG was significantly less toxic to normal bone marrow (P = 0.02). In vitro response to NVP-AUY922-AG did not correlate with response to Ara-C (r(2) = 0.0006). NVP-AUY922-AG was highly synergistic with Ara-C in cell lines and in 20/25 of the primary samples tested. NVP-AUY922-AG induced increases in HSP70 expression and depletion of total AKT, IKKalpha and IKKbeta in cell lines and primary blasts. This study shows that the novel HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922-AG has significant single agent activity in AML cells and is synergistic with Ara-C.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Cardiff Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK. walsbyej@cf.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumours release large quantities of TEXs, and the protein content of exosome or MV (microvesicle) fractions isolated from patients' sera is high. TEXs down-regulate functions of immune cells, thus promoting tumour progression. We isolated TEXs from tumour cell supernatants and sera of patients with solid tumours or AML (acute myelogenous leukaemia). The molecular profile of TEXs was distinct from that of circulating exosomes derived from normal cells. TEXs were co-incubated with activated T-cells, conventional CD4(+) CD25(neg) T-cells or CD56(+) CD16(+) NK (natural killer) cells respectively. TEXs down-regulated CD3zeta and JAK3 (Janus kinase 3) expression in primary activated T-cells and mediated Fas/FasL (Fas ligand)-driven apoptosis of CD8(+) T-cells. TEXs promoted CD4(+) CD25(neg) T-cell proliferation and their conversion into CD4(+) CD25(hi)FOXP3+ (FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) Treg cells (regulatory T-cells), which also expressed IL-10 (interleukin 10), TGFbeta1 (transforming growth factor beta1), CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), GrB (granzyme B)/perforin and effectively mediated suppression. Neutralizing antibodies specific for TGFbeta1 and/or IL-10 inhibited the ability of TEXs to expand Treg cells. TEXs obtained at diagnosis from AML patients' sera were positive for blast-associated markers CD33, CD34, CD117 and TGFbeta1, and they decreased cytotoxic activity of NK cells isolated from NC (normal control) donors, induced Smad phosphorylation and down-regulated NKG2D receptor expression. Correlations between the TEX molecular profile or TEX protein levels and clinical data in cancer patients suggest that TEX-mediated effects on immune cells are prognostically important. In contrast with exosomes released by normal cells, TEXs have immunosuppressive properties and are involved in regulating peripheral tolerance in patients with cancer.",,"['Departments of Pathology, Immunology and Otolaryngology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. whitesidetl@upmc.edu']",,,,,,,"['P01 CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3721347,['NIHMS489295'],,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL dependent mechanisms are most frequently associated with point mutations in tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of BCR-ABL1 and also with BCR-ABL gene amplification. Many different types and frequencies of mutations have been reported in different studies, probably due to the different composition of study cohorts. Since no reports are available from Malaysia, this study was undertaken to investigate the frequency and pattern of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations using dHPLC followed by sequencing, and also status of BCR-ABL gene amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on 40 IM resistant Malaysian CML patients. Mutations were detected in 13 patients (32.5%). Five different types of mutations (T315I, E255K, Y253H, M351T, V289F) were identified in these patients. In the remaining 27 IM resistant CML patients, we investigated the contribution made by BCR-ABL gene amplification, but none of these patients showed amplification. It is presumed that the mechanisms of resistance in these 27 patients might be due to BCR-ABL independent pathways.

We investigated the incidence of the FLT3/ITD mutation and FLT3/D835 (I836) point mutation in 25 APL patients. Incidence ratios of FLT3/ITD, D835 (I836), and both FLT3/ITD and D835 (I836) were 36%, 36% and 8%, respectively. FLT3/ITD(+) cases showed a predominance of the bcr3 isoform (P=0.008) and M3v morphology (P<0.001). We found that all FLT3/ITD(+) cases expressed CD2 (9 of 9) more frequently than that of FLT3/ITD(-) (1 of 16) (P<0.001), while only one of the CD2(+) cases (1 of 10, 10%) did not harbor FLT3/ITD, and all CD2(+)CD34(+) cases (5 of 5, 100%) harbored FLT3/ITD. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that FLT3 mRNA was more abundantly expressed in FLT3/ITD(+) than that in FLT3/ITD(-) (P=0.025), while there was no difference between D835(I836) (+) and D835(I836)(-) with regards to aberrant surface-antigen expression, expression levels of FLT3 mRNA, M3v morphology, and the bcr3 isoform of PML-RARalpha mRNA. This study demonstrates that the presence of FLT3/ITD, but not D835 (I836), is closely related to aberrant CD2 expression and high expression levels of FLT3 mRNA. Our findings also suggest that FLT3/ITD as a secondary genetic event may block differentiation at the immature stage of APL.",,"['Faculty of Pharmacological Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Hyogo; Japan;']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD2', 'FLT3/ D835', 'FLT3/ITD', 'immature phenotype.']",,PMC3555210,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 25.,"The promyelocytic zinc finger transcription factor (PLZF) is required for the development of activated phenotypes in NKT and other innate T lymphocytes. Although strong TCR stimulation has been implicated in the induction of PLZF, the factors regulating PLZF expression are incompletely understood. We show in this study that costimulation of preselection double-positive thymocytes through the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family receptor Ly108 markedly enhanced PLZF expression compared with that induced by TCR stimulation alone. Costimulation with Ly108 increased expression of early growth response protein (Egr)-2 and binding of Egr-2 to the promoter of Zbtb16, which encodes PLZF, and resulted in PLZF levels similar to those seen in NKT cells. In contrast, costimulation with anti-CD28 failed to enhance Egr-2 binding and Zbtb16 expression. Moreover, mice lacking Ly108 showed decreased numbers of PLZF-expressing CD4(+) T cells. Together, these results support a potential role for Ly108 in the induction of PLZF.",,"['National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 AI081314/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI081314/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HG000123-15/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 HG999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'AI045196/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HG000123-14/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HG000123-13/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3578000,['NIHMS432533'],,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective study using matched case-control areas. SETTING: Five circular regions of radius 10 km near industrial incinerators in England (case regions) and five matched control regions, 1998-2008. PARTICIPANTS: All cases of diseases of interest within the circular areas. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Counts of childhood cancer incidence (<15 years); childhood leukaemia incidence (<15 years); leukaemia incidence; liver cancer incidence; lung cancer incidence; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence; all-cause mortality; infant mortality (<1 year) and liver cancer mortality. RESULTS: The estimated relative risks for case circles versus control circles for the nine outcomes considered range from 0.94 to 1.14, and show neither elevated risk in case circles compared to control areas nor elevated risk with proximity to incinerators within case circles. CONCLUSIONS: This study applies statistical methods for analysing spatially referenced health outcome data in regions with a hypothesised exposure relative to matched regions with no such exposure.

We used human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells as a model system to investigate the effect of nuclear shape in whole cell deformability. We probed neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells lacking expression of lamin B receptor, which fail to develop lobulated nuclei during granulopoiesis and present an in vitro model for Pelger-Huet anomaly; despite the circular morphology of their nuclei, the cells passed through micron-scale constrictions on similar timescales as scrambled controls. We then investigated the unique nuclear envelope composition of neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells, which may also impact their deformability; although lamin A is typically down-regulated during granulopoiesis, we genetically modified HL-60 cells to generate a subpopulation of cells with well defined levels of ectopic lamin A. The lamin A-overexpressing neutrophil-type cells showed similar functional characteristics as the mock controls, but they had an impaired ability to pass through micron-scale constrictions. Our results suggest that levels of lamin A have a marked effect on the ability of neutrophils to passage through micron-scale constrictions, whereas the unusual multilobed shape of the neutrophil nucleus is less essential.",,"[""Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139; Department of Physics and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.

Individualized therapy regimens promise the least toxic therapy regimen with the best hematologic outcome. Our aim was to investigate whether increased individual glucocorticoid sensitivity due to the N363S polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor increased susceptibility to steroid-related toxicities during ALL therapy. A total of 346 pediatric ALL patients were involved in the present study. N363S carrier status was investigated by allele-specific PCR. Clinical and laboratory signs of glucocorticoid-related toxicities, Day 8 prednisone response, and 5-year event-free survival were analyzed and compared retrospectively. Thirty-two of the 346 patients were heterozygous carriers (9.2 %). Hepatotoxicity (31.3 vs. 11.2 %, p = 0.004, carriers and non-carriers, respectively) and glucose metabolism abnormalities (18.8 vs. 3.8 %, p = 0.001, carriers and non-carriers, respectively) were significantly more frequent among carriers. There was no difference in the incidence of hypertension and encephalopathy/psychosis among carriers and non-carriers. Carriers were also more prone to have a combination of toxicities. All 363S carriers were good prednisone responders (100 %) and had significantly better 5-year event-free survival rates (93.1 vs. 71.86 %, p = 0.012), whereas among non-carriers there were more poor prednisone responders (8.28 %) and worse 5-year event-free survival rates. Patients with the N363S polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor are more prone to steroid-related toxicity during ALL therapy and should be monitored more closely. Patients with N363S polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor may be appropriate candidates for inclusion in the design of individualized therapies.",,"['2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine, Tuzolto u.7-9, Budapest 1094, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated gene mutation profiles and prognostic implications in a series of Korean T-ALL patients. The study patients were 29 Korean patients with T-ALL; 13 adults (45 %) and 16 children (55 %; male-to-female ratio, 25:4). Clinical, hematologic, and cytogenetic findings were reviewed. We performed mutation analyses for NOTCH1, FBXW7, PHF6, and IL7R genes and survival analyses according to the mutational status. Gene mutations were identified in 66 % of the patients in our series (19/29). Eighteen patients (62 %) had NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. Sixteen patients (55 %) had NOTCH1 mutations including nine novel mutations, and eight patients (28 %) had known FBXW7 mutations. Eight patients (28 %; six males and two females) had PHF6 mutations including four novel mutations. Three patients (10 %) had IL7R mutations, which were all novel in-frame insertion or deletion-insertions. The gene mutation profile combined with cytogenetics and FISH study for the p16 gene detected genetic aberrations in 90 % of patients (26/29). There was no significant difference in the frequency of gene mutations between the pediatric and adult patients with T-ALL. Survival analyses suggested a favorable prognostic implication of NOTCH1 mutations in adult T-ALL. Gene mutation studies for NOTCH1, FBXW7, PHF6, and IL7R could detect genetic alterations in a majority of Korean T-ALL patients with novel mutations. We observed similar mutation profiles between adult and pediatric T-ALL, and a favorable prognostic implication of NOTCH1 mutations in adult T-ALL.",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 50 Irwon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of P- and HG-alkyl (C4-C18) esters (0.1-100muM) on human leukemia T (Jurkat) cells viability and plasma membrane fluidity were evaluated. After 1h of exposure, cell viability was not affected in the range 0.1-10muM. The decrease of cell viability found at 100muM concentration depended on the length of the alkyl chain and reached a maximum with C6-C12 derivatives. At this concentration, cell hyperpolarization and shrinkage were also observed. Cell plasma membrane fluidity was not affected, regardless the depths of the membrane level evaluated, but mild changes in plasma membrane hydration were found. Esterification did not affect the antioxidant capacity of P and HG (0.1-10muM) against 1mM H2O2. When exposed to 1mM AAPH, P-alkyl esters retained P antioxidant capacity, but HG-derivatives acted as pro-oxidants. Together, present experimental evidences suggest that short term exposures to 0.1-10muM concentrations of P- and HG-alkyl (C4-C18) esters can be considered safe for cultured human cells, and further studies are required to investigate their long term effects, as well their safety for human consumption.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Jan 26.,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes is characterised by pancreatic beta cell death and dysfunction, resulting from unbalanced pro-survival and pro-death signalling. The 14-3-3 proteins are molecular adaptors that integrate numerous signalling pathways, including the v-raf-leukaemia viral oncogene 1 (RAF1)/B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) pathway, which we have previously implicated in insulin-dependent beta cell survival. Nevertheless, the roles of 14-3-3 proteins in beta cell fate and function have not been investigated. METHODS: We examined the abundance, localisation, modulation and roles of 14-3-3 proteins using quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblot or imaging. MIN6 cells or mouse islets cells were manipulated with inhibitors, short interfering RNA (siRNA) or plasmids overexpressing 14-3-3. RESULTS: We first characterised the abundance and subcellular location of all seven 14-3-3 isoforms in mouse and human beta cells. Most isoforms were cytoplasmic, except 14-3-3sigma, which appeared to be nuclear. Analysis of 14-3-3 abundance under stress conditions revealed distinct modulation in mouse islets and MIN6 cells. Generalised 14-3-3 inhibition promoted apoptosis and dysfunction, and siRNA-mediated knockdown revealed isoform-specific roles in caspase-3-dependent beta cell apoptosis, with a clear role for 14-3-3zeta. Overabundance of 14-3-3zeta sequestered BAD-BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) from mitochondria, attenuated Dp5 (also known as Hrk) and Puma (also known as Bbc3) induction, and increased survival in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines or thapsigargin. Anti-apoptotic insulin treatment increased the sequestration of BAD/BAX by 14-3-3zeta. BAD mutants that were unable to bind 14-3-3zeta localised to mitochondria and induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This first study of the 14-3-3 family in beta cells revealed specific regulation, localisation and anti-apoptotic roles among the isoforms. Focus on 14-3-3zeta revealed its importance in preventing BAD-BAX mitochondrial localisation and protecting beta cells from multiple stresses. Thus, some 14-3-3 proteins are pro-survival signalling hubs.",,"['Diabetes Research Group, Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, University of British Columbia, 5358 Life Sciences Building, 2350 Health Sciences Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3.']",,,,,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions between myeloma and BM cells facilitate tumor progression and resistance to therapies. CXCR4 and its ligand Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) have a primary role in this process and are associated with poor prognosis. The Notch pathway is active in myeloma cells, resulting in increased proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and osteolytic activity. We hypothesized that the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis mediates the effects of Notch signals in myeloma cells. Here we show that Notch positively controls CXCR4/SDF-1 expression and functions in myeloma cell lines, and that forced CXCR4 activation partially rescues tumor cells from the outcomes of Notch inhibition. Additionally, we provide evidences that Notch blocking in vivo significantly reduces BM infiltration by human myeloma cells in mouse xenografts. This is the first evidence that a Notch-targeted approach effectively prevents MM cell migration, proliferation and resistance to apoptosis by reducing CXCR4 and SDF-1 levels.",,"['Department of Health Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"Obesity is known to be an important risk factor for many types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, liver and endometrial cancer. Recently, epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity correlates with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer in developed countries. Leptin is predominantly produced by adipocytes and acts as a growth factor and serum leptin levels positively correlate with the amount of body fat. In this study, we investigated the effects of leptin on the growth of ovarian cancer cells and the underlying mechanism(s) of action. Our results showed that leptin stimulated the growth of the OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell line using MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion. Using western blot analysis, we found that leptin enhanced the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1, which are important regulators of cell proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. To investigate the signaling pathways that mediate the effects of leptin, cells were treated with leptin plus specific inhibitors of JAK2, PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 and analysis of the phosphorylation state of proteins was carried out by western blot assays. We showed that the activation of the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were involved in the growth-stimulating effect of leptin on ovarian cancer cell growth and the specific inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 revealed that these two pathways interacted with each other. Our data demonstrate that leptin upregulates the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 to stimulate cell growth by activating the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in ovarian cancer.",,"['Department of Veterinary Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",,,,['Int J Oncol. 2016 Aug;49(2):847.

However, current treatment protocols are still largely ineffective in cases of relapsed leukemia and are associated with a significant rate of chronic health conditions. Thus, there is a continued need for new therapeutic options. Here, we show that mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MerTK) was abnormally expressed in approximately one half of pediatric T-cell leukemia patient samples and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines. Stimulation of MerTK by the ligand Gas6 led to activation of the prosurvival proteins Erk 1/2 and Stat5, and MerTK-dependent activation of the STAT pathway in leukemia represents a novel finding. Furthermore, inhibition of MerTK expression increased the sensitivity of T-ALL cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and decreased the oncogenic potential of the Jurkat T-ALL cell line in a methylcellulose colony-forming assay. Lastly, inhibition of MerTK expression significantly increased median survival in a xenograft mouse model of leukemia (30.5 days vs 60 days, P<0.0001). These results suggest that inhibition of MerTK is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia and may allow for dose reduction of currently used chemotherapeutics resulting in decreased rates of therapy-associated toxicities.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MerTK', 'T-cell leukemia', 'receptor tyrosine kinase', 'xenograft mouse model']","['F32 HL096416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025780/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3556576,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since CLL is characterized by overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, treatments with their antagonists, such as ABT-737, represent a promising new therapeutic strategy. ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic agent which binds Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w with high affinity, while weakly interacts with Mcl-1 and Bfl-1. Previous studies demonstrated that quercetin, a flavonoid naturally present in food and beverages, was able to sensitize B-cells isolated from CLL patients to apoptosis when associated with death ligands or fludarabine, through a mechanism involving Mcl-1 down-regulation. Here, we report that the association between ABT-737 and quercetin synergistically induces apoptosis in B-cells and in five leukemic cell lines (Combination Index <1). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell from healthy donors were not affected by quercetin treatment. The molecular pathways triggered by quercetin have been investigated in HPB-ALL cells, characterized by the highest resistance to both ABT-737 and quercetin when applied as single molecules, but highly sensitivity to the co-treatment. In this cell line, quercetin down-regulated Mcl-1 through the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to Mcl-1 instability. The same mechanism was confirmed in B-cells.

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"The prognosis of patients with refractory/relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (rAML) is poor. Recent studies have shown that more transplant centers are choosing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) for recipients, even with a higher leukemia burden. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the outcome of rAML patients undergoing allo-PBSCT and to determine whether the disease status can predict the post-transplantation survival. The outcome of 58 patients (median age, 34 years; range, 14 to 52) with rAML who underwent allo-PBSCT in our institution from January 2000 until September 2011 was retrospectively studied. Thirty-three patients had complete remission (CR) before PBSCT, whereas 25 patients had no remission. Donors were matched related (31 patients) and unrelated (27 patients). Reduced-intensity conditioning was used for 18 patients with rAML, and myeloablative conditioning was used for others. Sixty-six consecutive non-rAML patients (median age, 33 years; range, 15 to 51) who received an allo-PBSCT at the same period were used as a control. Full donor-type engraftment was achieved in all patients. After a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5-year overall survival of rAML patients was 54.21% +/- 7.06%, which was lower than non-rAML patients (71.82% +/- 6.4%, P = .0386). However, the 5-year event-free survival for rAML and non-rAML patients had no statistical significance (53.54% +/- 6.87% versus 62.07% +/- 6.78%, P = .2626). The 5-year overall survival between rAML patients who had CR and no remission before PBSCT was 56.06% +/- 9.2% and 51.85% +/- 10.83%, respectively (P = .6408). These data demonstrate that allo-PBSCT is a promising and safe choice for the treatment of rAML, and the results were partially due to the rapid tapering of immunosuppressants in the early stage after PBSCT and prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion. Meanwhile, the patients who did not achieve CR before PBSCT could also benefit from allo-PBSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"AIMS: This study aims to identify by a molecular genetic approach potential targets in mast cells at which 1,4-benzodiazepines may cause their inhibitory effect on mast cell activity. MAIN METHODS: Gene expression analyses with microarray gene chip and/or quantitative PCR were performed using 1,4-benzodiazepine-treated human mast cell leukemia HMC-1.2 cells, promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and human mast cells from healthy volunteers and patients with mast cell activation disease (MCAD). Pathway analysis was applied to search for enriched biological functions and canonical pathways within differentially regulated genes. KEY FINDINGS: Both neoplastic and normal human mast cells express several GABA(A) receptor subunits at the mRNA level. In mast cells from MCAD patients expression of some GABA(A) receptor subunits and expression of the translocator protein TSPO are increased compared with those from healthy controls. Expression of the protein tyrosine kinases Lyn, Fgr and Yes1 was increased in HMC-1.2 cells as compared with the ontogenetically related HL60 cells. Differences in gene regulation in HMC-1.2 cells after treatment with the 1,4-benzodiazepines clonazepam, flunitrazepam and 4-chlorodiazepam suggested that signaling and gene expression induced by clonazepam was similar to that of flunitrazepam but different from that of 4-chlorodiazepam. This conclusion is supported by the results of the pathway analysis. SIGNIFICANCE: A novel type of GABA(A) receptors on mast cells appears to be involved in the inhibition of mast cell activity by 1,4-benzodiazepines. These receptors seem to be composed without gamma subunits suggesting unique pharmacological properties. An action at Src-kinases, or at TSPO located in the plasma membrane may also be involved.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we highlight a unique molecular mechanism whereby the RUNX1 gene is directly activated by MLL-AF4 and the RUNX1 protein interacts with the product of the reciprocal AF4-MLL translocation.

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have evidenced an increase in the incidence of childhood leukaemia since the 1970s but the variations since 2000 have received little attention. Seasonal variations in incidence have also been widely investigated, with however inconsistent conclusions. The present study aimed to investigate jointly the temporal trends and the seasonal variations in the month of diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: All the cases of ALL registered in the French National Registry of Childhood Haematological malignancies during 1990-2007 were included in the study. The overall temporal trend and seasonality of ALL were tested with Poisson regression models on 0-14-year-old ALL cases, and specifically on the B-cell precursor ALL (Bcp-ALL) cases. The analyses were also stratified by age groups and gender. RESULTS: Over 1990-2007, a significant time trend in risk of +0.48% (0.02-0.95%) per year for all ALL and +0.85% (0.33-1.37%) for Bcp-ALL was found. The increase was more marked for 7-14-year-old girls with a trend of +2.84% (1.34-4.36%) per year for Bcp-ALL. Seasonal variations were also evidenced for 1-6-year-old boys, with a standardised incidence ratio of 1.11 (1.04-1.18) for Bcp-ALL in April, August and December. CONCLUSION: The study showed an increase in childhood ALL risk over 1990-2007, which tended to be stronger for 7-14-year-old Bcp-ALL, particularly in girls (about one case per year, on average). However, although in accordance with the log-linear assumption, the increase in risk seemed less marked after 2001. The study also suggested seasonal variations in the month of diagnosis for 1-6-year-old boys.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Discovered as a T cell growth factor, IL-2 additionally promotes CD8(+) T cell and natural killer cell cytolytic activity and modulates T cell differentiation programs in response to antigen, promoting naive CD4(+) T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells while inhibiting T helper 17 (Th17) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation. Moreover, IL-2 is essential for the development and maintenance of T regulatory cells and for activation-induced cell death, thereby mediating tolerance and limiting inappropriate immune reactions. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms and complex cellular actions of IL-2, its cooperative and opposing effects with other cytokines, and how both promoting and blocking the actions of IL-2 are being utilized in clinical medicine.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2012 Dec 13.,"This questionnaire study describes the fertility and ovarian function in 143 adult female cancer survivors with only one ovary due to cryopreservation of the other. The women were asked about their ovarian function (as defined by the presence of a spontaneous menstrual cycle), pregnancies and their outcome. The mean follow-up time was 58months after cryopreservation (range 24-129months). The risk of premature ovarian failure was high in the group of patients with leukaemia (13/15; 87%) but low in the breast cancer group (5/54; 9%). Fifty-seven women had actively tried to become pregnant after end of treatment; of these, 41 women obtained a total of 68 pregnancies resulting in 45 live births and five ongoing pregnancies, 15 spontaneous abortions, one ectopic pregnancy and two elective abortions. In the remaining 86 women without a pregnancy wish, there had been five elective abortions. Ninety-three per cent of the pregnancies were after natural conception and only four cases were a result of fertility treatment. The overall risk of premature ovarian failure was low (22%). Patients who retain their ovarian function after treatment of a malignant disease have a good chance of becoming pregnant.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"Following our recent report of attractive antibacterial properties of a designed amphiphilic peptide, A(9)K, we have investigated its antitumor activities by examining the modes of its action against different mammalian cell types. The peptide strongly inhibited the growth of cancerous HeLa cells and human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells whilst remaining benign to the host cells, including Cos 7 cells, mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells and human red blood cells. Images from SEM and fluorescence microscopy showed that A(9)K penetrated HeLa cell membranes and disrupted membrane structures, a feature broadly similar to that observed from its bactericidal actions. Further interactions of A(9)K with inner cellular membranes caused mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the F-actin reorganization and the decreased transcription of bcl-2 and c-myc genes, resulting in HeLa cell apoptosis in a mitochondria-induced apoptosis pathway. Thus A(9)K has high selectivity against cancerous cells and kills them by dual modes of action: membrane disruption and cell apoptosis. In addition, the peptide does not induce non-specific immunological effects and is not degraded by proteases. These features are crucial for developing their applications in future research.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term growth and final height (FH) in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated without cranial radiation therapy and underwent evaluation of growth hormone (GH) status at the end of treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Data on longitudinal growth (collected at the start of treatment, end of treatment, and 1 year thereafter) and FH of 67 adult survivors of childhood ALL who had been treated according to European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 58831/2 protocols with chemotherapy as the only treatment modality were reviewed retrospectively. Height data were expressed as SDS for national references. The relative role of sex, age at diagnosis, intensity of chemotherapeutic regimen, and GH status at the end of treatment as contributing factors were analyzed. RESULTS: A modest but significant loss in FH (change in SDS [DeltaSDS] = -0.59 +/- 0.86; P < .001) was found. Two-thirds of the height deficit observed from diagnosis until FH occurred during treatment. The height deficit was more severe in the male patients (P = .036). The DeltaSDS for height from diagnosis to FH was not correlated with age at diagnosis or intensity of treatment. No correlation was found between the results of the GH stimulation test and DeltaSDS for height from diagnosis or the end of treatment to FH. CONCLUSION: Adult survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapeutic regimens of moderate intensity without cranial radiation therapy exhibit a modest loss in SDS for height at FH irrespective of GH status at the cessation of treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Mosby, Inc.

Here we demonstrated the anticancer activity of ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Pupalia lappacea (L) Juss (Amaranthaceae) (EAPL) on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia K562 cells. METHODS: Antiproliferative activity of EAPL was determined by MTT assay using carvacrol as a positive control. Induction of apoptosis was studied by annexin V, mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometer and modulation in protein levels of p53, PCNA, Bax and Bcl2 ratio, cytochrome c and cleavage of PARP were studied by Western blot analysis. The standardization of the extract was performed through reverse phase-HPLC using Rutin as biomarker. RESULTS: The results showed dose dependent decrease in growth of K562 cells with an IC50 of 40 +/- 0.01 mug/ml by EAPL. Induction of apoptosis by EAPL was dose dependent with the activation of p53, inhibition of PCNA, decrease in Bcl2/Bax ratio, decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in release of cytochrome c, activation of multicaspase and cleavage of PARP. Further HPLC standardization of EAPL showed presence 0.024% of Rutin. CONCLUSION: Present study significantly demonstrates anticancer activity of EAPL on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (K562) cells which can lead to potential therapeutic agent in treating cancer.

On the other hand according to literatures, ADA inhibitors without a nucleoside framework would improve pharmacokinetics and decrease toxicity. Hence we have carried out a rational pharmacophore design for non-nucleoside inhibitors filtration. METHODS: A merged pharmacophore model based on the most potent non-nucleoside inhibitor erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA) and natural products were generated and applied for compounds filtration. The effects of filtrated compounds based on pharmacophore and docking studies investigated on ADA by UV and Fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. RESULTS: Extracted compounds were find efficiently inhibit ADA, and the most potent (2) shows an inhibition constant equal to 20 muM. Besides, Fluorescence spectroscopy studies revealed that enzyme 3D structure bear further change in lower concentrations of compound 2. CONCLUSION: 3 non-nucleoside inhibitors for ADA are presented.

It controls hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. It is indispensable during embryogenesis for the emergence of sites of definitive hematopoiesis and later in mature organisms for bone marrow blood stem cells differentiation. Moreover, RUNX1 gene is a frequent target for chromosomal translocations which cause acute forms of leukemia. A lot of types of human leukemia are somehow associated with mutations in this gene. Nevertheless, to this day the precise mechanism guiding the tissue-specific manner of the RUNX1 gene expression remains unknown. In this review we tried to summarize all the experimental data accumulated during the past twenty years beginning from the date when the cDNA sequence of the RUNX1 gene was first annotated. In the first part of the review we shall focus on structure, isoforms, covalent modifications of the RUNX1 transcription factor and its participation in different regulatory cascades.

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"PURPOSE: In a recent study to purify adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells from acute-type patients by flow cytometry, three subpopulations were observed in a CD3 versus CD7 plot (H: CD3(high)CD7(high); D: CD3(dim)CD7(dim); L: CD3(dim)CD7(low)). The majority of leukemia cells were enriched in the L subpopulation and the same clone was included in the D and L subpopulations, suggesting clonal evolution. In this study, we analyzed patients with indolent-type ATL and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) asymptomatic carriers (ACs) to see whether the CD3 versus CD7 profile reflected progression in the properties of HTLV-I-infected cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patient samples, we performed multi-color flow cytometry. Cells that underwent fluorescence-activated cell sorting were subjected to molecular analyses, including inverse long PCR. RESULTS: In the D(%) versus L(%) plot, patient data could largely be categorized into three groups (Group 1: AC; Group 2: smoldering- and chronic-type ATL; and Group 3: acute-type ATL). Some exceptions, however, were noted (e.g., ACs in Group 2). In the follow-up of some patients, clinical disease progression correlated well with the CD3 versus CD7 profile. In clonality analysis, we clearly detected a major clone in the D and L subpopulations in ATL cases and, intriguingly, in some ACs in Group 2.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"The genetics of lymphoma susceptibility reflect the marked heterogeneity of diseases that comprise this broad phenotype. However, multiple subtypes of lymphoma are observed in some families, suggesting shared pathways of genetic predisposition to these pathologically distinct entities. Using a two-stage GWAS, we tested 530,583 SNPs in 944 cases of lymphoma, including 282 familial cases, and 4,044 public shared controls, followed by genotyping of 50 SNPs in 1,245 cases and 2,596 controls. A novel region on 11q12.1 showed association with combined lymphoma (LYM) subtypes. SNPs in this region included rs12289961 near LPXN, (P(LYM) = 3.89x10(-8), OR = 1.29) and rs948562 (P(LYM) = 5.85x10(-7), OR = 1.29). A SNP in a novel non-HLA region on 6p23 (rs707824, P(NHL) = 5.72x10(-7)) was suggestive of an association conferring susceptibility to lymphoma. Four SNPs, all in a previously reported HLA region, 6p21.32, showed genome-wide significant associations with follicular lymphoma. The most significant association with follicular lymphoma was for rs4530903 (P(FL) = 2.69x10(-12), OR = 1.93). Three novel SNPs near the HLA locus, rs9268853, rs2647046, and rs2621416, demonstrated additional variation contributing toward genetic susceptibility to FL associated with this region. Genes implicated by GWAS were also found to be cis-eQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines; candidate genes in these regions have been implicated in hematopoiesis and immune function. These results, showing novel susceptibility regions and allelic heterogeneity, point to the existence of pathways of susceptibility to both shared as well as specific subtypes of lymphoid malignancy.",,"['Clinical Genetics Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",,,,,,,"['K23 CA115682/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA167824/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA167824/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3547842,,,,,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,

HSCs must be located in their ecological niche (the bone marrow) to function correctly, that is, to regenerate themselves and their progeny; the latter eventually exit the bone marrow and enter circulation. We propose that cells with oncogenic potential-cancer/leukaemia stem cells (LSC)-and their progeny will also occupy this niche. Mathematical models, which describe the dynamics of HSCs, LSCs and their progeny allow investigation into the conditions necessary for defeating a malignant invasion of the niche. Two such models are developed and analysed here. To characterize their behaviour, we use an inferential framework that allows us to study regions in parameter space that give rise to desired behaviour together with an assessment of the robustness of the dynamics. Using this approach, we map out conditions under which HSCs can outcompete LSCs. In therapeutic applications, we clearly want to drive haematopoiesis into such regimes and the current analysis provide some guidance as to how we can identify new therapeutic targets. Our results suggest that maintaining a viable population of HSCs and their progenies in the niche may often already be nearly sufficient to eradicate LSCs from the system.",,"['Theoretical Systems Biology, Division of Molecular Biosciences, Imperial College London, Sir Ernst Chain Building, London SW7 2AZ, UK.']",,,,,,,"['BB/G007934/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",PMC3627104,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide evidence that early-stage B cells in Emu-myc mice are tumorigenic and sharply regress in the periphery between 41 and 65 days of age. Regression depended on CD4(+), CD8(+), NK1.1(+) cells and the activation of the DNA damage response, which has been shown to provide an early barrier against cancer. The DNA damage response can induce ligands that enhance immune recognition. Blockade of DNAM-1, a receptor for one such ligand, impaired tumor regression. Hence, Emu-myc mice provide a model to study spontaneous regression and possible mechanisms of immune evasion or suppression by cancer cells.",,"['Immunology Programme, Centre of Life Sciences, Department of Microbiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",,,,,,,['R01 AI039642/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4260366,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide shows therapeutic effects in subgroups of CLL patients, and is believed to act via the microenvironment. To investigate the effects of lenalidomide on the survival support of NLCs, cocultures of monocytes and CLL cells were treated for 14 days with lenalidomide, which resulted in significantly decreased viability of CLL cells. Among the changes induced by this drug, we observed reduced expression of HLA-DR in NLCs as well as increased secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10), indicating an altered inflammatory milieu in the cocultures. The increase in IL-10 levels lead to an induction of STAT1 phosphorylation in CLL cells and to enhanced cell-surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and altered expression of cytoskeletal and migration-related genes. Chemotaxis assays with lenalidomide-treated CLL cells revealed an impaired migration capability. Our data show that lenalidomide reduces the survival support of NLCs for CLL cells in vitro, suggesting that this drug affects the myeloid microenvironment in CLL in vivo. Furthermore, lenalidomide acts on the migratory potential of CLL cells, which may affect circulation and homing of CLL cells in vivo.",,"['German Cancer Research Center, Division of Molecular Genetics, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed significant toxicity associated with doxorubicin that required optimization of the route of injection as well as the maximum-tolerated dose for immunodeficient strains. Mice treated with an optimized 5-day induction protocol showed transient weight loss, short-term reduction of peripheral blood cell and platelet counts, and slight anemia. Considerable cytotoxicity was observed in the bone marrow (BM), with primitive LSK cells having a significant survival advantage relative to more mature cells, consistent with the idea of chemotherapy targeting actively growing cells. Treated leukemic mice demonstrated reduced disease burden and increased survival, demonstrating efficacy. AML cells showed significantly increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-containing therapy compared with murine BM cells. Although early treatment could result in some cures, mice with significant leukemia grafts were not cured by using induction therapy alone.

Despite the established use of poly-chemotherapy, relapse continues to be the most common cause of death in AML and MDS. The therapeutic elimination of all LSC, as well as pre-LSC, which provide a silent reservoir for the re-formation of LSC, will be essential for achieving lasting cures.

In solid tumors, BRAF-V600E is known to aberrantly activate the oncogenic MEK-ERK pathway, and targeted BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in clinical trials in melanoma patients. However, the MEK-ERK pathway status in hairy cell leukemia has not been thoroughly investigated. We assessed phospho-ERK expression in 37 patients with hairy cell leukemia and 44 patients with neoplasms mimicking hairy cell leukemia (40 splenic marginal zone lymphoma, 2 hairy cell leukemia-variant and 2 splenic lymphoma/leukemia unclassifiable) using immunohistochemistry on routine biopsies and/or Western blotting on purified leukemic cells, and correlated the phospho-ERK status with the BRAF-V600E mutation status. Besides confirming the constant presence of BRAF-V600E in all patients with hairy cell leukemia, we observed ubiquitous phospho-ERK expression in this malignancy. Conversely, all 44 cases with neoplasms mimicking hairy cell leukemia were devoid of BRAF-V600E and none expressed phospho-ERK. Furthermore, the two exceptionally rare cases of non-hairy cell leukemia unclassifiable chronic B-cell neoplasms previously reported to be BRAF-V600E(+) on allele-specific polymerase chain reaction lacked phospho-ERK expression as well, suggesting the presence of the mutation in only a small part of the leukemic clone in these cases. In conclusion, our findings support the use of phospho-ERK immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis between hairy cell leukemia and its mimics, and establish the MEK-ERK pathway as a rational therapeutic target in this malignancy.",,"['Institute of Hematology, Ospedale S.

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"Trithorax and polycomb group proteins antagonistically regulate the transcription of many genes, and cancer can result from the disruption of this regulation. Deregulation of trithorax function occurs through chromosomal translocations involving the trithorax gene MLL, leading to the expression of MLL fusion proteins and acute leukemia. It is poorly understood how MLL fusion proteins block differentiation, a hallmark of leukemogenesis. We analyzed the effect of acute depletion of menin, a close partner of MLL that is critical for MLL and MLL-AF9 recruitment to target genes, on MLL-AF9 leukemia cell differentiation using an in vivo model. We performed cDNA microarray analysis of menin-regulated genes from primary leukemia cells to determine menin-regulated pathways involved in suppressing MLL-AF9 leukemia cell differentiation. We found that menin binds the promoter of the polycomb gene Ezh2, and promotes its expression. EZH2 interacts with the differentiation-promoting transcription factor C/EBPalpha and represses C/EBPalpha target genes. Menin depletion reduces MLL binding to the Ezh2 locus, EZH2 expression, and EZH2 binding and repressive H3K27 methylation at C/EBPalpha target genes, thereby inducing the expression of pro-differentiation C/EBPalpha targets. In conclusion, our results show that in contrast to its classical role antagonizing trithorax function, the polycomb group protein EZH2 collaborates with trithorax-associated menin to block MLL-AF9 leukemia cell differentiation, uncovering a novel mechanism for suppression of C/EBPalpha and leukemia cell differentiation, through menin-mediated upregulation of EZH2.",,"['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",,,,,,,"['T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA105490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA 9140-36/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3669449,,,,['Haematologica. 2013 Jun;98(6):825-7.

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"Inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair pathway manifests as microsatellite instability, an accumulation of mutations that drives carcinogenesis. Here, we determined whether microsatellite instability in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome correlated with chromosomal instability and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor sensitivity through disruption of DNA repair function. Acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (n=12) and primary cell samples (n=18), and bone marrow mononuclear cells from high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients (n=63) were profiled for microsatellite instability using fluorescent fragment polymerase chain reaction. PARP inhibitor sensitivity was performed using cell survival, annexin V staining and cell cycle analysis. Homologous recombination was studied using immunocytochemical analysis. SNP karyotyping was used to study chromosomal instability. RNA silencing, Western blotting and gene expression analysis was used to study the functional consequences of mutations. Acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (4 of 12, 33%) and primary samples (2 of 18, 11%) exhibited microsatellite instability with mono-allelic mutations in CtIP and MRE11. These changes were associated with reduced expression of mismatch repair pathway components, MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1. Both microsatellite instability positive primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and cell lines demonstrated a downregulation of homologous recombination DNA repair conferring marked sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Similarly, bone marrow mononuclear cells from 11 of 56 (20%) patients with de novo high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome exhibited microsatellite instability. Significantly, all 11 patients with microsatellite instability had cytogenetic abnormalities with 4 of them (36%) possessing a mono-allelic microsatellite mutation in CtIP. Furthermore, 50% reduction in CtIP expression by RNA silencing also down-regulated homologous recombination DNA repair responses conferring PARP inhibitor sensitivity, whilst CtIP differentially regulated the expression of homologous recombination modulating RecQ helicases, WRN and BLM. In conclusion, microsatellite instability dependent mutations in DNA repair genes, CtIP and MRE11 are detected in myeloid malignancies conferring hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors.

PTEN inactivation and NOTCH1 activation are known frequent leukemogenic events but their effect on outcome is still controversial. We analyzed the effect of PTEN inactivation and its interaction with NOTCH1 activation on treatment response and long-term outcome in 301 ALL-BFM treated children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We identified PTEN mutations in 52 of 301 (17.3%) of patients. In univariate analyses this was significantly associated with increased resistance to induction chemotherapy and a trend towards poor long-term outcome. By contrast, patients with inactivating PTEN and activating NOTCH1 mutations showed marked sensitivity to induction treatment and excellent long-term outcome, which was similar to patients with NOTCH1 mutations only, and more favorable than in patients with PTEN mutations only. Notably, in the subgroup of patients with a prednisone- and minimal residual disease (MRD)-response based medium risk profile, PTEN-mutations without co-existing NOTCH1-mutations represented an MRD-independent highly significant high-risk biomarker. Mutations of PTEN highly significantly indicate a poor prognosis in T-ALL patients who have been stratified to the medium risk group of the BFM-protocol. This effect is clinically neutralized by NOTCH1 mutations. Although these results have not yet been explained by an obvious molecular mechanism, they contribute to the development of new molecularly defined stratification algorithms. Furthermore, these data have unexpected potential implications for the development of NOTCH1 inhibitors in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in general, and in those with a combination of PTEN and NOTCH1 mutations in particular.",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,PMC3669450,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher numbers of non-classical CD14(+)CD16(++) and Tie-2-expressing monocytes were also detected in patients. Furthermore, we performed a gene expression analysis of monocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, showing up-regulation of RAP1GAP and down-regulation of tubulins and CDC42EP3, which would be expected to result in impairment of phagocytosis. We also detected gene alterations such as down-regulation of PTGR2, a reductase able to inactivate prostaglandin E2, indicating immunosuppressive activity. Accordingly, the proliferation of T cells in contact with monocytes from patients was inhibited compared to that of cells in contact with monocytes from normal controls.

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"Recent advances in unrelated cord blood transplantation have increased chances and options available in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The effect of HLA disparity on outcomes after cord blood transplantation was studied recently in mainly pediatric populations. Results showed that HLA matching in combination with total nucleated cell dose positively affects survival. The effect of HLA disparity after single-unit cord blood transplantation may be different in adults because their total nucleated cell dose is much lower compared to pediatric patients. We investigated the effect of HLA disparity on the outcome of single-unit unrelated cord blood transplantation separately in 498 children aged 15 years or under (HLA-A, HLA-B low-resolution, and HLA-DRB1 high-resolution matched [6/6], n=82, and one locus- [5/6], n=222, two loci- [4/6], n=158, three loci- [3/6] mismatched, n=36) and 1,880 adults (6/6, n=71; 5/6, n=309; 4/6, n=1,025; 3/6, n=475) with leukemia. With adjusted analyses, in children, 4/6 showed significantly increased risks of overall mortality (relative risk [RR]=1.61, P=0.042) and transplant-related mortality (RR=3.55, P=0.005) compared to 6/6. The risk of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD was increased in 5/6 (RR=2.13, P=0.004) and 4/6 (RR=2.65, P<0.001). In adults, the risk of mortality did not increase with the number of mismatched loci (RR=0.99, P=0.944 for 5/6; RR=0.88, P=0.436 for 4/6). The risk of relapse was significantly decreased in 4/6 (RR=0.67, P=0.034). The risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) or acute GVHD was not increased in 5/6 or 4/6. The effect of HLA disparity on transplant outcome differed between children and adults. In children, an increased number of mismatched HLA loci correlated with an increased risk of mortality. In adults, there was no increase in mortality with an increase in the number of mismatched HLA loci.",,"['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Data Management/Biostatistics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya. y-atsuta@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['HLA Working Group of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation'],,,,,,,PMC3640130,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2013 Mar.,"We have previously shown that the presence of trophoblast cells enhances invasiveness of decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells. The metastasis suppressor CD82, which has antimigratory function in tumor cells, is up-regulated in decidualizing endometrial stromal cells. CEACAM1 is expressed in trophoblast cells at the invasion front in early placenta and is considered proinvasive. Here, we investigate the role of CD82 and CEACAM1 in cocultures of the endometrial stromal cell line T-HESC and AC-1M88 trophoblast cells. In transwell migration assays, chemotaxis of AC-1M88 cells was stimulated by coplated T-HESC in the lower compartment or by the combination of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), local factors present at the time of implantation. In an implantation model of AC-1M88 trophoblast spheroids on a monolayer of T-HESC, spheroid expansion was enhanced in the presence of HB-EGF/IL-1beta/LIF. Silencing of CEACAM1 in AC-1M88 blunted this response. Chemotactic migration of T-HESC was stimulated by trophoblast secretions or HB-EGF/IL-1beta/LIF. These responses were suppressed by CD82 depletion in T-HESC. Proteome profiling revealed the presence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA in trophoblast supernatant. Chemotaxis of T-HESC toward PDGF-AA was significantly inhibited by CD82 silencing. Neutralization of PDGF-AA in AC-1M88 conditioned media reduced the chemotactic effect on T-HESC. In summary, we demonstrate a mutual stimulation of chemotactic migration between trophoblast and endometrial stromal cells and promigratory roles for the cell surface molecules CEACAM1 and CD82, which may serve to support tissue remodeling at the implantation site.",,"['Endokrinologikum Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. gellersen@endokrinologikum.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on bone marrow morphology. The presence of fibrosis, JAK2/MPL mutation, or +9/13q- cytogenetic abnormality is supportive but not essential for diagnosis. Prefibrotic PMF mimics essential thrombocythemia in its presentation and the distinction is prognostically relevant. Differential diagnosis of myelofibrosis should include chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. RISK STRATIFICATION: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus (DIPSS-plus) prognostic model for PMF can be applied at any point during the disease course and uses eight independent predictors of inferior survival: age >65 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, leukocytes >25 x 10(9)/L, circulating blasts >/= 1%, constitutional symptoms, red cell transfusion dependency, platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L, and unfavorable karyotype (i.e., complex karyotype or sole or two abnormalities that include +8, -7/7q-, i(17q), inv(3), -5/5q-, 12p-, or 11q23 rearrangement). The presence of 0, 1, ""2 or 3,"" and >/= 4 adverse factors defines low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk disease with median survivals of approximately 15.4, 6.5, 2.9, and 1.3 years, respectively. A >80% two-year mortality is predicted by monosomal karyotype, inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities, or any two of circulating blasts >9%, leukocytes >/= 40 x 10(9)/L or other unfavorable karyotype. Most recently, mutations involving ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, and IDH1/2 or increased plasma IL-2R, IL-8, or serum-free light chain levels have been shown to adversely affect survival. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Observation alone is adequate for asymptomatic low/intermediate-1 risk disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is often considered for high risk disease. Conventional or experimental drug therapy is reasonable for symptomatic intermediate-1 or intermediate-2 risk disease; however, ASCT is an acceptable treatment option for such patients in the presence of ASXL1 or other prognostically adverse mutations. Splenectomy and low-dose radiotherapy are used for drug-refractory splenomegaly. Radiotherapy is also used for the treatment of non-hepatosplenic EMH, PMF-associated pulmonary hypertension, and extremity bone pain.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",,,,['Am J Hematol. 2013 May;88(5):437-45'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The separability parameter is defined as a function of cells' Clausius-Mossotti (CM) factors. T-cell leukemia Jurkat and mouse melanoma B16 cells are tested to validate the separability parameter. CM factors of cells are measured using a recently developed microfluidic impedance spectroscopy device. Separability maps are generated for varying values of field frequency and buffer conductivity. Cell separation is tested using a planar interdigitated electrode array at different buffer conductivities. Impedance measurements of the DEP device are performed at various buffer conductivities. Electrode polarization effects and energy allocation for dielectrophoretic manipulation of cells are computed from the impedance data utilizing an equivalent circuit model. Cell separation results are explained in the light of the impedance measurements.","['(c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study shows that Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) undergoes phosphorylation during mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) or polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) during mitosis prevents PTP1B phosphorylation, implicating these kinases in PTP1B phosphorylation. In support of this, Cdk1 and Plk1 co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous PTP1B from mitotic cells. In addition, active recombinant Cdk1-cyclin B1 directly phosphorylates PTP1B at serine 386 in a kinase assay. Recombinant Plk1 phosphorylates PTP1B on serine 286 and 393 in vitro, however, it requires a priming phosphorylation by Cdk1 at serine 386 highlighting a novel co-operation between Cdk1 and Plk1 in the regulation of PTP1B. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type PTP1B induced mitotic cell death, which is potentiated by MTAs. Moreover, mutation of serine 286 abrogates the cell death induced by PTP1B, whereas mutation of serine 393 does not, highlighting the importance of serine 286 phosphorylation in the execution of mitotic cell death. Finally, phosphorylation on serine 286 enhanced PTP1B phosphatase activity. Collectively, these data reveal that PTP1B activity promotes mitotic cell death and is regulated by the co-operative action of Cdk1 and Plk1 during mitotic arrest.",,"['UCD School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",,,,,,,,PMC3563996,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FCM distinguished HCL-v from HCL and SMZL based solely upon expression of four antigens (CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD123) combined with B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD22). HCL-v expressed bright CD20, bright CD22, CD11c(100%), CD103(100%), dim(40%) or negative(60%) CD123, and uniformly lacked CD25(100%). HCL expressed bright CD20, bright CD22, bright CD11c, bright CD25, CD103, and bright homogeneous CD123(100%). Aberrant expression of CD5(2%/3%), CD10(12%/3%), CD23(21%/11%), CD38(14%/0%), CD2(2%/9%), CD4(0.5%/0%) and CD13(0.5%/3%), was observed in HCL/HCL-v, respectively. SMZL cases were CD103(-) and CD123(-) except for one case with dim CD123. HCL showed significantly greater marrow infiltration over HCL-v. Prominent nucleoli were observed in most HCL-v but rarely in HCL. A third of HCL and HCL-v marrows were hypocellular or aplastic-appearing. Detection of BRAFV600E mutation and annexin A1 were examined in a subset of cases to further validate FCM diagnostic criteria. HCL-v was negative for both annexin A1 (100%) and BRAFV600E mutation (100%), in contrast to HCL (74% positive for annexin A1; 76% positive for BRAFV600E mutation). HCL-v is resistant to traditional HCL therapy, making accurate diagnosis imperative.

To characterize what has been observed in isolated EMR, we investigated 287 consecutive AL patients (144 acute myeloid leukemia; 138 acute lymphocytic leukemia; 5 acute mixed-lineage leukemia) who underwent allo-SCT. Twelve cases experienced relapse at extramedullary sites without concomitant involvement of the bone marrow (BM). The onset to relapse after allo-SCT was longer in extramedullary sites than in the BM (median, 10 months versus 5.5 months). EMR sites varied widely and included the central nervous system, skin, bone, pelvis and breasts. Univariate analysis demonstrated that cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated significantly with the onset of isolated EMR (P=0.001). The prognosis for patients who develop EMR remained poor but was relatively better than that after BM relapse (overall survival, 10 versus 18 months). Compared with local or single therapy, patients treated with systemic treatment in combination with local treatment could yield a favorable prognosis. In conclusion, we observed a significant number of isolated cases of EMR in AL patients after allo-SCT, cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated significantly with the onset of isolated EMR. We found that intensive approaches combining local and systemic therapy could produce favorable responses which may cure a proportion of these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"There is now a plethora of new precision medicines for B-cell malignancy including 'classical' kinase inhibitors, rationally designed inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins and antibody or antibody drug/toxin conjugates with functional properties. Some are showing spectacular single agent activity in early phase clinical studies and may reduce or, in combination, even obviate the need for chemotherapy. Nevertheless, significant problems remain if these medicines are to be introduced into routine clinical practice in a rational and affordable manner. Firstly, precision medicines must be carefully matched in a mechanistic fashion with specific subtypes of disease. Whilst sensitivity may be predicted by the detection of key mutations or by expression of target molecules, for therapies that depend on intact intracellular signalling pathways, functional assessment on viable primary malignant cells will be necessary using assays that faithfully mimic in vivo conditions. A second, but no less important challenge is to define mechanism-based synergistic combinations associated with minimal toxicities rather than simply adding new precision medicines to existing chemotherapeutic regimens. Finally, a closer, open, two-way interaction between academic medicine and the pharmaceutical industry will be necessary to achieve these aims. Implementing such changes would change radically how and where patients with B-cell malignancies are managed.",['(c) 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,['13083/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common reason is poor oral hygiene and high bacterial load that leads to gingival inflammation and enlargement. Other implicated factors include systemic drugs, such as Phenytoin (Dilantin) taken by epileptic patients, Calcium Channel Blockers such as Nifedipine (Procardia) and Verapamil (Calan) for the treatment of hypertension, arrhythmia and angina. Another class of medication associated with gingival enlargement is immunosuppressive agents given to organ-transplant patients to prevent rejection of the new element, such as Cyclosporine. Some enlargements could be associated with other conditions such as puberty, pregnancy or diabetes or be a symptom of a systemic disease (leukemia, Wegener's granulomatosis or sarcoidosis). In rare cases the cause for the enlargement is genetic and termed Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis (HGF). HGF is a genetic disorder characterized by a progressive enlargement of the gingiva. Histologically, the gingiva is characterized by an accumulation of dense fibrous connective tissue. This is believed to be due to an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix composed mainly of collagen molecules or due to an alteration in fibroblast proliferation. Different pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed and examined over the years but no precise process has been identified. The main objective of this paper is to discuss this genetic anomaly and support it with clinical cases of a mother and her two children. It will focus on the clinical and histologic characteristics of HGF as well as known biologic and genetic features and treatment modalities.",,"['Department of Periodontics, College of Dentistry, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. rlivada@uthsc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"Viral tumor models have significantly contributed to our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms. How transforming delta-retroviruses induce malignancy, however, remains poorly understood, especially as viral mRNA/protein are tightly silenced in tumors. Here, using deep sequencing of broad windows of small RNA sizes in the bovine leukemia virus ovine model of leukemia/lymphoma, we provide in vivo evidence of the production of noncanonical RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-transcribed viral microRNAs in leukemic B cells in the complete absence of Pol II 5'-LTR-driven transcriptional activity. Processed from a cluster of five independent self-sufficient transcriptional units located in a proviral region dispensable for in vivo infectivity, bovine leukemia virus microRNAs represent approximately 40% of all microRNAs in both experimental and natural malignancy. They are subject to strong purifying selection and associate with Argonautes, consistent with a critical function in silencing of important cellular and/or viral targets. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are strongly expressed in preleukemic and malignant cells in which structural and regulatory gene expression is repressed, suggesting a key role in tumor onset and progression. Understanding how Pol III-dependent microRNAs subvert cellular and viral pathways will contribute to deciphering the intricate perturbations that underlie malignant transformation.",,"['Unit of Animal Genomics, Groupe Interdisciplinaire Genoproteomique Appliquee, Universite de Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,PMC3568357,,,,,['GEO/GSE42316'],,,,,,,,

Transformation of HSCs by the breakpoint cluster region-ABL tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) oncogene causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The E-twenty six (ets) transcription factor GA binding protein (GABP) is a tetrameric transcription factor complex that contains GABPalpha and GABPbeta proteins. Deletion in bone marrow of Gabpa, the gene that encodes the DNA-binding component, caused cell cycle arrest in HSCs and profound loss of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Loss of Gabpalpha prevented development of CML, although mice continued to generate BCR-ABL-expressing Gabpalpha-null cells for months that were serially transplantable and contributed to all lineages in secondary recipients. A bioinformatic screen identified the serine-threonine kinase protein kinase D2 (PRKD2) as a potential effector of GABP in HSCs. Prkd2 expression was markedly reduced in Gabpalpha-null HSCs and progenitor cells. Reduced expression of PRKD2 or pharmacologic inhibition decreased cell cycling, and PRKD2 rescued growth of Gabpalpha-null BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Thus, GABP is required for HSC cell cycle entry and CML development through its control of PRKD2.

Overall, 153 infectious events were reported during 928 treatment cycles (16.5%) administered to 100 patients. One hundred fourteen, 114/153 (75%) events required hospitalization and 30 (19.6%) were fatal. In a univariate analysis, unfavorable cytogenetics, low neutrophil, hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) counts were found to be associated with infections (24.4% vs. 12.9%, P < 0.0001; 27% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.0001; 20.4% vs. 11%, P < 0.0001 and 29.2% vs. 14.2%, P < 0.0001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, only low Hb level, low PLT count, and unfavorable cytogenetics remained significant. Prior to therapy, poor cytogenetics, PLT count below 20 x 10(9)/L and neutrophil count below 0.5 x 10(9)/L were predictive of the risk of infection during the first two cycles of therapy. In conclusion, patients with unfavorable cytogenetics, presenting with low neutrophil and PLT counts, are susceptible to infections. Evaluation of infection risk should be repeated prior to each cycle. Patients with poor cytogenetics in whom AZA is prescribed despite low PLT count are particularly at high risk for infections and infection prophylaxis may be considered.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Division of Hematology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"In cancer tumors, growth, invasion, and formation of metastasis at a secondary site play a pivotal role, participating in diverse processes in the development of the pathology, such as degradation of extracellular matrix. Bauhinia seeds contain relatively large quantities of peptidase inhibitors, and two Bauhinia inhibitors were obtained in a recombinant form from the Bauhinia bauhinioides species, B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor, which is a cysteine and serine peptidase inhibitor, and B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor, which is a serine peptidase inhibitor. While recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor inhibits human neutrophil elastase cathepsin G and the cysteine proteinase cathepsin L, recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor inhibits plasma kallikrein and plasmin. The effects of recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor on the viability of tumor cell lines with a distinct potential of growth from the same tissue were compared to those of the clinical cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil. At 12.5 microM concentration, recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor were more efficient than 5-fluorouracil in inhibiting MKN-28 and Hs746T (gastric), HCT116 and HT29 (colorectal), SkBr-3 and MCF-7 (breast), and THP-1 and K562 (leukemia) cell lines. Additionally, recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor inhibited 40 % of the migration of Hs746T, the most invasive gastric cell line, while recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor did not affect cell migration. Recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor, even at high doses, did not affect hMSC proliferation while 5-fluorouracil greatly reduced the proliferation rates of hMSCs. Therefore, both recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor might be considered for further studies to block peptidase activities in order to target specific peptidase-mediated growth and invasion characteristics of individual tumors, mainly in patients resistant to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy.",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"Cladribine has been used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia for about 30 years. In addition, the number of indications for the application of 2-CdA is constantly increasing. The treatment with cladribine, of younger persons and even children, appears to be a major factor stimulating the more exact recognition of its activities. However, till now, little has been known about the impact of cladribine on the reproductive system. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of cell proliferation and apoptosis markers in ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells. In our study, ten rats were placed into two equal groups. The study group received daily subcutaneous injections of cladribine in a dose of 0.10 mg/kg of weight/day for one cycle lasting 7 days. The control group received only saline injections. The rats were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection, and their ovaries were extracted. The sections were immunohistochemically stained with cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and the apoptosis marker caspase 3. The expressions of the markers were evaluated using a light microscope. An analysis was made using an image analysis system and the CellAD software. The results were then statistically explored by way of the Mann-Whitney U test. The proliferative index (Ki-67) of ovarian surface epithelial cells was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that cladribine treatment has a potential to inhibit the OSE cell proliferation in rats. The apoptosis marker demonstrated a significant increase after the cladribine treatment. These suggest that cladribine induces apoptosis in OSE cells.",,"['Department of Mathematics and Biostatistics, Medical University of Lublin, 20-090, Lublin ul. K.

The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) is frequently overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma which correlates with chemotherapy resistance. It has been demonstrated that Bcl-x(L) cooperates with another anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, to protect ovarian cancer cells against apoptosis, and that their concomitant inhibition induces massive cell death. Here, we examined the interest of ABT-737, a potent BH3-mimetic molecule targeting Bcl-x(L), both alone and in combination with Mcl-1 modulators, in ovarian cancer cell lines. As a single agent, ABT-737 was ineffective at promoting cell death in the four cell lines we tested in vitro. However, the specific inhibition of Mcl-1 by siRNA dramatically increased the sensitivity of chemoresistant cells to ABT-737. Platinum compounds also sensitize to ABT-737 by dose-dependently decreasing Mcl-1 expression or by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Noxa and, to a lower extent, Bim. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Noxa accumulation was involved in apoptosis occurring in response to the combination of ABT-737 and platinum compounds, since cells were protected from apoptosis by its silencing. Moreover, the combination was also highly cytotoxic ex vivo in sliced SKOV3 tumor nodes. However we observed in these slices a strong basal expression of Noxa and apoptotic cell death in response to ABT-737 alone. Therefore, we have revealed that the modulation of the Mcl-1/Noxa axis by platinum compounds results in a strong sensitization of chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells to ABT-737, which could constitute a promising therapeutic in these cancers.",,"['Unite Biologie et Therapies Innovantes des Cancers Localement Agressifs (EA 4656, Universite de Caen Basse-Normandie et SF 4206 ICORE), Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, 3 Avenue du General Harris, BP 5026, 14076 Caen Cedex 05, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 24.,"The frequent serious bleeding and thrombotic complications in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are major causes of early mortality, but the complex mechanisms causing the bleeding have not been completely elucidated. Because microparticles (MPs) are known to be elevated in thromboembolic disorders, we hypothesized a role for MPs in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in APL. MPs were isolated from 30 APL patients and 20 healthy subjects and from cultured NB4/APL cells. The morphology of the MPs was examined, and they were quantified and analyzed for their thrombin-generating potential. We confirmed the existence of promyelocytic-derived MPs by morphology using transmission electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Counts of MPs in APL were elevated and were typically from promyelocytic cells (CD33(+) TF(+) MPs). Importantly, the CD33(+) MPs strongly correlated with patient leukocyte count (R = 0.64, p = 0.002) and D-dimer (R = 0.51, p = 0.0038). Moreover, the MPs from patients with APL decreased the coagulation times and induced thrombin generation. APL MP-associated thrombin generation was reduced by 54 % when the extrinsic pathway was blocked using an anti-human tissue factor (TF) antibody. However, neither anti-factor XI nor anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor had any significant inhibitory effect. Our results show that the procoagulant state in APL is partially due to the TF-dependent procoagulant properties of circulating promyelocytic-derived MPs. TF(+) MPs may be a novel potential risk factor for coagulopathy in APL.",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we explored the effect of persistent HIF-1alpha inhibition by a lentivirus short hairpin RNA pool on MM cell growth either in vitro or in vivo and on the transcriptional and pro-angiogenic profiles of MM cells. HIF-1alpha suppression did not have a significant impact on MM cell proliferation and survival in vitro although, increased the antiproliferative effect of lenalidomide. On the other hand, we found that HIF-1alpha inhibition in MM cells downregulates the pro-angiogenic genes VEGF, IL8, IL10, CCL2, CCL5 and MMP9. Pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines were also inhibited, such as IL-7 and CCL3/MIP-1alpha. The effect of HIF-1alpha inhibition was assessed in vivo in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice both in a subcutaneous and an intratibial MM model. HIF-1alpha inhibition caused a dramatic reduction in the weight and volume of the tumor burden in both mouse models. Moreover, a significant reduction of the number of vessels and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) immunostaining was observed. Finally, in the intratibial experiments, HIF-1alpha inhibition significantly blocked bone destruction. Overall, our data indicate that HIF-1alpha suppression in MM cells significantly blocks MM-induced angiogenesis and reduces MM tumor burden and bone destruction in vivo, supporting HIF-1alpha as a potential therapeutic target in MM.",,"['Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",,,,,,,"['R01 AR059679/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AR057308/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We update a large study of reinforced plastic industry workers with relatively high exposures to styrene, examining cancer risks associated with exposure levels. The study includes 15,826 workers who were exposed between 1948 and 1977 with vital-status follow-up from 1948 to 2008. We examine mortality rates associated with cumulative exposure, duration of exposure, peak exposures, average exposure, and time since first exposure to styrene. Exposure estimates were truncated starting in 1977, the period with the lowest exposures, leaving 27% of the study group with incomplete work histories. RESULTS: The standardized mortality ratios were 0.84 (95% confidence interval = 0.69-1.02) for all lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers combined, 0.72 (0.50-1.00) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 0.84 (0.60-1.14) for leukemia. There was no trend with either cumulative exposure to styrene or number of peaks. Pancreatic cancer deaths were at expected levels (0.96 [0.73-1.22]). There were more lung cancer deaths than expected (1.34 [1.23-1.46]), although with a marked inverse trend with cumulative exposure.

A total of 36,394 diagnostic radiation workers (159,189 person-years) were included in this study; the effective dose and cancer incidence were analyzed between the period 1996 and 2002. Median (range) follow-up time was 5.5 (0.04-7) years in males and 3.75 (0.04-7) years in females. Cancer risk related to the average annual effective dose and exposure to more than 5 mSv of annual radiation dose were calculated by the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for occupation and age at the last follow-up. The standardized incidence ratio of cancer in radiation workers showed strong healthy worker effects in both male and female workers. The relative risk of all cancers from exposure of the average annual effective dose in the highest quartile (upper 75% or more of radiation dose) was 2.14 in male workers (95% CI: 1.48-3.10, p-trend: <0.0001) and 4.43 in female workers (95% CI: 2.17-9.04, p-trend: <0.0001), compared to those in the lower three quartiles of radiation exposure dose (less than upper 75% of radiation dose). Cancer risks of the brain (HR: 17.38, 95% CI: 1.05-287.8, p-trend: 0.04) and thyroid (HR: 3.88, 95% CI: 1.09-13.75, p-trend: 0.01) in female workers were significantly higher in the highest quartile group of radiation exposure compared to those in the lower three quartiles, and the risk of colon and rectum cancers in male workers showed a significantly increasing trend according to the increase of the average annual radiation dose (HR: 2.37, 95% CI: 0.99-5.67, p-trend: 0.02).

This review describes available treatments and recent advances that may influence the clinical management of t-MDS/AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple retrospective studies have identified poor-risk cytogenetics, chemotherapy resistance, comorbidities from prior cancer and therapy, and persistence of the primary malignancy as factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes of t-MDS/AML. Recent analyses show that t-MDS/AML can respond to standard therapy, but responses are less durable. In most cases, cure is made more likely with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. These findings suggest that improved survival may result from earlier, low-intensity nontransplant therapy, and aggressive pursuit of reduced-intensity transplant approaches in eligible individuals coupled with posttransplant relapse prevention strategies. Molecular characterization of t-MDS/AML may aid future clinical management decisions and identify targets for therapy. SUMMARY: Data emerging from recent t-MDS/AML studies are shedding light on factors that contribute to disease biology and poor clinical outcomes. These findings can be used to develop strategies to improve the treatment and survival of patients with t-MDS/AML.",,"['Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA. klimekv@mskcc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, APL-associated thrombosis is relatively underappreciated. We aimed to explore the issue of APL-associated thrombosis events. In the past 20 years, 127 cases with APL were found in our hospital database. We collected their coagulation laboratory profiles, including leukemia burdens, white blood cell and platelet counts, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen levels, and disseminated intravascular coagulation scores. Data were compared between patients with or without thrombosis. Clinical outcomes and potential risk factors were obtained for analysis. Ten cases with APL-associated thrombosis were found. The incidence of thrombosis was 7.9% in our cohort. Five patients had cerebral infarction, 5 had catheter-related thrombosis and 1 had acute myocardial infarction. No laboratory data were associated with clinical thrombosis. Three patients died during the induction phase but thrombosis was not the direct cause of death for any of them. We conclude that patients with APL are susceptible to thrombosis in addition to bleeding. Laboratory coagulation parameters did not predict thrombosis in our series. Ischemic stroke and catheter-related thrombosis were the most common events in our Taiwanese cohort. Such a thrombosis pattern is unique and worth further investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Thus, we sought to identify a surrogate stem cell niche for the isolation and persistent maintenance of stable clonal cardiovascular progenitor cell lines, enabling us to study the mechanism of self-renewal and differentiation in these cells. Using postnatal murine hearts with a selectable marker as the stem cell source and embryonic stem cells and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-secreting fibroblasts as a surrogate niche, we succeeded in the isolation of stable clonal cardiovascular progenitor cell lines. These cell lines self-renew in an LIF-dependent manner. They express both stemness transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog and early myocardial transcription factors Nkx2.5, GATA4, and Isl-1 at the same time. Upon LIF deprivation, they exclusively differentiate to functional cardiomyocytes and endothelial and smooth muscle cells, suggesting that these cells are mesodermal intermediates already committed to the cardiogenic lineage. Cardiovascular progenitor cell lines can be maintained for at least 149 passages over 7 years without phenotypic changes, in the presence of LIF-secreting fibroblasts.

Subjects with Down syndrome (DS) have a higher incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) while solid tumors, like breast cancer (BC) and oral cancer (OC), show rare incidences. Triplication of the human chromosome 21 in DS is associated with altered genetic dosage of different TFs. V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2 (ETS2) and Single Minded 2 (SIM2) are two such TFs that regulate several downstream genes involved in developmental and neurological pathways. Here we studied functional genetic polymorphisms (fSNP) in ETS2 and SIM2 encoding genes in a group of patients and control subjects to better understand association of these variants with DS phenotypes. METHODS: We employed an in silico approach to identify potential target pathways of ETS2 and SIM2. fSNPs in genes encoding for these two TFs were identified using available databases. Selected sites were genotyped in individuals with DS, their parents, ALL, BC, OC as well as ethnically matched control individuals. We further analyzed these data by population-based statistical methods. RESULTS: Allelic/genotypic association analysis showed significant (P < 0.03) differences of rs2070530, rs1051476, rs11254, rs711 for DS subjects compared to control. rs711 also exhibited significantly different genotypic distribution pattern in parents of DS probands (P < 0.02) and BC patients (P < 0.02). Interaction analysis revealed independent main effect of rs711 in all the groups, while rs11254 exhibited independent main effect in DS subjects only. High entropy values were noticed for rs461155 in the solid tumor groups. Significant interactive effects of rs2070531 with rs1051475, rs1051476, rs11254 were observed in all the groups except DS. CONCLUSIONS: We infer from the present investigation that the difference in frequencies of fSNPs and their independent as well as interactive effects may be the cause for altered expression of SIM2 and ETS2 in DS and malignant groups, which affects different downstream biological pathways. Thus, altered expression of SIM2 and ETS2 could be one of the reasons for variable occurrence of different malignant conditions in DS.",,"['Manovikas Biomedical Research and Diagnostic Centre, MRIH, Kolkata, India.']",,,,,,,,PMC3563522,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aim to identify pathways of frequently mutated genes by exploiting their network neighborhood encoded in the protein-protein interaction network. To this end, we introduce a multi-scale diffusion kernel and apply it to a large collection of murine retroviral insertional mutagenesis data. The diffusion strength plays the role of scale parameter, determining the size of the network neighborhood that is taken into account. As a result, in addition to detecting genes with frequent mutations in their genomic vicinity, we find genes that harbor frequent mutations in their interaction network context. RESULTS: We identify densely connected components of known and putatively novel cancer genes and demonstrate that they are strongly enriched for cancer related pathways across the diffusion scales. Moreover, the mutations in the clusters exhibit a significant pattern of mutual exclusion, supporting the conjecture that such genes are functionally linked. Using multi-scale diffusion kernel, various infrequently mutated genes are found to harbor significant numbers of mutations in their interaction network neighborhood. Many of them are well-known cancer genes. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the importance of defining recurrent mutations while taking into account the interaction network context. Importantly, the putative cancer genes and networks detected in this study are found to be significant at different diffusion scales, confirming the necessity of a multi-scale analysis.",,"['Delft Bioinformatics Lab, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,PMC3626877,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In this work we show that C3G and Bcr-Abl form complexes with the focal adhesion (FA) proteins CrkL, p130Cas, Cbl and Abi1 through SH3/SH3-b interactions. The association between C3G and Bcr-Abl decreased upon Abi1 or p130Cas knock-down in K562 cells, which suggests that Abi1 and p130Cas are essential partners in this interaction. On the other hand, C3G, Abi1 or Cbl knock-down impaired adhesion to fibronectin, while p130Cas silencing enhanced it. C3G, Cbl and p130Cas-SH3-b domains interact directly with common proteins involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies revealed that C3G form complexes with the FA proteins paxillin and FAK and their phosphorylated forms. Additionally, C3G, Abi1, Cbl and p130Cas regulate the expression and phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK. p38alpha MAPK also participates in the regulation of adhesion in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. It interacts with C3G, CrkL, FAK and paxillin and regulates the expression of paxillin, CrkL and alpha5 integrin, as well as paxillin phosphorylation. Moreover, double knock-down of C3G/p38alpha decreased adhesion to fibronectin, similarly to the single silencing of one of these genes, either C3G or p38alpha. These suggest that C3G and p38alpha MAPK are acting through a common pathway to regulate cell adhesion in K562 cells, as previously described for the regulation of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that C3G-p38alphaMAPK pathway regulates K562 cell adhesion through the interaction with FA proteins and Bcr-Abl, modulating the formation of different protein complexes at FA.",,"['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC, CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. maporras@farm.ucm.es.']",,,,,,,,PMC3629710,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Kinetics and dynamics of bioluminescence signal were cell line dependent. Luciferase expression decreased significantly over time in polyclonal leukemia cells in vitro. Transplantation of polyclonal luciferase-tagged cells in mice resulted in inconsistent signal intensity. After selection of monoclonal cell populations, luciferase activity was stable, equal kinetic and dynamic of bioluminescence intensity and strong correlation between cell number and light emission in vitro were observed.

It is necessary to determine the concentration of arsenic due to its toxicity. The profiles of arsenic speciation in patients with relapsed or refractory APL have been demonstrated in few reports. Arsenic metabolite concentrations in the plasma of patients with newly diagnosed APL during the first course of arsenic remission induction therapy were determined, and the complicated change pattern of these metabolite concentrations in this phase is described for the first time in this study. We demonstrated that the concentration of trivalent inorganic arsenic (As(III)), which is regarded as the most effective and toxic, was much lower than those of other metabolites. Concentrations of the same arsenic metabolites were obviously distinct among various individuals. We infer that determination of the metabolites separately is necessary, and cannot be replaced by total arsenic determination. In addition, the amount of methylated metabolites of arsenic increased during the first course of ATO therapy, and these metabolites might therefore play an increasingly important role. Further research should be carried out to study the relationship between arsenic metabolite concentrations and efficacy, as well as side effects in patients with APL treated with ATO.",,"['Department of Hematology, First Affi liated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Sep;54(9):1864-6.

We have shown recently that a majority of patients with acute-type ATLL have multiple subclones that were likely produced in lymph nodes. In this study, we analyzed whether PTCL, NOS with genomic aberrations also has multiple subclones as found in ATLL by means of high-resolution oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Thirteen cases of PTCL, NOS were available for 44K high-resolution array CGH analysis. The results showed that 11 (84.6%) of the 13 cases had a log2 ratio imbalance, suggesting that multiple subclones exist in PTCL, NOS with genomic aberrations. In order to analyze the association between multiple subclones and prognosis, we used previous bacterial-artificial chromosome (BAC) array analyses for 29 cases and found that the existence of multiple subclones was associated with a poor prognosis (P = 0.0279).",,"['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute Chikusa-ku, Kanokoden 1-1, Nagoya, 464-8681, Japan; Department of Cancer Genetics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine Showa-ku, Tsurumai 65, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Multiple subclones, not otherwise specified', 'oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization', 'peripheral T-cell lymphoma']",,PMC3544466,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20130124']

The present study aims to correlate leukemia-associated hypercoagulability to high level plasma sEPCR and proposes its measurement in routine clinical practice. EPCR expressions in leukemic cell lines were determined by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). EPCR gene sequence of a candidate cell line HL-60 was also determined. Plasma samples (n = 76) and bone marrow aspirates (n = 72) from 148 patients with hematologic malignancies and 101 healthy volunteers were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) via a retrospective study for sEPCR and D-dimer. All leukemic cell lines were found to express EPCR. Also, HL-60 EPCR gene sequence showed extensive similarities with the endothelial reference gene. All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) originally described and some new SNPs were revealed in the promoter and intronic regions. Among these patients 67% had plasma sEPCR level higher than the controls (100 +/- 28 ng/mL), wherein 16.3% patients had experienced a previous thrombotic event. These patients were divided into: group-1 (n = 45) with amount of plasmatic sEPCR below 100 ng/mL, group-2 (n = 45) where the concentration of sEPCR was between 100 and 200, and group-3 (n = 20) higher than 200 ng/mL. The numbers of thrombotic incidence recorded in each group were four, six, and eight, respectively. These results reveal that EPCR is expressed not only by a wide range of human malignant hematological cells but also the detection of plasma sEPCR levels provides a powerful insight into thrombotic risk assessment in cancer patients, especially when it surpasses 200 ng/mL.",,"['INSERM, UMRS 872, CRC, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['D-dimer', 'EPCR (CD201)', 'leukemia', 'protein C', 'thrombosis']",,PMC3544449,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20130124']

Platinum analogues have also shown activity in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) histology, but clinical data are limited. Here we report the long-term follow-up of a phase II study on TNBC treated with a combined modality therapy, including induction with AT, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) with concurrent radiation therapy, and a dose-dense consolidation chemotherapy (HDCT) with carboplatin (CBDCA), ifosfamide (IFX), etoposide (VP-16). Patients' median age was 44 years, with 73% premenopausal. Epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) were administered to 70 patients with TNBC: as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to 12 and 58 patients, respectively. Postoperative radiation therapy, 5000 cGy, was delivered, synchronous with triweekly CMF. After radiation therapy, two courses of HDCT with CBDCA, IFX, VP-16, were given, with hematological growth factors. After a median follow-up of 81 months, all patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Most important toxicity were grade 3 skin reaction and grade 4 hematological in 3% and 31% of patients, respectively. Pathological complete response was observed in 25% of patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment failures were as follows: eight visceral, four contralateral breast cancer, four locoregional, and one leukemia. Five-year progression-free survival and overall survival rate were 78% and 91%, respectively. Induction chemotherapy, followed by chemoradiation therapy and HDCT, provides a prolonged disease-free period and a significant increase in overall survival in TNBC, with an acceptable toxicity profile.",,"['Oncology Unit, Civilian Hospital Avezzano, Italy; Carlo Ferri Foundation Monterotondo, Rome, Italy. frecchia1946@libero.it']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy', 'high-dose chemotherapy', 'platinum analogues', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",,PMC3544434,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20130124']

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"The identification of novel combinations of effective cancer drugs is required for the successful treatment of cancer patients for a number of reasons. First, many ""cancer specific"" therapeutics display detrimental patient side-effects and second, there are almost no examples of single agent therapeutics that lead to cures. One strategy to decrease both the effective dose of individual drugs and the potential for therapeutic resistance is to combine drugs that regulate independent pathways that converge on cell death. BCL2-like family members are key proteins that regulate apoptosis. We conducted a screen to identify drugs that could be combined with an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic BCL2-like proteins, ABT-263, to kill human leukemia cells lines. We found that the combination of D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) hydrochloride, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, potently synergized with ABT-263 in the killing of multiple human leukemia cell lines. Treatment of cells with PDMP and ABT-263 led to dramatic elevation of two pro-apoptotic sphingolipids, namely ceramide and sphingosine. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, SKi-II, also dramatically synergized with ABT-263 to kill leukemia cells and similarly increased ceramides and sphingosine. Data suggest that synergism with ABT-263 requires accumulation of ceramides and sphingosine, as AMP-deoxynojirimycin, (an inhibitor of the glycosphingolipid pathway) did not elevate ceramides or sphingosine and importantly did not sensitize cells to ABT-263 treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that combining inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL2-like proteins with drugs that alter the balance of bioactive sphingolipids will be a powerful combination for the treatment of human cancers.",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States of America.']",,,,,,,"['8P20 GM103482-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK093462/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR17677/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017677/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MH084681/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103482/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA138313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3546986,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, insufficient understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing human HSC has precluded the development of effective protocols for culturing HSC for therapeutic use and molecular studies. We defined a culture system using OP9M2 mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) stroma that protects human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) from differentiation and apoptosis. In addition, it facilitates a dramatic expansion of multipotent progenitors that retain the immunophenotype (CD34+CD38-CD90+) characteristic of human HSPC and proliferative potential over several weeks in culture. In contrast, transplantable HSC could be maintained, but not significantly expanded, during 2-week culture. Temporal analysis of the transcriptome of the ex vivo expanded CD34+CD38-CD90+ cells documented remarkable stability of most transcriptional regulators known to govern the undifferentiated HSC state. Nevertheless, it revealed dynamic fluctuations in transcriptional programs that associate with HSC behavior and may compromise HSC function, such as dysregulation of PBX1 regulated genetic networks. This culture system serves now as a platform for modeling human multilineage hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell hierarchy and studying the complex regulation of HSC identity and function required for successful ex vivo expansion of transplantable HSC.",,"['Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.']",,,,,,,"['HL086345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM007185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'T32 GM007185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL086345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL097766-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL097766/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3547050,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with an increased risk of developing second cancers. However, it is unknown whether CLL alters the disease course of these cancers once they occur. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with cancers of the breast (n = 579,164), colorectum (n = 412,366), prostate (n = 631,616), lung (n = 489,053), kidney (n = 95,795), pancreas (n = 82,116), and ovary (n = 61,937) reported to the SEER program from 1990 to 2007 were identified. Overall survival (OS; death resulting from any cause) and cancer-specific survival were examined, comparing patients with and without pre-existing CLL. Cancer-specific survival was evaluated for each tumor type in a site-specific manner (eg, death resulting from breast cancer in a patient with breast cancer). RESULTS: Patients with cancers of the breast (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; P < .001), colorectum (HR, 1.65; P < .001), kidney (HR, 1.54; P < .001), prostate (HR, 1.92; P < .001), or lung (HR, 1.19; P < .001) had inferior OS if they had a pre-existing diagnosis of CLL after adjusting for age, sex, race, and disease stage. These results for OS remained significant for patients with cancers of the breast, colorectum, and prostate after excluding or censoring CLL-related deaths. Cancer-specific survival was also inferior for patients with cancers of the breast (HR, 1.41; P = .005) and colorectum (HR, 1.46; P < .001) who had pre-existing CLL after adjusting for age, sex, race, and disease stage. CONCLUSION: Inferior OS and cancer-specific survival was observed for several common cancers in patients with pre-existing CLL. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal management of these malignancies in patients with CLL and whether more aggressive screening or alternative approaches to adjuvant therapy are needed.",,"['Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are important inhibitors of apoptosis in human cancer and are targets for novel anticancer agents such as the Bcl-2 antagonists, ABT-263 (Navitoclax), and its analog ABT-737. Unlike Bcl-2, Mcl-1 is not antagonized by ABT-263 or ABT-737 and is considered to be a major factor in resistance. Also, Mcl-1 exhibits differential regulation when compared with other Bcl-2 family members and is a target for anticancer drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate that BAG3, an Hsp70 co-chaperone, protects Mcl-1 from proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting its antiapoptotic activity. Using neuroblastoma cell lines, with a defined Bcl-2 family dependence, we found that BAG3 expression correlated with Mcl-1 dependence and ABT-737 resistance. RNA silencing of BAG3 led to a marked reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in Mcl-1-dependent cells. In ABT-737-resistant cells, Mcl-1 co-immunoprecipitated with BAG3, and loss of Mcl-1 after BAG3 silencing was prevented by proteasome inhibition. BAG3 and Mcl-1 were co-expressed in a panel of diverse cancer cell lines resistant to ABT-737. Silencing BAG3 reduced Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in several of the cell lines, including triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) and androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer (PC3) cells. These studies identify BAG3-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization as a potential target for cancer drug discovery.",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, Center in Molecular Toxicology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",,,,,,,"['CA97323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA097323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES013125/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 ES013125/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES000267/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3591608,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"Identification of cell type-specific enhancers is important for understanding the regulation of programs controlling cellular development and differentiation. Enhancers are typically marked by the co-transcriptional activator protein p300 or by groups of cell-expressed transcription factors. We hypothesized that a unique set of enhancers regulates gene expression in human erythroid cells, a highly specialized cell type evolved to provide adequate amounts of oxygen throughout the body. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing, genome-wide maps of candidate enhancers were constructed for p300 and four transcription factors, GATA1, NF-E2, KLF1, and SCL, using primary human erythroid cells. These data were combined with gene expression analyses, and candidate enhancers were identified. Consistent with their predicted function as candidate enhancers, there was statistically significant enrichment of p300 and combinations of co-localizing erythroid transcription factors within 1-50 kb of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of genes highly expressed in erythroid cells. Candidate enhancers were also enriched near genes with known erythroid cell function or phenotype. Candidate enhancers exhibited moderate conservation with mouse and minimal conservation with nonplacental vertebrates. Candidate enhancers were mapped to a set of erythroid-associated, biologically relevant, SNPs from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalogue of NHGRI, National Institutes of Health. Fourteen candidate enhancers, representing 10 genetic loci, mapped to sites associated with biologically relevant erythroid traits. Fragments from these loci directed statistically significant expression in reporter gene assays. Identification of enhancers in human erythroid cells will allow a better understanding of erythroid cell development, differentiation, structure, and function and provide insights into inherited and acquired hematologic disease.",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520; Departments of Pathology and Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.

Epub 2013 Mar 13.,"Aberrant expression and function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in leukemia have added a new layer of complexity to the understanding of development and progression of the disease state. However, their targeting of specific signaling pathways responsible for the maintenance and survival properties of leukemic stem cell (LSC) still remains to be further clarified. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a highly conserved developmental pathway, has been proven as a functional pathway for LSCs, and loss of this pathway impairs the development of BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and depletes CML stem cells. Here, we revealed that upregulation of the Hh smoothened (Smo) signal transducer was associated with reduced expression of miR-326 in the CD34(+) cells from a group of patients with CML at diagnosis. Additionally, overexpression of miR-326 led to downregulation of Smo, resulted in decreased cell proliferation and elevated rate of apoptosis in CML CD34(+) cells. Interestingly, restoration of Smo expression levels reversed the effect of miR-326 and rescued K562 cells from the antiproliferative effects of this miRNA. Thus, Smo appears to be an essential target of miR-326 during the pathogenesis of CML. These findings lead us to suggest that downregulation of miR-326 may be a possible mechanism for unrestricted activation of Smo signal transducer of the oncogenic Hh pathway in CML; therefore, the restoration of miR-326 expression could be of benefit in eradicating CD34(+) CML stem/progenitor cells that represent a potential source of relapse in patients suffering CML.",['Copyright (c) 2013 UICC.'],"['Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease. The diagnosis is predominantly based on immunophenotyping. In addition to known cytogenetic abnormalities molecular mutations were recently identified. Here, 90 adult T-ALL cases were investigated for mutations in NOTCH1, FBXW7, PHF6, CDKN2A, DNMT3A, FLT3, PTEN, and RUNX1 using 454 next-generation amplicon sequencing and melting curve analyses. These data were further complemented by FISH, chromosome banding, array CGH, and CDKN2B promoter methylation analyses. NOTCH1 was the most frequently mutated gene with a 71.1% frequency followed by FBXW7 (18.9%), PHF6 (39.5%), DNMT3A (17.8%), RUNX1 (15.5%), PTEN (10.0%), CDKN2A (4.4%), FLT3-ITD (2.2%), and FLT3-TKD (1.1%). In total, 84/90 (93.3%) cases harbored at least one mutation. Combining these data with CDKN2A/B deletions and CDKN2B methylation status, we detected minimum one aberration in 89/90 (98.9%) patients. Survival analyses revealed the subtype as defined by the immunophenotype as the strongest independent prognostic factor. When restricting the survival analysis to the early T-ALL subtype, a strong association of RUNX1 (P = 0.027) and DNMT3A (P = 0.005) mutations with shorter overall survival was observed. In conclusion, RUNX1 and DNMT3A are frequently mutated in T-ALL and are associated with poor prognosis in early T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377 Munich, Germany. vera.grossmann@mll.com']",,,,['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2015 Oct;54(10):653.

Epub 2013 Jan 23.,"Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of skin cancer and its incidence rate is still increasing. All existing treatments are minimally effective. Consequently, new therapeutic agents for melanoma treatment should be developed. The DM-1 compound is a curcumin analog that possesses several curcumin characteristics, such as antiproliferative, antitumor, and anti-metastatic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the different signaling pathways involved in the cytotoxic effect of DM-1 on melanoma cells. The apoptotic process and cytoskeletal changes were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, respectively, in melanoma cells. After DM-1 treatment, SK-MEL-5 melanoma cells showed actin filament disorganization with spicule formation throughout the cytoskeleton and significant reduction of focal adhesion as well as they were present only at cell extremities, conferring a poor connection between the cell and the substrate. Besides this, there was significant filopodium retraction and loss of typical cytoskeleton scaffold. These modifications contributed to cell detachment followed by cell death. Furthermore, DM-1-induced apoptosis was triggered by multiple Bcl-2 proteins involved in both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. SK-MEL-5 cells showed a death mechanism mainly by Bcl-2/Bax ratio decrease, whereas A375 cells presented apoptosis induction by Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL downregulation. In SK-MEL-5 and A375 melanoma cells, there was a significant increase in the active form of caspase 9, and the inactive form of the effector caspase 3 was decreased in both cell lines. Expression of cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase was increased after DM-1 treatment in these melanoma cell lines, demonstrating that the apoptotic process occurred. Altogether, these data elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the cytotoxicity induced by the antitumor agent DM-1 in melanoma cells.",,"['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Butantan Institute, 1500 Vital Brasil Avenue, Sao Paulo, 05503-900, Brazil. feflor@uol.com.br']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"RAD51 recombinase activity plays a critical role for cancer cell proliferation and survival, and often contributes to drug-resistance. Abnormally elevated RAD51 function and hyperactive homologous recombination (HR) rates have been found in a panel of cancers, including breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Directly targeting RAD51 and attenuating the deregulated RAD51 activity has therefore been proposed as an alternative and supplementary strategy for cancer treatment. Here we show that a newly identified small molecule, IBR2, disrupts RAD51 multimerization, accelerates proteasome-mediated RAD51 protein degradation, reduces ionizing radiation-induced RAD51 foci formation, impairs HR, inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis. In a murine imatinib-resistant CML model bearing the T315I Bcr-abl mutation, IBR2, but not imatinib, significantly prolonged animal survival. Moreover, IBR2 effectively inhibits the proliferation of CD34(+) progenitor cells from CML patients resistant to known BCR-ABL inhibitors. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors of RAD51 may suggest a novel class of broad-spectrum therapeutics for difficult-to-treat cancers.","['Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors.

At the chronic phase (CP), CML cells present longer telomeres than at the other clinical phases, display arm-specific maintenance of individual telomere lengths, and are chromosomally stable. We asked whether an alteration of nuclear organization of telomeres, which is associated with genomic instability, occurs in CML cells at the CP. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization of telomeres combined with three-dimensional (3D) quantification to study the nuclear telomeric architecture of CML cells at the CP. We found that cells can exhibit high telomere numbers, different telomere distributions, and alterations in peripheral or central nuclear location of telomeres. Also, we show that CML cells can be categorized in two groups according to the number of their telomere aggregates (TAs). We propose that the presence of high TAs in some samples is associated with the increased genomic instability and could be an indication of the clinical transitional phase. Also, alterations of nuclear organization of telomeres at the CP confirm that nuclear remodeling of telomeres can occur at an early clinical stage of a cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Division of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, its role in the induction of chromosomal instability is poorly understood. We established a leukemia model by retrovirally expressing Myc in wild-type and histone methyltransferase Suv39h1-deficient hematopoietic cells and characterized the resulting leukemias for chromosomal instability. All mice that received cells overexpressing Myc developed myeloid leukemia with a median survival of 44 days posttransplantation. Myc-overexpressing wild-type leukemias demonstrated clones with numerical chromosomal aberrations (5/16). In secondary transplantations of these leukemic cells, structural changes, mostly end-to-end fusions of chromosomes, appeared (10/12). In contrast, leukemic cells overexpressing Myc with reduced or no Suv39h1 expression had a normal karyotype in primary, secondary, and tertiary transplantations (16/16). Myc-transduced Suv39h1-deficient cells showed less critically short telomeres (P < 0.05) compared with Myc-transduced wild-type bone marrow cells. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of genes involved in the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. Thus, we hypothesize that loss of Suv39h1 implies activation of the ALT mechanism, in turn ensuring telomere length and stability. Our data show for the first time that Suv39h1 deficiency may prevent chromosomal instability by more efficient telomere stabilization in hematopoietic bone marrow cells overexpressing Myc.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation or over-expression of the FLT3 gene, leading to constitutive signalling, enhances the survival and expansion of a variety of leukaemias and is associated with an unfavourable clinical outcome for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. In this study, we used a murine cellular model for AML and primary leukaemic cells from AML patients to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of FLT3 gene expression and identify its key cis- and trans-regulators. By assessing DNA accessibility and epigenetic markings, we defined regulatory domains in the FLT3 promoter and first intron. These elements permit in vivo binding of several AML-related transcription factors, including the proto-oncogene MYB and the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein C/EBPalpha, which are recruited to the FLT3 promoter and intronic module, respectively. Substantiating their relevance to the human disease, our analysis of gene expression profiling arrays from AML patients uncovered significant correlations between FLT3 expression level and that of MYB and CEBPA. The latter relationship permits discrimination between patients with CEBPA mono- and bi-allelic mutations, and thus connects two major prognostic factors for AML.",,"['Institute of Biomedical Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",,,,,,,"['084330/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0501688/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K01076X/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC4214120,['EMS60644'],,,,,,,,,['NLM: EMS60644'],,,

This study assessed its efficacy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia pre-treated with an alkylator, in comparison to fludarabine. Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia requiring treatment after one previous systemic regimen (usually chlorambucil-based) were randomized to either receive bendamustine 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle or standard fludarabine treatment consisting of 25 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5 every 4 weeks. The primary objective was to achieve non-inferior progression-free survival (PFS) with bendamustine. Out of a total of 96 patients randomized, 92 were eligible, 49 allocated to bendamustine and 43 to fludarabine. About half of the patients received six or more cycles. Overall response rates were 76 % on bendamustine and 62 % on fludarabine, with clinical complete response rates of 27 and 9 %, respectively. Median PFS was 20.1 and 14.8 months (hazard ratio, 0.87; 90 % confidence interval, 0.60-1.27), median overall survival 43.8 and 41.0 months (hazard ratio, 0.82). Thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicities were marginally more frequent on bendamustine, albeit CTC grade 3/4 event incidence was similar. These data suggest at least comparable efficacy of bendamustine vs. fludarabine, pointing to an alternative treatment option in relapsing CLL patients after chlorambucil containing initial chemotherapy.",,"['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Leverkusen gGmbH, Am Gesundheitspark 11, Leverkusen, Germany. niederle@klinikum-lev.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEBL was the second Nebulin family member (LASP1, NEBL) which was found to be involved in MLL rearrangements. Here, we report on our attempts to unravel the oncogenic properties of both fusion genes. First, RT-PCR analyses revealed the presence of the MLL-NEBL and NEBL-MLL mRNAs in the diagnostic sample of the patient. Next, expression cassettes for MLL-NEBL and NEBL-MLL were cloned into a sleeping beauty vector backbone. After stable transfection, the biological effects of MLL-NEBL, NEBL-MLL or the combination of both fusion proteins were investigated in a conditional cell culture model. NEBL-MLL but also co-transfected cells displayed significantly higher growth rates according to the data obtained by cell proliferation assay. The focus formation experiments revealed differences in the shape and number of colonies when comparing MLL-NEBL, NEBL-MLL- and co-transfected cells.

Epub 2013 Jan 19.,"Small molecule inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2) are currently being pursued as potential new modes of therapy for a variety of diseases, including the inhibition of JAK2 for the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders. Selective inhibition within the JAK family can be beneficial in avoiding undesirable side effects (e.g., immunosuppression) caused by parallel inhibition of other JAK members. In an effort to design an assay paradigm for the development of JAK2 selective inhibitors, we investigated whether compound selectivity differed between cellular and purified enzyme environments. A set of JAK2 inhibitors was tested in a high-throughput JAK family cell assay suite and in corresponding purified enzyme assays. The high-throughput JAK cell assay suite comprises Ba/F3 cells individually expressing translocated ETS leukemia (TEL) fusions of each JAK family member (TEL-JAK Ba/F3) and an AlphaScreen phosphorylated-STAT5 (pSTAT5) immunoassay. Compound potencies from the TEL-JAK Ba/F3 pSTAT5 assays were similar to those determined in downstream cell proliferation measurements and more physiologically relevant cytokine-induced pSTAT5 PBMC assays. However, compound selectivity data between cell and purified enzyme assays were discrepant because of different potency shifts between cell and purified enzyme values for each JAK family member. For any JAK small molecule development program, our results suggest that relying solely on enzyme potency and selectivity data may be misleading. Adopting the high-throughput TEL-JAK Ba/F3 pSTAT5 cell assay suite in lead development paradigms should provide a more meaningful understanding of selectivity and facilitate the development of more selective JAK inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2013 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Cytogenetic and molecular assays have allowed patients' follow up aiming for detection of minimal residual disease, prediction of patients' outcome, in addition to providing the rationale for designing novel molecular-targeted therapeutic strategies. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), encoded by the hTERT gene and the telomerase RNA component (hTERC) genes are frequently amplified in human tumors, which may indicate that the hTERT and the hTERC genes may be target for amplification during the transformation of human malignancies including hematological malignancies. This genetic event has implications in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics of cancer. To evaluate the hTERC and hTERT genes as a prognostic marker in patients with AML, hTERC and hTERT gene amplification was studied in 20 adult AML patients using a commercial FISH probes (Kreatech) designated to detect the copy numbers of the genes. They were 12 males and 8 females. Their ages ranged from 16 to 67 years. The patients were further divided into two groups; group I (12 patients) includes newly diagnosed AML patients and group II (8 patients) includes patients taken at 28th day of chemotherapy. The hTERC amplification was detected in 19/21 cases (90.5%). The copy number of the gene ranged from 2-5 copies per interphase cell. For the hTERT gene, the amplification was found in the same percent of the patients. The copy number of the gene ranged from 2-9 copies per interphase cell. On comparing the group I with group II there was a highly statistical significant difference regarding the percent of amplification of both genes. The percent of amplification of hTERT gene was found to be higher among patients with poor outcome of the disease than in patients with good outcome. On the contrary the hTERC gene amplification did not exhibit such a correlation. In conclusion, hTERT and hTERC genes amplification were detected in patients with AML; therefore telomerase can be a good cancer marker which may be involved in carcinogenesis of leukemia. Higher amplification was found in de novo cases than cases in remission which emphasize its role in clinical analysis, disease monitoring and detection of minimal residual disease.

Compound 3k exhibited the most potent growth inhibition against melanoma MDA-MB-435 cells (GI(50)=850 nM), against leukemia SR cancer cells (GI(50)=1.45 muM), and OVCAR-3 (GI(50)=1.26 muM) ovarian cancer cell lines. The structurally related compound 3s had a GI(50) value of 1.77 muM against MDA-MB-435 cells. The N-naphthoyl analogue 3t had GI(50) values of 1.30 and 1.91 muM against HOP-92 non-small cell lung cancer and MDA-MB-435 melanoma cell lines, respectively. The related analogue 3w had GI(50) values of 1.09 muM against HOP-92 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, docking of the two active molecules 3k and 3w into the active site of COX-2 indicates that these compounds are COX-2 ligands with strong hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Thus, compounds 3k, 3t, 3s, and 3w constitute a new class of anticancer/anti-inflammatory agents that may have unique potential for cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"Glucocorticoids exert rapid nongenomic effects by several mechanisms including the activation of a membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptor (mGR). Here, we report the first proteomic study on the effects of mGR activation by BSA-conjugated cortisol (Cort-BSA). A subset of target proteins in the proteomic data set was validated by Western blot and we found them responding to mGR activation by BSA-conjugated cortisol in three additional cell lines, indicating a conserved effect in cells originating from different tissues. Changes in the proteome of BSA-conjugated cortisol treated CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were associated with early and rapid pro-apoptotic, immune-modulatory and metabolic effects aligning with and possibly ""priming"" classical activities of the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (cGR). PCR arrays investigating target genes of the major signaling pathways indicated that the mGR does not exert its effects through the transcriptional activity of any of the most common kinases in these leukemic cells, but RhoA signaling emerged from our pathway analysis. All cell lines tested displayed very low levels of mGR on their surface. Highly sensitive and specific in situ proximity ligation assay visualized low numbers of mGR even in cells previously thought to be mGR negative. We obtained similar results when using three distinct anti-GR monoclonal antibodies directed against the N-terminal half of the cGR. This strongly suggests that the mGR and the cGR have a high sequence homology and most probably originate from the same gene. Furthermore, the mGR appears to reside in caveolae and its association with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) was clearly detected in two of the four cell lines investigated using double recognition proximity ligation assay. Our results indicate however that Cav-1 is not necessary for membrane localization of the GR since CCRF-CEM and Jurkat cells have a functional mGR, but did not express this caveolar protein. However, if expressed, this membrane protein dimerizes with the mGR modulating its function.",,"['Institute of Immunology, Centre de Recherche Public de la Sante/Laboratoire National de Sante, Luxembourg, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.']",,,,,,,,PMC3708164,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular modeling studies were performed with the use of HyperChem and Dragon software. The structures of the compounds were firstly pre-optimized with the MM+ mechanics and semi-empirical AM1 method procedure included in the HyperChem and resulting geometrical structures were studied with the use of Dragon software, and several molecular descriptors of acridinones were calculated and used as predictor (independent) variables in the MARS model building. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select the training and test sets. The optimal MARS model uses 28 basis functions to describe acridinones' antitumor activity and characterized high correlation between predicted antitumor activity and that one from biological experiments for the data used in the training and testing sets of acridinones with correlation coefficients on the level of 0.9477 and 0.9660, respectively. Generally, results showed that MARS model provided powerful capacity of prediction of antitumor activity of acridinone derivatives. Moreover, a physicochemical explanation of the descriptors selected by MARSplines analysis is also given, and indicated that molecular parameters describing 3-D properties as well as lipophilicity of acridinone derivative molecule are important for acridinones antitumor activity.",,"['Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum of Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland. kobamar@cm.umk.pl.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Mar 14.,"Metastatic spread in Ewing sarcomas (ES) is frequent and haematogenous. G-protein coupled receptor 64 (GPR64), an orphan receptor with normal expression restricted to human epididymis is specifically over-expressed in ES among sarcoma, but also up-regulated in a number of carcinomas derived from prostate, kidney or lung. Inhibition of GPR64 expression in ES by RNA interference impaired colony formation in vitro and suppressed local tumour growth and metastasis in Rag2(-/-) gammaC (-/-) mice. Microarray analysis after GPR64 knock down revealed a GPR64-mediated repression of genes involved in neuronal development like SLIT, drosophila, homolog of, 2 (SLIT2), and genes regulating transcription including pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 2 (PBX2). Concurrently, the suppression of GPR64 increased ES susceptibility to TRAIL induced apoptosis. Moreover, a GPR64-mediated induction of placental growth factor (PGF) in ES was observed. PGF suppression by RNA interference resulted in a reduction of metastatic growth similar to that observed after GPR64 knock down. Importantly, inhibition of GPR64 as well as PGF expression was associated with a reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and invasiveness in vitro. Furthermore, MMP1 knock down abrogated lung metastasis in Rag2(-/-) gammaC (-/-) mice.

Epub 2013 Jan 15.,"In our previous study, SET was identified as one of the differentially expressed proteins that was associated with tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As4S4)-induced NB4-R1 [retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line] apoptosis. However, the mechanism through which SET regulates pathways during this process remains unclear. The aim of this study was to construct lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against SET and investigate the effect of SET on As4S4-induced retinoic acid-resistant APL cell apoptosis. In the present study, 4 different oligonucleotides targeting the human SET gene were synthesized and cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pGCSIL-GFP. The recombinant vectors were introduced into NB4-R1 cells. The silencing efficiency was measured by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. Our results showed that the 4 recombinant RNA interference (RNAi) vectors were constructed successfully. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that infection efficiency ranged from 70 to 90%. Infection with the 4 different RNAi vectors significantly knocked down the expression of SET by 52.8, 69.1, 48.9 and 90.3% at the mRNA level, and 92.5, 96.3, 91.7 and 98.4% at the protein level, respectively.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"Over the past half-century, the incidence of tumours has increased, resulting in cancer becoming one of the most lethal diseases in humans. In the present study, we elucidated the status of oncology research from 2001 to 2010. Studies published in 30 representative oncology journals were retrieved from the Web of Science (2001-2010) to compose our dataset. Knowledge domain visualisation, co-citation analysis and social network analysis methods were used. By mapping the oncology research performed from 2001 to 2010, we identified the primary research centres, including the top 20 institutions and countries and the 4 major oncology research fronts: i) the mechanism of abnormal oncogene expression; ii) tumour metastasis and angiogenesis; iii) the relationship between cancer cells and apoptosis; and iv) tumour vaccines. We also identified the 36 most collaborative academic communities, and multiple myeloma, angiogenesis and acute lymphocytic leukaemia were found to be the focuses of collaborative research in oncology from 2001 to 2010. Over the past 10 years, America has led oncology research, while China is the sole developing country to be ranked in the top 10. Analyses of the main research centres and forefronts may assist researchers in addressing these forefronts and ascertaining the developing trends in oncology. Analysis of the academic communities performing oncology research may provide scientific evidence and suggestions for policymakers to select the most prolific academic groups and leaders and to effectively manage and finance future oncology research. These selected groups and individuals will carry out additional joint undertakings and solve complex problems encountered in oncology research.",,"['School of Public Health, Department of Information Management, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No statistical difference was observed. In the study group, there was a slight increase in protein Z levels between the PZ0 and PZ1 periods in which only steroid therapy was administered. Statistically significant decrease was observed between protein Z levels in PZ0-PZ4, PZ1-PZ2, PZ1-PZ3, PZ1-PZ4 and PZ3-PZ4 periods. During the induction treatment, symptomatic haemorrhage or thrombosis was not followed up in any patients.

We conducted a prospective surveillance study on children with cancer admitted to the pediatric hematology and oncology units at a public pediatric hospital in Mexico from January 2004 to December 2009. The incidence of HAIs and groups at greatest risk for HAIs were analyzed. The annual HAI incidence rate and incidence density were calculated. Risk factors such as site of infection, HAI types, and cancer diagnosis were studied. A total of 9420 patients participated, and 409 had HAIs (479 episodes). Annual HAI rates were 3.7 to 5.5 per 100 admissions and the incidence density was 5.75 to 6 HAIs per 1000 inpatient days annually. There were 272 (56.8%) bloodstream infections, 45 (9.4%) pneumonia cases, and 44 (9.2%) skin and soft tissue infections. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had 37.2% and those with acute myeloid leukemia had 16.4% of the HAIs. A total of 11.5% of the HAIs were in children with osteosarcoma. The most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria. The HAI-associated mortality rate was 3.7%.

However, a number of patients have CML that is resistant to Imatinib treatment. In this report, we developed AGM130 as a potential therapeutic drug for Imatinib-resistant CML treatment. The AGM130 compound is derived from Indirubin, which is an ingredient of Danggui Longhui Wan and known as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. The water solubility of AGM130 is more enhanced than that of the original form of Indirubin, which has very poor water solubility. Our data showed that the AGM130 compound efficiently decreased the viability of CML-derived K562 cells. Moreover, this compound also efficiently decreased the viability of Imatinib-resistant K562 cells in in vitro and in vivo systems. In addition, like Indirubin, AGM130 also inhibited phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is a major substrate of CDK. Conclusively, our data suggest that AGM130 is a strong candidate for treating Imatinib-resistant CML.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Since shortening remission duration caused by resistance to chemotherapy often becomes clinically critical problems, development of novel and effective therapy should be required. The present study investigated the status of NF-kappaB and effect of its inhibitor, bortezomib, in six canine neoplastic lymphoid cell lines. NF-kappaB p65 and p50 were detected in the nuclear fraction of GL-1, CLBL-1 and CL-1, suggesting that NF-kappaB was constitutively activated in the cells. NF-kappaB p65 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of UL-1 and Ema. After incubation with bortezomib, NF-kappaB p50 and p65 became undetectable in the nuclear fraction of GL-1, CLBL-1 and CL-1, and CLBL-1, respectively, and p65 was clearly degraded in the cytoplasmic fraction of CLBL-1 and CL-1. Bortezomib inhibited the proliferation of all cell lines except Nody-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The results indicated that constitutive activation of NF-kappaB could contribute to the proliferation of canine neoplastic lymphoid cells, and bortezomib would have suppressive effects on the NF-kappaB activation and the proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells in dogs.",,"['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for associations with adult cancers is weaker and inconsistent. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to investigate risks of adult cancers in relation to distance and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields from high-voltage overhead power lines using National Cancer Registry Data in England and Wales, 1974-2008. The study included 7823 leukemia, 6781 brain/central nervous system cancers, 9153 malignant melanoma, 29,202 female breast cancer cases, and 79,507 controls frequency-matched on year and region (three controls per case except for female breast cancer, one control per case) 15-74 years of age living within 1000 m of a high-voltage overhead power line. RESULTS: There were no clear patterns of excess risk with distance from power lines. After adjustment for confounders (age, sex [except breast cancer], deprivation, rurality), for distances closest to the power lines (0-49 m) compared with distances 600-1000 m, odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.82 (95% confidence interval = 0.61-1.11; 66 cases) for malignant melanoma to 1.22 (0.88-1.69) for brain/central nervous system cancer. We observed no meaningful excess risks and no trends of risk with magnetic field strength for the four cancers examined. In adjusted analyses at the highest estimated field strength, >/=1000 nanotesla (nT), compared with <100 nT, ORs ranged from 0.68 (0.39-1.17) for malignant melanoma to 1.08 (0.77-1.51) for female breast cancer.

METHODS: The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was employed in 177 AL cases and 390 controls. RESULTS: The presence of the mutant 1298C, also RFC 80A, was linked to a decreased risk of developing acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (odds ratio (OR)=0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.30-071 and OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.28-0.0.93, respectively).

Epub 2013 Jan 22.,"AIMS: This prospective, cross-sectional study aimed to assess cancer pain and its management in an inpatient setting at a comprehensive cancer centre in Denmark. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-eight inpatients with cancer were invited to participate (May/June 2011). Demographics, diagnoses, World Health Organization performance status, health-related quality of life, pain and data regarding analgesic treatment were registered. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four (71.3%) patients agreed to participate in the study. Most frequent diagnoses were leukaemia (27.6%) and lung cancer (14.2%). A high prevalence of pain was observed, 65.7%. Thirty-two per cent reported moderate to severe pain when it was at its worst, 96% reported no or mild pain when it was at its least. Nearly 22% reported moderate to severe pain when the pain was categorised as average. Breakthrough pain episodes were reported by 30.5%. Adjuvant medication was sparsely used and not always correctly indicated. Out of 88 patients with pain, 62.5% were left untreated according to the Electronic Medication System. Higher health-related quality of life was associated with lower pain intensity. The use of opioids with or without adjuvants was associated with higher pain intensity and higher number of breakthrough pain episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately two thirds of inpatients reported pain and one third had breakthrough pain. A substantial number of patients with pain were left untreated. Opioid-treated patients reported highest pain intensity and number of breakthrough episodes; however, analgesic medication seemed to be underused. Measures to improve pain assessment and management are highly required.",['(c) 2013 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.'],"['Section of Palliative Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. geana@rh.regionh.dk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 20 children with CML who had received allo-HSCT was analyzed retrospectively to investigate possible prognostic factors, including age, sex, interval between diagnosis and transplantation, HLA matching between donors and recipients, illness status on transplantation and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, 13 of the 20 treated children had disease-free survival (DFS) and the rest (7 cases) died. Four died of severe acute GVHD, two of chronic GVHD and its complications, and one of relapse after transplantation. The three-year DFS was (64.6+/-1.1%). As shown by the univariate analysis, age was the most important prognostic factor in children with CML who had received allo-HSCT (P<0.05), and in children over 10 years, the prognosis was poor. No other of the above factors had a significant impact on prognosis (P>0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis also confirmed age as the only prognostic factor (P<0.01). Severe acute and/or chronic GVHD was the most important cause of patient death. 10/10 HLA-matched donors could improve the transplantation outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Allo-HSCT is an effective treatment for children with CML. To improve the prognosis and treatment outcome, children with CML aged over 10 years should receive allo-HSCT as early as possible. 10/10 HLA-matched donors are preferred in allo-HSCT and GVHD should be prevented.",,"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China. jiang_hua18@yahoo.com.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As it relates to thiopurine therapy, genetic polymorphisms of TPMT are strongly associated with the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of thiopurines (mercaptopurine and azathioprine), influencing their toxicity and efficacy. We have recently demonstrated that TPMT and ITPA genotypes constitute a multilocus genotype of pharmacogenetic relevance for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving thiopurine therapy. The use of high-throughput genomic analysis allows identification of additional candidate genetic factors associated with pharmacogenetic phenotypes, such as TPMT enzymatic activity: PACSIN2 polymorphisms have been identified by a genome-wide analysis, combining evaluation of polymorphisms and gene expression, as a significant determinant of TPMT activity in the HapMap CEU cell lines and the effects of PACSIN2 on TPMT activity and mercaptopurine induced adverse effects were confirmed in children with ALL. Combination of genetic factors of relevance for thiopurine metabolizing enzyme activity, based on the growing understanding of their association with drug metabolism and efficacy, is particularly promising for patients with pediatric ALL.

Patients with hairy cell leukemia usually present with splenomegaly, progressive pancytopenia and a relative indolent clinical course. The diagnosis does not always indicate immediate treatment, as treatment depends on the clinical stage of the leukemia. Asymptomatic disease without progression requires a watchful waiting policy, while other categories usually need treatment. The treatment of choice is purine nucleoside analogues (pentostatin, cladribine) which can achieve complete remission even for decades. Interferon and monoclonal CD20 antibodies can also significantly prolong event-free survival. Unfortunately, only the latter two therapies are easily available in Hungary. Splenectomy, which was suggested as first line treatment before the era of purine nucleoside analogues, is only recommended as a last resort. Although hairy cell leukemia is a well-defined lymphoproliferative disease, sometimes it is difficult to differentiate it from other similar entities such as hairy cell leukema variant, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma etc. Making the correct diagnosis is of utmost importance because of the great difference in treatment modalities. Recently, a somatic mutation was found in all analysed hairy cell leukemia samples, but not in other splenic B-cell lymphomas.

However, human cytomegalovirus can manipulate this central innate interaction through the provision of a ""mimic"" of the HLA-encoded peptide derived from the immunomodulatory glycoprotein UL40. Here, we analyzed UL40 sequences isolated from 32 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients experiencing cytomegalovirus reactivation. The UL40 protein showed a ""polymorphic hot spot"" within the region that encodes the HLA leader sequence mimic. Although all sequences that were identical to those encoded within HLA-I genes permitted the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 receptors, other UL40 polymorphisms reduced the affinity of the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 receptors. Furthermore, functional studies using NK cell clones expressing either the inhibitory receptor CD94-NKG2A or the activating receptor CD94-NKG2C identified UL40-encoded peptides that were capable of inhibiting target cell lysis via interaction with CD94-NKG2A, yet had little capacity to activate NK cells through CD94-NKG2C.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of combination chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) and asparaginase is not well known in relapsed and refractory acute leukemia after contemporary therapy. PROCEDURE: A retrospective study of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received MTX and asparaginase as a salvage therapy at St. Jude Children Research Hospital was performed. MTX was given intravenously followed by a dose of asparaginase intramuscularly or intravenously 24 hours later. The chemotherapy cycle was repeated every 7-10 days. Response, survival, and toxicities were evaluated. RESULTS: Fifteen patients, median age 10.5 years (range, 1.1-18.5 years), were treated. Median number of previous therapeutic regimens was three (range, 1-4). Six patients responded to treatment (three had morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, two had partial remission, and one had stable disease for 16 months), and four are still alive. Three of six responders had monoblastic leukemia, and also developed tumor lysis syndrome. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates are 35.6% and 17.8%, respectively. The most common adverse event was transient elevation of transaminases (nine patients). Two patients developed pancreatitis. Episodes of febrile neutropenia were rare (two patients), and most courses (75 out of 93 total courses) were given in an outpatient setting. CONCLUSIONS: Combination chemotherapy with MTX and asparaginase appears to be an effective salvage therapy and well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory childhood AML, even in those heavily pretreated with contemporary frontline or salvage therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-3678, USA.""]",,,,,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4005561,['NIHMS546955'],,,,,,,,,,,,

SF3B1 mutations are most frequent (~80%) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but lack prognostic relevance. SRSF2 mutations are associated with shortened overall (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in both MDS and myelofibrosis. In this study of 226 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mutational frequencies were 40% for SRSF2 (all affecting P95), 6% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and 9% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R). These mutations were mutually exclusive and 54% of the patients displayed at least one mutation. The three mutation groups were phenotypically similar, with the exception of higher RS% (P < 0.0001) in patients with SF3B1 mutations. At a median follow-up of 15 months, 176 (78%) deaths and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented. OS (median survivals of 17, 16, 17, and 20 months; P = 0.48) and LFS (leukemic transformation rates of 17, 13, 15, and 5%; P = 0.63) were similar among patients with none of the three mutations, SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35 mutations, respectively. We conclude that SRSF2 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in CMML but neither it nor SF3B1 or U2AF35 mutations are prognostically relevant.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 18.,"The transcription factor Ikaros regulates the development of hematopoietic cells. Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy, which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",,,,,,,"['P50 GM081892/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3612856,,,,['Blood. 2013 Mar 28;121(13):2376-7.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"BACKGROUND: The discovery of effective re-induction regimens for children with more than one relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains elusive. The novel nucleoside analog clofarabine exhibits modest single agent efficacy in relapsed ALL, though optimal combinations of this agent with other active chemotherapy drugs have not yet been defined. Herein we report the response rates of relapsed ALL patients treated on Children's Oncology Group study AAML0523, a Phase I/II study of the combination of clofarabine and cytarabine. PROCEDURE: AAML0523 enrolled 21 children with ALL in second or third relapse, or those refractory to re-induction therapy. The study consisted of two phases: a dose finding phase and an efficacy phase. The dose finding portion consisted of a single dose escalation/de-escalation of clofarabine for 5 days in combination with a fixed dose of cytarabine (1 g/m(2)/day for 5 days). Eight patients received clofarabine at 40 mg/m(2)/day and 13 patients at 52 mg/m(2)/day. RESULTS: Toxicities observed at all doses of clofarabine were typical of intensive chemotherapy regimens for leukemia, with infection being the most common. We did not observe significant hepatotoxicity as reported in other clofarabine combination regimens. The recommended pediatric Phase II dose of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine for the efficacy portion of AAML0523 was 52 mg/m(2). Of 21 patients with ALL, 3 (14%) achieved a complete response (CR). Based on the two-stage design definition of first-stage inactivity, the therapy was deemed ineffective. CONCLUSION: The combination of clofarabine and cytarabine in relapsed/refractory childhood ALL does not warrant further clinical investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","[""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. todd.cooper@choa.org""]",,,,,,,"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4605828,['NIHMS723527'],,,,,,,,,,,,

THE AIMS OF OUR STUDY WERE: (1) to assess QoL in long-term survivors (LTSs) of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas compared to age-matched controls from the general population (NORMs). (2) To investigate factors associated with poor QoL in LTSs. PROCEDURE: This population-based cross-sectional study enrolled 285 LTSs of ALL and lymphomas diagnosed between 1970 and 2002 at age <18 years. The LTSs completed an extensive mailed questionnaire including the Short Form 36 (SF-36) as QoL-measure. NORMs consisted of five age-matched controls for each LTS (N = 1,425). Poor QoL was defined as SF-36 physical or mental component summary score <40. RESULTS: The median age of LTSs' at survey was 30 years (range: 18-54), median follow-up time 21 years (range: 7-39). Compared to NORMs, LTSs scored significantly lower on 7 of 8 SF-36 subscales. Among LTSs 32% reported poor QoL versus 19% among NORMs (P < 0.001). Among LTSs, psychosocial, lifestyle- and health-related variables, but not type of malignancy, treatment factors or socio-demographic factors were clinically significantly associated with poor QoL in bivariate regression analyses. In multivariate analysis, levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression, as well as obesity and insomnia remained significantly associated with poor QoL. CONCLUSION: Significantly more LTSs than age-matched NORMs experienced poor QoL. Clinically significant associations with fatigue, anxiety, depression, obesity and insomnia were observed, which may be amenable for interventions, and thereby improvement of QoL in LTSs.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","[""Department of Paediatric Medicine, Women and Children's Division, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway. adriani.kanellopoulos@medisin.uio.no""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.5% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4%), cancers of the stomach (3.1%) and colorectum (3.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American Cancer Society, Inc.']","['Surveillance Information, Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA 30303-1002, USA.

The goal of our study was to investigate the expression of membrane form of HLA-G in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) before and after therapy in a trial to evaluate its role as a tumor escape mechanism and prognosis. So we measured its expression by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 25 (ALL) patients and 15 healthy controls and correlated our findings with a variety of clinical and laboratory variables and two important cytokines, IL-10 and INF-gamma, and with natural killer (NK) cells. Serum levels of IL-10 and INF-gamma were measured by ELISA. NK cells were quantitated by flow cytometry. The best cutoff values for the investigated markers were determined by ROC curve. The current study showed that membrane-bound HLA-G expression levels and positivity rates above the cutoff value 0.37 were significantly higher in ALL patients at diagnosis compared to after therapy and both showed significant higher levels than in normal control group (P < 0.01). Moreover, IL-10 and INF-gamma serum levels were significantly elevated in ALL patients at time of diagnosis compared to healthy controls with a significant reduction in their levels in ALL patients after receiving chemotherapy. Membrane HLA-G expression showed a significant positive correlation with lactate dehydrogenase, peripheral and bone marrow blast cells and with IL-10 and INF-gamma. The positive correlation of membrane HLA-G expression with both IL-10 and INF-gamma serum levels supports the speculation that both cytokines may be involved in the control of HLA-G expression. HLA-G showed a negative correlation with NK cells confirming its importance in tumor escape through down-regulation of NK cells. In conclusion, HLA-G expression could be used as a prognostic tumor marker to monitor disease state and improvement in ALL.",,"['Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Abbasia, Cairo, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their levels have been regarded as prognostic markers of the progression of disease. The objective of the present study was to assess whether polymorphisms located within the genes coding for these key angiogenic activators contribute to disease susceptibility and/or progression in patients with B-CLL. For this purpose, 180 individuals were investigated, including 68 B-CLL patients and 112 healthy controls. All individuals were typed for the VEGF (936 C > T) and bFGF (-921 C > G) alleles using PCR-RFLP technique. Only a slight prevalence of the VEGF T variant was observed among patients as compared to healthy individuals (p = 0.095) with a significant difference when high risk (stage III/IV) patients were considered (OR = 3.81, p = 0.045). No other significant association was observed between the VEGF polymorphism and progression of the disease. The VEGF alleles and genotypes segregated similarly in patients with different stage of the disease according to Rai classification. No significant relationships were also observed for the bFGF polymorphism with either susceptibility to B-CLL (when compared to control group) or progression of the disease.

Epub 2013 Jan 19.,"To date, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) shows very poor outcome for conventional chemotherapy. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are insensitive to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and play a central role in the pathogenesis of AML. Failure to effectively ablate these cells may lead to AML relapse following chemotherapy. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is constructively activated in LSCs. This pathway can be inhibited by PI-103, a novel synthesized molecule of the pyridofuropyrimidine class, resulting in the apoptosis of LSCs. Therefore, we investigate the influences of PI-103 in combination with daunorubicin (DNR) on the LSCs. Our data indicate that PI-103 synergistically sensitizes LSCs to DNR-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, the PI-103/DNR co-treatment can induce significant apoptosis in LSCs, but sparing hematopoietic stem cells. The synergistic effect and the LSCs-specific apoptosis mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Our results suggest that PI-103 in combination with DNR may be a potent and less toxic therapy for targeting LSCs and deserve further preclinical and clinical studies in the treatment of AML.",,"['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080 Guangdong, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"BACKGROUND: The DNA methylating agent temozolomide was developed primarily for treatment of glioblastoma. However, preclinical data have suggested a broader application for treatment of childhood cancer. Temozolomide was tested against the PPTP solid tumor and ALL models. PROCEDURES: Temozolomide was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1,000 microM and was tested against the PPTP in vivo panels at doses from 22 to 100 mg/kg administered orally daily for 5 days, repeated at day 21. RESULTS: In vitro temozolomide showed cytotoxicity with a median relative IC50 (rIC50 ) value of 380 microM against the PPTP cell lines (range 1 to > 1,000 microM). The three lines with rIC50 values lesser than 10 microM had low MGMT expression compared to the remaining cell lines. In vivo temozolomide demonstrated significant toxicity at 100 mg/kg, but induced tumor regressions in 15 of 23 evaluable solid tumor models (13 maintained CR [MCR], 2 CR) and 5 of 8 ALL models (3 MCR, 2 CR). There was a steep dose response curve, with lower activity at 66 mg/kg temozolomide and with tumor regressions at 22 and 44 mg/kg restricted to models with low MGMT expression. CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide demonstrated high level antitumor activity against both solid tumor and leukemia models, but also elicited significant toxicity at the highest dose level. Lowering the dose of TMZ to more closely match clinical exposures markedly reduced the antitumor activity for many xenograft lines with responsiveness at lower doses closely related to low MGMT expression.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA. keir0001@mc.duke.edu']",,,,,,,"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4244112,['NIHMS639058'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 18.,"The study objective was to develop a formulation of elacridar to overcome its dissolution-rate-limited bioavailability. Elacridar is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor that has been used to improve the brain distribution of drugs that are substrates of P-gp and BCRP. The chronic use of elacridar is restricted because of the poor solubility leading to poor oral bioavailability. A microemulsion formulation using Cremophor EL, Carbitol, and Captex 355 (6:3:1) was developed. The elacridar microemulsion was effective in the inhibition of P-gp and Bcrp in Madin-Darby canine kidney II-transfected cells. Friend Leukemia Virus Strain B (FVB) mice were used to determine the bioavailability of elacridar after a 10 mg/kg dose of elacridar in the microemulsion, intraperitoneally (i.p.) and orally (p.o.); and the absolute bioavailability was determined to be 1.3 and 0.47, respectively. Coadministration of elacridar microemulsion i.p. with p.o. erlotinib in FVB mice improved the erlotinib brain penetration threefold. The current study shows that a microemulsion formulation of elacridar is effective in improving the bioavailability of elacridar and is an effective inhibitor of P-gp and Bcrp, in vitro and in vivo. It offers an alternative to the suspension and allows a decrease in the dose required to achieve a significant inhibitory effect at the blood-brain barrier.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Brain Barriers Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 CA138437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3967790,['NIHMS555384'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 18.,"BACKGROUND: Statins have antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic effects that have been attributed to inhibition of RHO protein geranylgeranylation in inflammatory cells. The activity of protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I) is widely believed to promote membrane association and activation of RHO family proteins. However, we recently showed that knockout of GGTase-I in macrophages activates RHO proteins and proinflammatory signaling pathways, leading to increased cytokine production and rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we asked whether the increased inflammatory signaling of GGTase-I-deficient macrophages would influence the development of atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic lesions in mice lacking GGTase-I in macrophages (Pggt1btriangle up/triangle up) contained significantly more T lymphocytes than the lesions in controls. Surprisingly, however, mean atherosclerotic lesion area in Pggt1btriangle up/triangle up mice was reduced by approximately 60%. GGTase-I deficiency reduced the accumulation of cholesterol esters and phospholipids in macrophages incubated with minimally modified and acetylated low-density lipoprotein. Analyses of GGTase-I-deficient macrophages revealed upregulation of the cyclooxygenase 2-peroxisome proliferator-activated-gamma pathway and increased scavenger receptor class B type I- and CD36-mediated basal and high-density lipoprotein-stimulated cholesterol efflux. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of RHOA, but not RAC1 or CDC42, normalized cholesterol efflux. The increased cholesterol efflux in cultured cells was accompanied by high levels of macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and slightly reduced plasma lipid levels in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting GGTase-I activates RHOA and leads to increased macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and reduced atherosclerosis development despite a significant increase in inflammation.",,"['Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Medicinaregatan 1G, Box 425, SE-413 90 Gothenburg, Sweden.']",,,,,,,"['HL090553/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG035626-09/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA099506/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL090553/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG035626/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3940160,['NIHMS539904'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the incidence of potential drug interactions (PDIs) in medication prescriptions for children. The study was performed at the University Hospital in Olomouc. PDIs in each patient's prescriptions were identified. Multivariate analysis was performed in order to assess the risk factors confounding the potential interactions. Univariate analysis was used to assess which diagnostic groups and medication groups significantly increase or lower the odds of a potential drug-drug interaction. A total of 6,078 patients meeting the inclusion criteria entered the study. They received 19,522 prescriptions. PDIs were identified in 3.83 % of patients (moderate-to-severe cases in 0.47 %). Patient age (p = 0.008), the average number of prescriptions per visit (p < 0.0001), and the number of visits per year (p < 0.0001) were found to increase the risk of drug interaction. The presence of epilepsy, leukemia, or rheumatoid arthritis and related disease diagnoses were discovered to increase the risk of PDIs significantly. CONCLUSION: The risk of PDIs in children is low, but it increases significantly with age and the number of drugs prescribed, particularly antiepileptics and immunosuppressants. The finding of a potential interaction in 0.47 % of all children in whom any medication was prescribed should not be underestimated since it means a significant risk for one child out of every 200, and it is also substantially higher in the chronically ill. Pediatricians should be aware of relevant interactions and should prevent them by therapeutic drug monitoring or appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring.",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, 77515 Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Dec 28.,"MLL-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (<1 year of age) are frequently resistant to glucocorticoids, like prednisone and dexamethasone. As poor glucocorticoid responses are strongly associated with therapy failure, overcoming glucocorticoid resistance may be a crucial step towards improving prognosis. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid resistance in MLL-rearranged ALL largely remain obscure. We here defined a gene signature that accurately discriminates between prednisolone-resistant and prednisolone-sensitive MLL-rearranged infant ALL patient samples, demonstrating that, among other genes, high-level ANXA2 is associated with prednisolone resistance in this type of leukemia. Further investigation demonstrated that the underlying factor of this association was the presence of Src kinase-induced phosphorylation (activation) of annexin A2, a process requiring the adapter protein p11 (encoded by human S100A10). shRNA-mediated knockdown of either ANXA2, FYN, LCK or S100A10, all led to inhibition of annexin A2 phosphorylation and resulted in marked sensitization to prednisolone. Likewise, exposure of prednisolone-resistant MLL-rearranged ALL cells to different Src kinase inhibitors exerting high specificity towards FYN and/or LCK had similar effects. In conclusion, we here present a novel mechanism of prednisolone resistance in MLL-rearranged leukemias, and propose that inhibition of annexin A2 phosphorylation embodies a therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance to glucocorticoids in this highly aggressive type of leukemia.",,"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Haematology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Dr Molewaterplein 50, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the recently updated US SEER data still show that the majority of older AML patients do not receive any therapy, this reality is slowly changing. Advances in our understanding of the biology of AML and in the field of immunology are facilitating the development of alternative therapeutic options for patients, affording more and novel opportunities for potentially curative treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from multiple cooperative groups show that older patients benefit from the incorporation of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD33 mAb toxin, into induction regimens. The first prospective study for reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in older AML patients was reported at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, 2012; the approach was feasible and improved disease-free survival over conventional chemotherapy. Proof-of-concept trials targeting specific antigens such as WT1 or novel unique leukemia-associated antigens are currently underway, as well as other trials using chimeric antigen receptor T cells or (natural killer/effector cells in nontransplantation settings.

The high performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the best antibody immobilization and antigen capturing efficiency was achieved using fragmented antibodies obtained after reduction of intact antibodies with dithiothreitol. In order to increase efficiency and sensitivity of immunoassay Raman labels consisting of gold nanorods coated by 5-thio-nitrobenzoic acid layer with covalently bounded antibodies have been constructed. The LOD and LOQ of the proposed immunoassay for antigen gp51 detection were found to be 0.95mugmL(-1) and 3.14mugmL(-1), respectively.

Membrane sterol levels, phospholipid (PL) class and subclass proportions and their respective fatty acid (FA) compositions were determined. Morpho-functional parameters were evaluated through total hemocyte count (THC), mortality rate, phagocytosis ability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Both morpho-functional parameters and lipid composition were profoundly affected in neoplastic cells. These dedifferentiated cells displayed higher THC (5x), mortality rate (3x) and ROS production with addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenylhydrazone (1.7x) but lower phagocytosis ability ((1/2)x), than unaffected hemocytes. Total PL amounts were higher in neoplastic cells than in hemocytes (12.3 and 5.1 nmolx10(-6) cells, respectively). However, sterols and a particular subclass of PL (plasmalogens; 1-alkenyl-2-acyl PL) were present in similar amounts in both cell type membranes. This led to a two times lower proportion of these membrane lipid constituents in neoplastic cells when compared to hemocytes (20.5% vs. 42.1% of sterols in total membrane lipids and 21.7% vs. 44.2% of plasmalogens among total PL, respectively). Proportions of non-methylene interrupted FA- and 20:1n-11-plasmalogen molecular species were the most impacted in neoplastic cells when compared to hemocytes ((1/3)x and (1/4)x, respectively).

The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of 3-methoxyapigenin (3-MA) with beta-catenin/LEF reporter system. The anti-cancer mechanisms in Jurkat leukemic cells were also examined. MAIN METHODS: HEK 293-TOP/FOP reporter cells were used to determine the inhibitory effect of 3-MA on Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. We also used Jurkat-TOP reporter cells to confirm the inhibitory effect and the action mechanisms of 3-MA. Target genes and cell proliferation were analyzed by RT-PCR and (3)H-thymidine uptake assay. The effects of 3-MA on beta-catenin phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting and by in vitro kinase assays. beta-catenin translocation and its transactivation were verified by cellular fractionation and EMSA. KEY FINDINGS: 3-MA inhibited Wnt-3A-induced luciferase activity in the HEK 293-TOP/FOP reporter system. Western blotting analysis showed that phosphorylation sites in beta-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) were inhibited by 3-MA in Jurkat. In parallel, in vitro kinase assays verified this effect. As a result, total beta-catenin turnover remained balanced by this dual inhibitory effect of 3-MA. Although the beta-catenin protein level remained unchanged, 3-MA did inhibit beta-catenin translocation. Finally, we found that the beta-catenin/LEF transcriptional activity, expression of c-myc and cyclin-D3, and cell proliferation were inhibited by 3-MA. SIGNIFICANCE: 3-MA modulates the turnover of beta-catenin and suppresses the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through inhibition of beta-catenin translocation. We suggested that 3-MA has potential as an anti-cancer drug.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom in all phases of the cancer trajectory. Chronic fatigue (CF) is defined as fatigue with duration 6months. The etiology of CF in cancer survivors is poorly understood, but a link to inflammatory activity has been suggested. In the present study we explored the relation between CF and the levels of 17 cytokines among a national representative sample of 232 adult survivors after childhood lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Chalder's fatigue questionnaire assessed CF. The sera of the survivors were analyzed for 27 cytokines, where of 17 were detectable. RESULTS: Median age at survey and diagnosis was 29.7years (range 18.6-54.5years) and 9.6years (range 0.3-18.0years), respectively. Median follow-up time was 21.5years (range 7.1-40.0years). CF was not associated with increased levels of any of the 17 detectable cytokines when all three diagnostic groups were included in the analyses. In sub-analyses of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors only, those with CF had significant higher levels of IL-9, FGF, PDGF and eotaxin compared to those without CF (p<0.05). Gender, age, diagnosis, obesity, or reduced heart function did not impact upon the results. Differences in cytokine levels between the diagnostic groups were observed irrespective of the presence/absence of CF. CONCLUSION: This study could not confirm a relation between levels of cytokines and CF in adults who survived childhood lymphoma and ALL, except for among NHL survivors. Despite the broad spectrum of cytokines and relatively large sample, small aberrances may not have been traced.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The introduction of more sensitive techniques, such as RT quantitative (Q)-PCR, may lead to an overestimation of the risk of CML relapse. In this study, we reviewed the results of peripheral blood RT Q-PCR in CML patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT from 1983 to 2007. In our laboratory, RT Q-PCR analysis was routinely performed since 2002. Eighty-seven of 189 patients had available RT Q-PCR data; 63 patients had at least 3 RT Q-PCR analyses assessable. Fifty-two of 63 patients (83%) had, at least once, detectable transcript levels, but with an BCR-ABL/ABL ratio <.1% defined as <MR3 (molecular remission <0,1%), whereas 11 (17%) had persistent undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts. Six of 52 patients with <MR3 relapsed, defined as BCR-ABL transcript numbers >.1% confirmed by the finding of Ph+ cells in bone marrow. No patients with persistent undetectable transcripts relapsed (P = .19). Relapse did not correlate with the number of occurrences of <MR3 or with the time to the first <MR3 result. Finally, of 46 patients with detectable transcripts who did not relapse, 35 had undetectable transcripts at last contact. RT Q-PCR analysis had low specificity (19%) and low positive predictive value (12%) in predicting relapse of CML patients after allogeneic HSCT. Our data suggest that detection of low BCR-ABL transcript levels by RT Q-PCR analysis has a poor accuracy in defining the risk of CML relapse and should not be considered as the unique indication to treatment. Fluctuation of BCR-ABL transcripts levels is common as late as >/=10 years posttransplantation, possibly suggesting the long-term persistence of CML stem cells.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the influence of Am80 on anti-anxiety-like behavior, which is a characteristic of age-associated emotional disorder, in the P8 strain of senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8). Am80 at a concentration of 2 mg/kg/day was administered to the mice in their feed for 1.5 months. In open-field and hole-board tests, the number of ambulation, rearing, and head dipping actions, as well as the distance moved were significantly decreased in Am80-treated SAMP8 compared with untreated SAMP8. In the light/dark box test, the latencies for the first exit were significantly increased in the Am80-treated SAMP8 compared with the untreated SAMP8. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the area of serotonin transporter-positive immunoreactivity in the coronal sections of the forebrain of the Am80-treated SAMP8 was increased compared with the untreated SAMP8. Furthermore, the metabolic turnovers of serotonin and dopamine were increased in the amygdalae of the SAMP8 by Am80 treatment. Thus, in the present study, Am80 was found to improve exploratory and emotional behavior in SAMP8, suggesting that Am80 regulates monoamines directly or indirectly in this senescence-accelerated model.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Genomic activity of the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) mediates most vitamin D3's actions and many gene targets of 1,25D have been characterized. As the importance of non-coding RNAs has emerged, the ability of vitamin D3via 1,25D to regulate microRNAs (miRNAs) has been demonstrated in several cancer cell lines, patient tissue and sera. In vitamin D3 intervention patient trials, significant differences in miRNAs are observed between treatment groups and/or between baseline and followup. In patient sera from population studies, specific miRNA differences associate with serum levels of 25D. The findings thus far indicate that dietary vitamin D3 in patients and 1,25D in vitro not only regulate specific miRNA(s), but may also globally upregulate miRNA levels.

Cumulative infection-related mortality was significantly higher in ATL patients than in the 2 other groups (ATL versus AML, P = .0496; ATL versus ALL/LBL, P = .0075), and most death-causing pathogens were bacteria and fungus. The appearance of CMV infection was negatively associated with infectious mortality in ATL patients, but the P value for this association was near the borderline of significance (P = .0569). In multivariate analysis, transplantation using unrelated bone marrow and episodes of CMV infection were associated with worse overall survival in ATL patients, but were not in either AML or ALL/LBL patients. Collectively, the impact of infectious complications after transplantation in ATL patients was different from that in AML and ALL/LBL patients, suggesting that a more intensive strategy for infection control in ATL patients is required to reduce infectious mortality.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited recessive disease caused by mutations in one of fifteen genes known to encode FA pathway components. In response to DNA damage, nuclear FA proteins associate into high molecular weight complexes through a cascade of post-translational modifications and physical interactions, followed by the repair of damaged DNA. Hematopoietic cells are particularly sensitive to the loss of these interactions, and bone marrow failure occurs almost universally in FA patients. FA as a disease is further characterized by cancer susceptibility, which highlights the importance of the FA pathway in tumor suppression, and will be the focus of this review. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common cancer type, often subsequent to bone marrow failure. However, FA patients are also at an extreme risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck and gynecological tract, with an even greater incidence in those individuals who have received a bone marrow transplant and recovered from hematopoietic disease. FA tumor suppression in hematopoietic versus epithelial compartments could be mechanistically similar or distinct. Definition of compartment specific FA activities is now critical to assess the effects of today's bone marrow failure treatments on tomorrow's solid tumor development. It is our hope that current therapies can then be optimized to decrease the risk of malignant transformation in both hematopoietic and epithelial cells. Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of the Fanconi anemia pathway as it contributes to stress responses, DNA repair and squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations for the plasma membranes of normal murine thymocytes and thymus-derived leukemic GRSL cells in water have been performed under physiological isothermal-isobaric conditions (310.15K and 1 atm) to investigate changes in membrane properties induced by canceration. The model membranes used in our calculations for normal and leukemic thymocytes comprised 23 and 25 kinds of lipids, respectively, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol. The mole fractions of the lipids adopted here were based on previously published experimental values. Our calculations clearly showed that the membrane area was increased in leukemic cells, and that the isothermal area compressibility of the leukemic plasma membranes was double that of normal cells. The calculated membranes of leukemic cells were thus considerably bulkier and softer in the lateral direction compared with those of normal cells. The tilt angle of the cholesterol and the conformation of the phospholipid fatty acid tails both showed a lower level of order in leukemic cell membranes compared with normal cell membranes. The lateral radial distribution function of the lipids also showed a more disordered structure in leukemic cell membranes than in normal cell membranes. These observations all show that, for the present thymocytes, the lateral structure of the membrane is considerably disordered by canceration. Furthermore, the calculated lateral self-diffusion coefficient of the lipid molecules in leukemic cell membranes was almost double that in normal cell membranes. The calculated rotational and wobbling autocorrelation functions also indicated that the molecular motion of the lipids was enhanced in leukemic cell membranes. Thus, here we have demonstrated that the membranes of thymocyte leukemic cells are more disordered and more fluid than normal cell membranes.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To elucidate splice-isoform regulators of human BC LSC maintenance, we performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, splice-isoform-specific quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), nanoproteomics, stromal coculture, and BC LSC xenotransplantation analyses. Cumulatively, these studies show that the alternative splicing of multiple prosurvival BCL2 family genes promotes malignant transformation of myeloid progenitors into BC LSCS that are quiescent in the marrow niche and that contribute to therapeutic resistance. Notably, sabutoclax, a pan-BCL2 inhibitor, renders marrow-niche-resident BC LSCs sensitive to TKIs at doses that spare normal progenitors. These findings underscore the importance of alternative BCL2 family splice-isoform expression in BC LSC maintenance and suggest that the combinatorial inhibition of prosurvival BCL2 family proteins and BCR-ABL may eliminate dormant LSCs and obviate resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent studies have shown that relative redox levels in primary tumors can be heterogeneous, suggesting that regimens dependent on differential oxidative state may not be uniformly effective. To investigate this issue in hematological malignancies, we evaluated mechanisms controlling oxidative state in primary specimens derived from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Our studies demonstrate three striking findings. First, the majority of functionally defined leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are characterized by relatively low levels of reactive oxygen species (termed ""ROS-low""). Second, ROS-low LSCs aberrantly overexpress BCL-2. Third, BCL-2 inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and selectively eradicated quiescent LSCs. Based on these findings, we propose a model wherein the unique physiology of ROS-low LSCs provides an opportunity for selective targeting via disruption of BCL-2-dependent oxidative phosphorylation.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the distribution of bone marrow findings in such cases of new-onset pancytopenia in a tertiary academic medical center, we evaluated 250 recent bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed in the setting of new-onset pancytopenia in patients without previously diagnosed hematologic neoplastic disease. Of the 250 bone marrow studies, 193 were performed in adults and 57 were performed in children. In children, the most prevalent bone marrow finding was B-lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by nonspecific changes attributed clinically to a variety of factors including multifactorial, autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious etiologies. In adults, hematologic neoplastic causes of pancytopenia were the most prevalent diagnoses, with the cases divided mostly between acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, with fewer numbers of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and lymphomas. Many bone marrow findings demonstrated nonspecific changes that were attributed clinically to a variety of etiologies such as myelodysplastic syndrome, multifactorial causes, hypersplenism, drugs, and systemic disease. Overall, in both the pediatric and the adult population, new-onset pancytopenia was most commonly associated with neoplasia, although the neoplasm differed by age group. Although in most cases, a definitive diagnosis could be made based solely on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy interpretation, a significant fraction of cases in both children and adults demonstrated nonspecific marrow findings that required clinical follow-up and/or repeat biopsy for definitive diagnosis.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"To determine the association between infection with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and cow longevity, a stratified random sample of 3,849 Holsteins in 112 Michigan dairy herds was followed for an average of 597 d following testing for BLV antibodies with an ELISA milk test. The hazard ratio of 1.23 indicates that BLV-positive cows were 23% more likely than their BLV-negative herd mates to die or be culled during the monitoring period. This result is adjusted for lactation number, which is also positively associated with an increased risk of leaving the herd. Because herd was included in models, the effect of BLV ELISA on cow longevity was a within-herd comparison in which BLV-infected cattle were compared with their uninfected herd mates. The analysis of 4 ELISA optical density (OD) groups demonstrated a dose response such that cows with higher OD values had decreased survival compared with cows with lower OD values. Cows with OD values above 0.5 were at 40% greater risk of dying or being culled than were their uninfected herd mates. These results support the contention that the association of BLV with cow longevity, when added to other economic impacts, may warrant the control of BLV in our US dairy cow population.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

PATIENT(S): A total of 465 families whose sons were already treated for cancer. INTERVENTION(S): The questionnaire was designed for two groups based on child's age at the time of cancer diagnosis: <12 and >/=12 years old. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Descriptive statistics regarding a positive or negative attitude of parents toward fertility preservation options in the context of different risk levels of infertility and success rates of fertility restoration. RESULT(S): The response rate was 78%. Sixty-four percent of parents of boys >/=12 years old would agree to store sperm obtained by masturbation and/or electroejaculation, and 54% of parents of boys <12 years old would agree to store a testicular biopsy. If the risk of infertility or the success rate of fertility restoration were </=20%, more than one-fourth of parents would still opt for fertility preservation. CONCLUSION(S): All parents should be counseled about the risks of infertility due to cancer treatment, because many parents want to preserve their son's fertility even if the risk of becoming infertile or the chances on fertility restoration are low.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Epub 2013 Feb 6.,"Human Apo2-ligand/TRAIL is a member of the TNF cytokine superfamily capable of inducing apoptosis on tumor cells while sparing normal cells. Besides its antitumor activity, Apo2L/TRAIL is also implicated in immune regulation. Apo2L/TRAIL is stored inside activated T cells in cytoplasmic multivesicular bodies and is physiologically released to the extracellular medium inserted in the internal membrane vesicles, known as exosomes. In this study we have generated artificial lipid vesicles coated with bioactive Apo2L/TRAIL, which resemble natural exosomes, to analyze their apoptosis-inducing ability on cell lines from hematological tumors. We have tethered Apo2L/TRAIL to lipid vesicles by using a novel Ni(2+)-(N-5-amino-1-carboxylpentyl)-iminodiacetic acid, NTA)-containing liposomal system. This lipidic framework (LUVs-Apo2L/TRAIL) greatly improves Apo2L/TRAIL activity, decreasing by around 14-fold the LC50 on the T-cell leukemia Jurkat. This increase in bioactivity correlated with the greater ability of LUVs-Apo2L/TRAIL to induce caspase-3 activation and is probably due to the increase in local concentration of Apo2L/TRAIL, improving its receptor cross-linking efficiency. More important, liposome-bound Apo2L/TRAIL overcame the resistance to soluble recombinant Apo2L/TRAIL exhibited by tumor cell mutants overexpressing Bcl-xL or by a Bax and Bak-defective Jurkat cell mutant (Jurkat-shBak) and are also effective against other hematologic tumor cells. Jurkat-Bcl-xL and Jurkat-shBak cells are resistant to most chemotherapeutic drugs currently used in cancer treatment, and their sensitivity to LUVs-Apo2L/TRAIL could have potential clinical applications.",,"['Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 18.,"Ectopic extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), defined as the formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow, usually occurs in a scenario of chronic anemia when, even after conversion of the bony yellow marrow to red marrow, the body is still unable to meet the demand for red blood cells. Ectopic extramedullary hematopoiesis most commonly occurs in the liver and spleen but may, in fact, occur almost anywhere in the body. Although previous reports have documented EMH presenting as paraspinal masses, such lesions have almost always been associated with a predisposing hematological disorder such as hemolytic anemia, myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndromes, thalassemia, polycythemia vera, leukemia, or lymphoma. The authors of this report describe the first reported instance of EMH in a patient presenting with a symptomatic epidural and paraspinal cervical lesion arising from the posterior spinal elements and no known predisposing hematological disease. Initial radiographs revealed a bony lesion arising posteriorly from the C2-3 laminae and spinous processes. Subsequent imaging suggested the diagnosis, which was confirmed by CT-guided biopsy, peripheral blood smears, and bone marrow aspirate. Despite epidural compression and slight displacement of the cervical cord and thecal sac, the patient's symptoms were limited to pain and diminished cervical range of motion. Therefore, surgery was deferred in favor of nonsurgical therapy. Several alternative modalities for the treatment of EMH have been suggested in the literature, including cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy. The authors opted for an approach utilizing directed low-dose radiotherapy of a total of 25 Gy divided in 2.5-Gy fractions. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient continued to be asymptomatic, and MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in the dimensions of the lesion. Extramedullary hematopoiesis with spinal cord compression in the absence of a preexisting hematological disorder has not been described in the context of clinical neurosurgical practice. Recognizing that EMH may present as an epidural or paraspinal lesion is important since chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective therapeutic options in the majority of patients who suffer few if any symptoms. Extensive evaluation for underlying hematological disorders is necessary before undertaking directed therapy. Inadvertent resection of these highly vascularized masses may risk catastrophic intraoperative hemorrhage with no proven benefit as compared with medical treatment, which usually provides excellent long-term outcomes.",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria, IL 61637, USA. tobias.a.mattei@osfhealthcare.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry is therefore paramount to ensuring accurate diagnostic distinction between these tumors. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the expression of PAX5 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), in Merkel cell carcinoma and pulmonary small cell carcinoma. DESIGN: PAX5 and TdT immunohistochemical stains were performed on 27 Merkel cell carcinomas and 10 pulmonary small cell carcinomas. RESULTS: PAX5 was expressed in 24/27 (89%) Merkel cell carcinomas and 0/10 (0%) pulmonary small cell carcinomas. TdT was expressed in 21/27 (78%) Merkel cell carcinomas and 9/10 (90%) pulmonary small cell carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that PAX5 and TdT expression can be expressed in a high percentage of Merkel cell carcinomas and so when positive are not diagnostic of lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. When dealing with metastatic lesions, PAX5 negativity would favor a diagnosis of pulmonary small cell carcinoma over Merkel cell carcinoma. In addition, TTF-1 negative pulmonary small cell carcinoma is to be differentiated from Merkel cell carcinoma.",,"['Department of Pathology, Georgia Health Sciences University Augusta, GA, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Merkel cell carcinoma', 'PAX5', 'TdT', 'lung', 'small cell carcinoma']",,PMC3544244,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Mar 25.,"Acute leukemia is the most common malignancy in childhood, which mainly involves children less than 15 years of age. The growing skeleton is the main site of involvement in children. Leukemic cells proliferate within the massive red bone marrow in children. So besides the pallor, petechia, purpura and ecchymosis in the skin and mucosal surfaces, bone pain and other bony lesions are other manifestations of leukemia.On the other hand, bony lesions are more prevalent in children than adults with no poor prognosis in comparison to patients without bone lesions. These bony lesions may precede other laboratory tests so familiarity with these presentations is very important for earlier diagnosis.In this pictorial essay, we tried to gather the most common bony lesions that may be seen in acute leukemia in different cases admitted to our hospital with general malaise and localized tenderness and discomfort leading us to perform plain X-ray for further evaluation. Finding these bony lesions helps clinicians to reach the diagnosis quickly. These findings include metaphyseal lucent band and erosion, periosteal reaction, small lucent bone lesion and permeative appearance, reduced bone density and collapsed vertebra.",,"['Department of Radiology, Loghman-e Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Leukemia', 'Radiography']",,PMC3522339,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 17.,"The European Pediatric Medicine Regulation was launched in 2007 to provide better medicines for children. Five years later, the number of new anticancer drugs in early development in the pediatric population remains low, and most children with cancer are still largely denied access to innovative drugs in Europe, as compared with the United States. We analyzed individual pediatric investigation plan (PIP) and waiver decisions for oncology drugs and all oncology drugs that have been approved for marketing authorization since 2007 in Europe. Among the 45 approved PIPs, 33% concern leukemias and lymphomas, 29% solid tumors, 13% brain tumors, and 20% a drug for supportive care. No specific PIP exists for life-threatening diseases such as high-risk neuroblastoma, whereas there are several PIPs in extremely rare malignancies in children and adolescents such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, melanoma, thyroid cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia. This paradoxical situation is due to approval of a PIP being driven by the adult indication. Twenty-six of 28 authorized new oncology drugs have a potentially relevant mechanism of action for pediatric malignancies, but 50% have been waived because the adult condition does not occur in children. The most striking example is crizotinib.

Molecular cytogenetics has greatly improved diagnostic capability of classical cytogenetics analysis of metaphase-based chromosome for the identification of genetic aberrations. The availability of a large number of fluorescent probes, each specific for different genetic lesions, together with a robust protocol for interphase FISH, provide the pathologist with the essential tools for an accurate evaluation of patient's disease. Hemato-oncological and many of the solid tumors have been comprehensively characterized by peculiar genetic defects and are now routinely evaluated by interphase FISH. Despite the reliability of the method, which has undergone only minor changes since the 1970s, FISH assay is still hampered by reagents cost, preventing its adoption in large-scale oncological screening. In this chapter we describe a major improvement of interphase FISH assay for cytological samples through the description of the miniaturized device microFIND((R)) that offers, besides reduction of cost per assay, a completely novel vision to the FISH technology, thanks to the perspective of full automation of FISH assay using a dedicated robotic platform for microFIND((R)) handling, (not presently described in the chapter).",,"['Tethis SPA, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LSC burden correlated with leukocyte count, spleen size, hemoglobin and blast percentage. A low initial LSC percentage was associated with less therapy-related hematological toxicity and superior cytogenetic and molecular responses. After initiation of TKI therapy, the LPCs and LSCs rapidly decreased in both therapy groups, but at 3 months time point the median LPC level was significantly lower in dasatinib group compared with imatinib patients (0.05% vs 0.68%, P=0.032).

Epub 2013 Jan 12.,"t(8;22)(p11;q11) is a rare but recurrent chromosome translocation that has been reported in 11 cases of myeloproliferative neoplasm or B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This translocation results in an in-frame fusion of FGFR1 on 8p11 and BCR on 22q11, and causes constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase of the BCR/FGFR1 chimera protein. Here, we report the twelfth case of hematological tumor bearing t(8;22)(p11;q11). The bone marrow showed hypoplastic and tri-lineage dysplasia with 24.4% abnormal cells. The abnormal cells were not defined as myeloid or lymphoid morphologically, lacking a myeloperoxidase reaction. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed that the abnormal cells expressed CD13, CD33, CD34, and CD19, and that a fraction of the abnormal cells was positive for CD10. Southern blot analysis of the bone marrow cells showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, a genetic hallmark of B-cell differentiation. Previously reported cases with t(8;22)(p11;q11) suggested an association between myeloid and B-lymphoid tumors, whereas other chromosome translocations involving FGFR1 on 8p11 showed a link between myeloid and T-lymphoid tumors. Our observation supports that t(8;22)(p11;q11) might define a dual myeloid and B-lymphoid disorder.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Epub 2013 Jan 11.,"INTRODUCTION: The etiopathogenesis of childhood leukemia is not fully understood. It is suggested that endogenous viral sequences may play a role in leukemogenesis. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) constitute about 8% of the human genome. Most HERVs are dysfunctional because of numerous mutations and deletions. Some HERVs, however, contain sequences capable of transcription. In patients with leukemia, the presence of antibodies against HERV-K has been identified, which could suggest increased expression of HERV-K in leukemic cells. To elucidate the role of endogenous retroviruses in leukemogenesis, studies were undertaken to assess env gene expression of HERV-K and HERV-W in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: This study was performed in 170 children with ALL, 38 subjects with AML, and 30 healthy subjects. Expression of the env gene of HERV-K and HERV-W and the control gene ACTB was studied by real-time PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers and SYBR Green marker. Env gene expression was assessed on the basis of the absolute threshold-Ct, as well as normalized against ACTB expression and double normalized expression relative to ACTB and reference cells - normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Env gene expression of HERV-K normalized against ACTB, as well as double normalized expression relative to ACTB and normal PBL, was significantly higher only in AML. There were no statistically significant differences in env gene expression of HERV-W normalized to ACTB in ALL and AML as compared to normal PBL. CONCLUSION: High normalized expression of the env gene of HERV-K in AML strongly suggests a possible contribution of this gene in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is an abundant nucleolar protein implicated in ribosome maturation and export, centrosome duplication and response to stress stimuli. NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia. Mutations at the C-terminal domain led to variant proteins that aberrantly and stably translocate to the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that NPM1 C-terminal domain binds with high affinity G-quadruplex DNA. Here, we investigate the structural determinants of NPM1 nucleolar localization. We show that NPM1 interacts with several G-quadruplex regions found in ribosomal DNA, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the most common leukemic NPM1 variant completely loses this activity. This is the consequence of G-quadruplex-binding domain destabilization, as mutations aimed at refolding the leukemic variant also result in rescuing the G-quadruplex-binding activity and nucleolar localization. Finally, we show that treatment of cells with a G-quadruplex selective ligand results in wild-type NPM1 dislocation from nucleoli into nucleoplasm. In conclusion, this work establishes a direct correlation between NPM1 G-quadruplex binding at rDNA and its nucleolar localization, which is impaired in the acute myeloid leukemia-associated protein variants.",,"[""Department of Biochemical Sciences, 'Sapienza' University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3597674,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: There were 4 males and 1 female with a median age on a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at 47 (44 - 68) years. The median duration from a diagnosis of CLL to transformation was 52 (5 - 90) months. As for cytogenetic abnormalities, 3/4 patients had 17p deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The clinical manifestations on transformation included regional enlargement of lymph node (n = 2) and systemic enlargement of lymph nodes (n = 3). All diagnoses were confirmed by lymph node biopsy and all transformed into diffuse large B cell lymphoma (classical transformation). The subgroups were germinal center B-cell like (GCB) (n = 3) and non-GCB (n = 1). After transformation, one patient underwent sibling allo-stem cell transplantation and survived 24 months until April 2012. Another patient with auto-stem cell transplantation relapsed and died 12 months later. One patient lost the treatment opportunity due to worsening condition. Another 2 patients gained partial remission after therapy and survived 20 and 8 months respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Richter syndrome may occur during a late stage of CLL.

The median follow-up period was 27 (1 - 142) months. There was no follow-up loss. Eleven cases progressed and 6 died. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached. And the 1, 3, 6-year OS rates were 84%, 78% and 58% respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was (63 +/- 24) months and the 1, 2, 5-year PFS rates were 86%, 72% and 44% respectively. The median PFS of HCL-V was significant shorter than HCL-C ((23 +/- 3) vs (78 +/- 12) months, P = 0.014). In HCL-C group, fever (P = 0.038) and anemia (P = 0.000) at diagnosis were poor prognostic factors. But purine nucleoside analogues made no significant difference in PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Pancytopenia is infrequent in Chinese HCL patients. And classical RLC is rare under electron microscope. Purine nucleoside analogues may achieve a better CR rate, but fail to improve PFS rate. As compared with HCL-C, HCL-V is common with genetic abnormalities and has a worse prognosis with a shorter PFS.",,"['Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 18.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess cancer risk in congenital heart defect patients, with and without Down's syndrome, compared with the general population. METHODS: We identified all patients born and diagnosed with congenital heart defects from 1977 to 2008 using the Danish National Registry of Patients, covering all Danish hospitals. We compared cancer incidence in the congenital heart defect cohort with that expected in the general population ( approximately 5.5 million) using the Danish Cancer Registry, and computed age- and gender-standardised incidence ratios. RESULTS: We identified 15,905 congenital heart defect patients, contributing a total of 151,172 person-years at risk; the maximum length of follow-up was 31 years (median 8 years). In all, 53 patients were diagnosed with cancer, including 30 female and 23 male patients (standardised incidence ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-2.13). Risks were increased for leukaemia, brain tumours, and basal cell carcinoma. After excluding 801 patients with Down's syndrome, the standardised incidence ratio was 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.64). In the subgroup of 5660 non-Down's syndrome patients undergoing cardiac surgery or catheter-based interventions, the standardised incidence ratio was 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.86-2.29). CONCLUSION: The overall risk of cancer among congenital heart defect patients without Down's syndrome was not statistically significantly elevated. Cancer risk in the congenital heart defect cohort as a whole, including patients with Down's syndrome, was increased compared with the general population, although the absolute risk was low. Studies with longer follow-up and more information on radiation doses are needed to further examine a potential cancer risk associated with diagnostic radiation exposure.",,"['1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '2 Department of Paediatrics, Hospital Lillebaelt, Kolding, Denmark.', '1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '3 Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Heart Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '4 Department of Cardiology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', '5 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Rigshospitalet - Copenhagen University Hospital, Heart Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '6 Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', '1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measuring blast count by morphology alone has been the standard hematopathologic technique. Although helpful to guide future treatment decisions, the early bone marrow does not predict well which patients will achieve complete remission, and ultimately be cured. New methods of assessing early treatment effectiveness are being developed. This review summarizes the current utility of early bone marrow evaluations and looks toward future developments. RECENT FINDINGS: More sensitive techniques than light microscopy are available to analyze the presence or absence of leukemia after treatment. These include flow-cytometry and polymerase chain reaction-based assays, and their use is playing a larger role in monitoring therapy effectiveness after induction and during consolidation. Importantly, novel techniques including enzymatic amplification staining (performed on bone marrow samples) and noninvasive molecular imaging have been studied and may play a role in future therapy asessment.

Conventional AML treatment includes induction chemotherapy to achieve disease control, followed by consolidation therapy with conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic/autologous stem cell transplantation (allo/auto-SCT) to eradicate residual disease. Even younger patients receiving the most intensive treatment have a median, long-term, AML-free survival of only 45-50%, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. The important role of the bone marrow cytokine network during disease development and treatment is suggested by several observations, including: (i) the increased microvascular density (MVD) in leukemic bone marrow, (ii) experimental evidence of cytokine-mediated crosstalk between leukemic and microvascular endothelial cells, (iii) the prognostic impact of angioregulatory cytokine levels both in patients receiving conventional chemotherapy and allo-SCT, and (iv) the experimental evidence for an antileukemic effect of cytokine inhibition in human AML. Several cytokines are constitutively released by human AML cells, including interleukins, chemokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and angiopoietins. However, the cytokine system constitutes a functional, interacting network, and recent evidence suggests that analysis of serum cytokine profiles rather than the analysis of single cytokines should be used for prognostic evaluation of AML patients. We will discuss the role of angioregulatory cytokines in leukemogenesis, including their direct effects on the leukemic cells, as well as their indirect contribution to leukemogenesis through angioregulation and crosstalk between leukemic and neighboring stromal cells. We shall also discuss the possibility of targeting angioregulatory cytokines as a part of the treatment strategy in leukemia.",,"['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'angiogenesis', 'bone marrow', 'cytokines', 'stem cell transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of airway stenting in chemoradiotherapy naive patients with severe airway stenosis due to malignant lymphoma. METHODS: Patients who underwent airway stent placement from April 2007 to July 2011 in a single center were retrospectively reviewed. All stenting procedures were performed using rigid and flexible bronchoscopes under general anesthesia. RESULTS: We performed 174 airway stenting procedures (silicone stents in 154 procedures and metallic in 20 procedures) for 150 patients during the study period. Of the patients, 7 had untreated malignant lymphomas (4 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 2 lymphoblastic lymphomas, 1 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma). All patients underwent stenting using the silicone Y-stent (6 on the main carina and 1 on the primary right carina). Dyspnea was relieved immediately in 6 of 7 patients including the mechanically ventilated patient. Stents could be removed in all patients (median 90 d after stenting; range, 32 to 245 d) because of the tumor response to tumor-specific therapy. One granuloma formation and 1 mucus retention triggered the decision to remove the stents. CONCLUSIONS: Airway stenting using silicone stents is safe and effective in palliation of airway stenosis in patients with untreated malignant lymphoma, and permits postprocedural tumor-specific therapy.

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"DNA hypermethylation resulting in aberrant epigenetic silencing plays an important role in the oncogenesis of many cancer types, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).(4) The modulation of NK cell receptors and their cognate ligands is a known mechanism of immune escape in AML, and some membrane proteins, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), are known to be transcriptionally regulated by DNA methylation of their promoter regions. Thus, restoring proper expression of immunoreceptors or their ligands with immunosensitizing drugs is an attractive approach to improving cancer immunotherapy. The cytidine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine, DAC) has both a hypomethylating effect at low doses when incorporated into DNA and a cytotoxic effect at higher doses as a result of interfering with translation when incorporated into RNA. Thus, decitabine has been used at higher doses for its direct anti-leukemic effect, and is being tested at low doses for its ability to correct the malignant gene expression phenotype. A known benefit of hypomethylating agents is their ability to sensitize AML blasts to lysis by NK cells. However, there is little information on the direct effect of hypomethylating agents on NK cell phenotype, proliferation, survival, or function. We recently described a method for inducing robust proliferation of NK cells, enabling us to study the hypomethylating effects of decitabine. To distinguish direct toxicity of the decitabine from its hypomethylating effect, and promote hypomethylation during proliferation, decitabine was added to human peripheral blood NK cells at concentrations from 0.02 to 5muM under either static or proliferation-inducing culture conditions. After 5 days, NK cells were assessed for viability, proliferation, cytotoxicity, expression of major activating and inhibitory receptors, and global DNA methylation. Increasing concentrations of decitabine not only causes increased expression of KIR and the activating receptor NKp44, but also causes decreased viability, proliferation, and expression of the activating receptor NKG2D. Decitabine treatment results in a biphasic effect in overall NK cell lytic function, which correlates with a biphasic pattern of global hypomethylation. Decitabine affects the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in NK cells at low concentrations when exposed during cell proliferation. High doses of decitabine decrease NK cell proliferation and viability, likely through direct inhibition of mRNA transcription. The results of these combined effects leads to a biphasic response in hypomethylation and cytotoxicity.

Genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed, including the clustering of ring sideroblasts with SF3B1 mutations in MDS. Spliceosome mutations might result in defective small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes assembly on the pre-mRNA, deregulated global and alternative mRNA splicing, nuclear-cytoplasm export, and unpliced mRNA degradation, and thus may alter the expression of multiple genes.

These programs operate in normal hematopoiesis where they are involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation and maintenance. Ets Related Gene (ERG) is a component of normal and leukemic stem cell signatures and high ERG expression is a risk factor for poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, mechanisms that underlie ERG expression in AML and how its expression relates to leukemic stemness are unknown. We report that ERG expression in AML is associated with activity of the ERG promoters and +85 stem cell enhancer and a heptad of transcription factors that combinatorially regulate genes in HSCs. Gene expression signatures derived from ERG promoter-stem cell enhancer and heptad activity are associated with clinical outcome when ERG expression alone fails. We also show that the heptad signature is associated with AMLs that lack somatic mutations in NPM1 and confers an adverse prognosis when associated with FLT3 mutations. Taken together, these results suggest that transcriptional regulators cooperate to establish or maintain primitive stem cell-like signatures in leukemic cells and that the underlying pattern of somatic mutations contributes to the development of these signatures and modulate their influence on clinical outcome.",,"['Lowy Cancer Research Centre and the Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",,,,['Blood. 2014 May 1;123(18):2901'],,,"['079249/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of', 'Animals in Research/United Kingdom', '12765/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '095663/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100140/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EBV status in children with various malignant diseases after they completed their treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive children with various malignant diseases previously received treatment at the University of Tsukuba Hospital. Nine cases had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 10 had solid tumors, 4 had lymphoma, 4 had CNS tumors, and 3 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EBV DNA in 328 whole blood samples were monitored by real-time QPCR for all cases after treatment. Clinical records and laboratory data were also reviewed. RESULTS: There were 6/30 (20%) cases with continuous detection of EBV DNA while there were 24/30 (80%) cases without continuous EBV DNA. EBV DNAemia was persistently observed in 4/9 (44.4%) cases with ALL and in 2/4 (50%) cases with lymphoma. Persistent EBV DNAemia can be observed for >5 years without any EBV associated symptoms or diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors have persistent EBV DNAemia more frequently, which is thought to be observed in cases with ALL and lymphoma with higher tendency for >5 years after treatment. Persistent EBV DNAemia is frequent in CCSs aged 5-10 years. Any immunological alteration is speculative in a pathophysiology of persistent EBV DNAemia.",,"['Department of Pediatric Health, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. shazamahmoud08@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The toxic effect of selenite on leukemic HL60 cells was performed with cell counting kit 8. Selenite effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction were determined by flow cytometry. The contents of cyclin B1, Mcl-1, AIF, cytochrome C, insoluble and soluble tubulins were detected with western blotting. Microtubules were visualized with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The interaction between CDK1 and Mcl-1 was assessed with immunoprecipitation. Decreasing Mcl-1 and cyclin B1 expression were carried out through siRNA interference. The alterations of Mcl-1 and cyclin B1 in animal model were detected with either immunohistochemical staining or western blotting. In situ detection of apoptotic ratio was performed with TUNEL assay. RESULTS: Our current results showed that selenite inhibited the growth of HL60 cells and induced mitochondrial-related apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that microtubule assembly in HL60 cells was altered, those cells were arrested at G2/M phase, and Cyclin B1 was up-regulated and interacted with CDK1, which led to down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Finally, in vivo experiments confirmed the in vitro microtubule disruption effect and alterations in Cyclin B1 and Mcl-1 levels by selenite. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results from our study indicate that microtubules are novel targets of selenite in leukemic HL60 cells.",,"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, CAMS & PUMC, Beijing 100005, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3561191,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: The retrospective study covered the 13 years from 1997 to 2009. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using a large administrative health insurance claims database covering 45 large employers. From this database, 995 unique patients with CML were identified, with 3,765 patient-years; of these patients, 415 (or 1,689 patientyears) were TKI users. We estimated the association of TKI use with total pharmaceutical spending and total non-pharmaceutical medical spending. In addition, we characterized plan-level cost-sharing rules for TKIs and assessed whether these were associated with the MPR for TKI therapy among CML patients. RESULTS: TKI users averaged $26,406 in annual non-pharmaceutical medical spending, compared with $38,194 for non-users; this was a difference of approximately 30%, which was statistically significant at the 5% level. The median patient out-ofpocket payment was $25, which increased to $63 at the 75th percentile and to $122 at the 95th percentile. MPRs were 94.8 at the median cost-sharing level and 100.0 at the 75th percentile and higher. There was no statistically significant association between cost-sharing and MPR. CONCLUSIONS: Use of TKIs was associated with a 30% reduction in non-pharmaceutical medical spending for CML patients. This difference is approximately equal to 40% of the incremental pharmaceutical cost associated with using TKI therapy. The net annual cost of TKI therapy is roughly $15,000. An informal calculation suggests that this is well within the range of conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. On balance, coverage of TKIs is relatively generous, with the vast majority of patients exhibiting high levels of adherence to therapy.",,"['Leonard D.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry comprising all US patients with CML diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 (N = 9,760). METHODS: We quantified the option value of recent breakthroughs in CML treatment by first conducting retrospective survival analyses on SEER data to assess the effectiveness of TKI treatments, and then forecasting survival from CML and other causes to measure expected future medical progress. We then developed an analytical framework to calculate option value of innovative CML therapies, and used an economic model to value these gains. We calculated the option value created both by future innovations in CML treatment and by medical progress in reducing background mortality. RESULTS: For a recently diagnosed CML patient, the option value of innovative therapies from future medical innovation amounts to 0.76 life-years. This option value is worth $63,000, equivalent to 9% of the average survival gains from existing treatments. Future innovations in CML treatment jointly account for 96% of this benefit.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the total value of survival gains associated with first- and second-line TKI therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the fraction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)- related survival-gain value retained by patients and drug companies. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study identified CML patient data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry, dasatinib clinical trials, and insurance claims data sets. METHODS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate improvements in CML survival associated with the introduction of first-line imatinib therapy. Survival gains associated with second-line dasatinib treatment were identified via retrospective analyses and published clinical outcomes. An economic model was developed to calculate the social value of survival gains derived from first- and second-line TKI treatment. TKI costs were used to estimate the fraction of survival gain value retained by patients and drug companies. RESULTS: The introduction of TKIs in 2001 was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.833 (P <.01). Cost analyses indicate that the TKI drug class in CML therapy has created more than $143 billion in social value. Approximately 90% of this value is retained by patients and society, while approximately 10% is recouped by drug companies.

The IQ was measured using the Raven's test in these patients. RESULTS: Raven's test revealed significant differences in IQ between the survivors of ALL that were treated with IT MTX, IT MTX plus cranial irradiation and control group. There was no significant difference in the IQ with respect to sex, age and irradiation dose.

Epub 2012 Aug 28.,"BACKGROUND: Oncologists today are greatly concerned about the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute leukemia. FLANG regimen, combination of novantron, cytarabine, fludarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, has been used in treatment of refractory/relapsed acute leukemia since 1990s. The present study has evaluated mortality and response rate of this regimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 25 patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia aged 15-55 years underwent FLANG regimen at Seyed-Al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan, Iran during 2008-2009. One month later, bone marrow samples were taken to evaluate the responsiveness to treatment. Participants were followed for a year. The data was analyzed by student-t and chi-square tests, logistic, and Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier curves in SPSS(19). RESULTS: Out of the 25 patients, 8 patients (32%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5 refractory and 3 relapsed cases) and 17 subjects had acute myeloid leukemia (7 refractory and 10 relapsed cases). According to the bone marrow biopsies taken one month after FLANG regimen, 10 patients (40%) had responded to treatment. Five patients of the 10 responders underwent successful bone marrow transplantation (BMT). On the other hand, 13 patients (52%), who had not entered the CR period, died during the follow-up. Logistic regression analysis did not reveal any significant associations between disease type and responsiveness to treatment. CONCLUSION: This study indicated higher rates of unresponsiveness to treatment while its mortality rate was comparable with other studies. Overall, according to limitations for BMT (as the only chance for cure) in Iran, it seems that FLANG therapy is an acceptable choice for these patients.",,"['Department of internal medicine, Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'FLANG regimen', 'Refractory acute leukemia', 'Relapsed acute leukemia']",,PMC3544098,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 9.,"Binding of ligand FasL to its receptor Fas triggers apoptosis via the caspase cascade. FasL itself is homotrimeric, and a productive apoptotic signal requires that FasL be oligomerized beyond the homotrimeric state. We generated a series of FasL chimeras by fusing FasL to domains of the Leukemia Inhibitory Factor receptor gp190 which confer homotypic oligomerization, and analyzed the capacity of these soluble chimeras to trigger cell death. We observed that the most efficient FasL chimera, called pFasL, was also the most polymeric, as it reached the size of a dodecamer. Using a cellular model, we investigated the structure-function relationships of the FasL/Fas interactions for our chimeras, and we demonstrated that the Fas-mediated apoptotic signal did not solely rely on ligand-mediated receptor aggregation, but also required a conformational adaptation of the Fas receptor. When injected into mice, pFasL did not trigger liver injury at a dose which displayed anti-tumor activity in a model of human tumor transplanted to immunodeficient animals, suggesting a potential therapeutic use. Therefore, the optimization of the FasL conformation has to be considered for the development of efficient FasL-derived anti-cancer drugs targeting Fas.",,"['Unite Mixte de Recherche Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 5164, Universite de Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France.']",,,,,,,,PMC3541234,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 9.,"In drug discovery, the characterisation of the precise modes of action (MoA) and of unwanted off-target effects of novel molecularly targeted compounds is of highest relevance. Recent approaches for identification of MoA have employed various techniques for modeling of well defined signaling pathways including structural information, changes in phenotypic behavior of cells and gene expression patterns after drug treatment. However, efficient approaches focusing on proteome wide data for the identification of MoA including interference with mutations are underrepresented. As mutations are key drivers of drug resistance in molecularly targeted tumor therapies, efficient analysis and modeling of downstream effects of mutations on drug MoA is a key to efficient development of improved targeted anti-cancer drugs. Here we present a combination of a global proteome analysis, reengineering of network models and integration of apoptosis data used to infer the mode-of-action of various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines expressing wild type as well as TKI resistance conferring mutants of BCR-ABL. The inferred network models provide a tool to predict the main MoA of drugs as well as to grouping of drugs with known similar kinase inhibitory activity patterns in comparison to drugs with an additional MoA. We believe that our direct network reconstruction approach, demonstrated on proteomics data, can provide a complementary method to the established network reconstruction approaches for the preclinical modeling of the MoA of various types of targeted drugs in cancer treatment. Hence it may contribute to the more precise prediction of clinically relevant on- and off-target effects of TKIs.",,"['Department of Oncology, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald-Tumor Zentrum UCCH, University Hospital Eppendorf UKE, Hamburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,PMC3541187,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these Hox gene derivatives are believed to act as transcription regulators, the molecular involvement of the Hox gene derivatives in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis remains largely elusive. Since we previously showed that Hoxb4 forms a complex with a Roc1-Ddb1-Cul4a ubiquitin ligase core component and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase activator for Geminin, we here examined the E3 ubiquitin ligase activities of the 5'-located Hox genes, Hoxa9 and Hoxc13, and Nup98-Hoxa9. Hoxa9 formed a similar complex with the Roc1-Ddb1-Cul4a component to induce ubiquitination of Geminin, but the others did not. Retroviral transduction-mediated overexpression or siRNA-mediated knock-down of Hoxa9 respectively down-regulated or up-regulated Geminin in hematopoietic cells.

However, the mechanism of action of the activated ERM protein in the drug resistance of MOLT4 cells induced by CCL25 remains uncharacterized. Here we investigated the mechanism of CCR9/CCL25-initiated drug resistance in CCR9-high-expressing T-ALL cells. Our results showed that 1) the function of P-gp was increased after treatment with CCL25; 2) P-gp colocalized and co-immunoprecipitated with p-ERM and F-actin in CCL25 treated cells; and 3) ERM-shRNA conferred drug sensitivity coincident with release of ERM interactions with P-gp and F-actin after treatment with CCL25. These data suggest it is pivotal that P-gp associate with the F-actin cytoskeleton through p-ERM in CCR9/CCL25 induced multidrug resistance of T-ALL cells. Strategies aimed at inhibiting P-gp-F-actin cytoskeleton association may be helpful in increasing the efficiency of therapies in T-ALL.",,"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",,,,,,,,PMC3541277,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter include aggressive SM (ASM), mast cell leukemia (MCL), and SM associated with a myeloid neoplasm wherein 1 or both disease compartments exhibit advanced features. These variants, henceforth collectively referred to as advanced SM for the purposes of this report, are typically characterized by organ damage and shortened survival duration. In contrast to indolent SM, in which symptoms are usually managed by noncytotoxic antimediator therapy, cytoreduction is usually necessary for disease control in advanced SM. Unfortunately, current drug treatment of these patients rarely results in complete clinical and histopathologic remissions or improved survival time. Previously defined response criteria were adapted to the heterogeneous presentations of advanced SM and the limited effects of available drugs. However, recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of SM and the corresponding prospect in targeted therapy make it a priority to modify these criteria.

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"HS1 (hematopoietic cell-specific Lyn substrate-1) is a cytoskeletal interactor in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway whose phosphorylation correlates with prognosis in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The differentially phosphorylated sites and the kinases that regulate HS1 activity in CLL remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that HS1 activity is differentially regulated by LYN kinase that, in a subset of patients, phosphorylates HS1 on Tyrosine (Y)397, resulting in its activation. This correlates with increased cytoskeletal functionality in terms of migration, adhesion and F-actin polymerization. In these patients, LYN is also activated on Y396 residue and its inhibition with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib abrogates HS1-Y397 phosphorylation. This results in the reduction of HS1 activation along with that of cytoskeletal effector VAV1 and the downstream kinase ERK also in the presence of BCR and CXC chemokine receptor CXCR4 stimulation. Interestingly, targeting the LYN/HS1 axis in vitro leads to the concomitant reduction of cytoskeletal activity, BCR signaling and cell survival in the subset of patients with activated LYN/HS1. In a transplantable mouse model based on the EmuTCL1 transgenic mouse, LYN/HS1 signaling inhibition interferes with CLL progression and lymphoid organ infiltration. Thus LYN/HS1 axis marks distinct signaling profiles and cytoskeletal-related features that may represent valuable targets for cytoskeleton-targeted therapeutic intervention in CLL.",,"['Division of Molecular Oncology, Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cancer, malignant cells modify the immune microenvironment to block effective host antitumor responses. We show for the first time that CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibit globally impaired LFA-1-mediated migration and that this defect is mediated by direct tumor cell contact. We show that following the coculture of previously healthy T cells with CLL cells, subsequent LFA-1 engagement leads to altered Rho GTPase activation signaling by downregulating RhoA and Rac1, while upregulating Cdc42. Of clinical relevance, repair of this T-cell defect was demonstrated using the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, which completely rescued adhesion and motility function by restoring normal Rho GTPase activation signaling. Our report identifies a novel cancer immune evasion mechanism whereby tumor cells induce Rho GTPase signaling defects in T cells that prevent appropriate LFA-1 activation and motility.

YM-155 inhibited cell growth and downregulated survivin and Mcl-1 in a dose- and cell line-dependent manner. While U373, LN18, LNZ428, T98G, LN229, and LNZ308 cells exhibited an IC(50) of 10 to 75 nmol/L, A172 cells were resistant (IC(50) approximately 250 nmol/L). No correlation was found between sensitivity to YM-155 and baseline expression of survivin or cIAP-1/cIAP-2/XIAP. However, strong correlation was observed between EGF receptor (EGFR) activation levels and YM-155 response, which was confirmed using EGFR-transduced versus wild-type cells. Because we postulated that decreasing Mcl-1 expression may enhance glioma sensitivity to ABT-737, we examined whether cotreatment with YM-155 promoted ABT-737 efficacy. YM-155 synergistically enhanced ABT-737-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Downregulation of Mcl-1 using short hairpin RNA also enhanced ABT-737-inducing killing, confirming an important role for Mcl-1 in mediating synergism between ABT-737 and YM-155. As with YM-155 alone, sensitivity to YM-155 and ABT-737 inversely correlated with EGFR activation status. However, sensitivity could be restored in highly resistant U87-EGFRvIII cells by inhibition of EGFR or its downstream pathways, highlighting the impact of EGFR signaling on Mcl-1 expression and the relevance of combined targeted therapies to overcome the multiple resistance mechanisms of these aggressive tumors.",,"[""Department of Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, USA.""]",,,,,,,"['R01 CA130966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 NS040923/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA158911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01NS40923/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA159811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA130966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3596447,['NIHMS436360'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"BACKGROUND: According to WHO 2008 guidelines, an important role is designated for cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase (cMPO) as measured by flow cytometry for classifying acute leukemia of myeloid or ambiguous origin (AML or MPAL). However, no threshold with respect to expression level and percentage positive cells is provided. Since the expression of solely cMPO can change the diagnosis from acute lymphoid leukemia into MPAL in the current WHO 2008, a consensus is needed for the cut-off for cMPO. METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether or not a cut-off of 10% positivity for cMPO equally defines an acute leukemia as AML or MPAL as compared to a cut-off for cMPO of 20% and compared this with results obtained for Sudan Black B (SBB) staining by cytomorphology. RESULTS: Cell lineage-defining markers and SBB staining were analyzed retrospectively in a cohort of 198 patients who presented with acute leukemia. Eight patients were positive for SBB (>3%), but were considered negative for cMPO (<10%); six patients were negative for SBB (</= 3%) and positive for cMPO (>/= 10%) staining. In six patients, we found 10-20% cMPO positive leukemic cells. Five of these cases were SBB positive; the sixth patient showed a clear myeloid phenotype without positivity of any lymphoid marker. Using a 10% cut-off instead of 20% would have changed diagnosis from ALL into MPAL in two patients; both cases were SBB positive by morphology. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a 10% cut-off is a secure lower limit for cMPO expression and can be used independently from SBB expression.",['Copyright (c) 2013 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Department of Hematology, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. w.vandenancker@vumc.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Cytometry B Clin Cytom. 2014 Jan;86(1):70-3.

The final histologic diagnosis of cases documented in this report is as follows: 1,270 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL); 17 composite lymphomas; four NHL plus carcinomas; five post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders; 105 Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL); eight acute leukemias; 42 tissue cancers; and 341 non-neoplastic diseases. A strong correlation between morphology and FC data was observed among hematological malignancies (1,268/1,304, 97.2%) with the exception of HL. Among B-NHL, FC detection of clonally restricted B-cell allowed the identification of lymphomas that were not histologically clear and the differential diagnosis between follicular lymphoma and reactive hyperplasia. A high correlation level (r = 0.83; P < 0.0001) was obtained in comparing proliferation results obtained by FC and immunohistochemistry. Among T-NHL, FC detection of an aberrant phenotype direct histologic diagnosis in cases having less than 20% of neoplastic cells. In nine cases, FC suggested the need to evaluate a neoplastic population, not morphologically evident. Results show that FC routinely performed on tissue samples suspected of lymphomas is a fundamental adjunct to morphology in the diagnosis of NHL and may enhance the performance of the histologic evaluation so as to achieve the final diagnosis.

In this study, glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay and mass spectrometry enabled identification of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) as a novel interaction partner for LEF1. The interaction between LEF1 and DNA-PKcs was confirmed using in vivo co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence observations showed that LEF1 and DNA-PKcs colocalized in the nuclei of colon adenocarcinoma cell lines.

We have isolated and identified four known cinnamamides from this plant: lansiumamide C, lansamide I, lansiumamide B, and SB-204900. However, the biological activities of these compounds are not yet understood. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the pharmacological effects of these compounds on mast cells. METHODS: We measured inflammatory molecules in A23187-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) treated with these compounds using HPLC, ELISA, and immunoblotting methods. In addition, some signaling molecules were investigated by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Lansamide I, lansiumamide B, and SB-204900 significantly decreased histamine release. Furthermore, lansiumamide B- and SB-204900-treated cells also reduced the protein and/or mRNA levels of TNF-alpha. SB-204900 markedly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK.

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the clinic, drug-resistant leukemias emerge in some patients because of either the acquisition of point mutations or amplification of the tyrosine kinase, resulting in a poor long-term prognosis. Here, we exploit the molecular mechanisms of caspase activation and tyrosine kinase/adaptor protein signaling to forge a unique approach for selectively killing leukemic cells through the forcible induction of apoptosis.

Given the nuclear industry located in the community and ongoing public health concerns, cancer incidence rates in Port Hope were studied for a recent 16 year period (1992-2007) for continued periodic cancer incidence surveillance of the community. The cancer incidence in the local community for all cancers combined was similar to the Ontario population, health regions with similar socio-economic characteristics in Ontario and in Canada, and the Canadian population. No statistically significant differences in childhood cancer, leukaemia or other radiosensitive cancer incidence were observed, with the exception of statistically significant elevated lung cancer incidence among women. However, the statistical significance was reduced or disappeared when the comparison was made to populations with similar socio-economic characteristics. These findings are consistent with previous ecological, case-control and cohort studies conducted in Port Hope, environmental assessments, and epidemiological studies conducted elsewhere on populations living around similar facilities or exposed to similar environmental contaminants. Although the current study covered an extended period of time, the power to detect risk at the sub-regional level of analysis was limited since the Port Hope population is small (16,500). The study nevertheless indicated that large differences in cancer incidence are not occurring in Port Hope compared to other similar communities and the general population.",,"['Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada, 2720 Riverside Drive, Ottawa, K1A 0K9, Canada. jing.chen@hc-sc.gc.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"Glioblastomas are grade IV brain tumors characterized by high aggressiveness and invasiveness, giving patients a poor prognosis. We investigated the effects of the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib on six cultures isolated from human glioblastomas and maintained in tumor initiating cells-enriching conditions. These cell subpopulations are thought to be responsible for tumor recurrence and radio- and chemo-resistance, representing the perfect target for glioblastoma therapy. Sorafenib reduces proliferation of glioblastoma cultures, and this effect depends, at least in part, on the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, both involved in gliomagenesis. Sorafenib significantly induces apoptosis/cell death via downregulation of the survival factor Mcl-1. We provide evidence that sorafenib has a selective action on glioblastoma stem cells, causing enrichment of cultures in differentiated cells, downregulation of the expression of stemness markers required to maintain malignancy (nestin, Olig2 and Sox2) and reducing cell clonogenic ability in vitro and tumorigenic potential in vivo. The selectivity of sorafenib effects on glioblastoma stem cells is confirmed by the lower sensitivity of glioblastoma cultures after differentiation as compared with the undifferentiated counterpart. Since current GBM therapy enriches the tumor in cancer stem cells, the evidence of a selective action of sorafenib on these cells is therapeutically relevant, even if, so far, results from first phase II clinical trials did not demonstrate its efficacy.",,"['Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES), University of Genova, Genova, Italy.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'glioblastoma', 'sorafenib', 'stemness', 'therapy', 'tumor initiating cells']",,PMC3587450,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Expression and correlation of bcl-2, bax and ER proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry staining in 36 adenomyosis cases with superficial (< 1/2 depth of penetration) and deep (>/= 1/2 depth of penetration) ectopic endometrium and eutopic endometrial tissues matched with 30 cases with benign ovarian tumor, uterine septum, pelvic floor dysfunction without adenomyosis as controls. RESULTS: (1) The expression of ER protein in superficial and deep ectopic tissues (5.04 +/- 0.24, 4.91 +/- 0.16) were found significantly lower than 6.06 +/- 0.36 in eutopic tissues (P < 0.01) and higher than 3.70 +/- 0.58 in control group (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference of ER expression in superficial and deep ectopic endometrium (P > 0.05). (2) The level of bcl-2 protein of 5.6 +/- 0.4 in superficial and 6.0 +/- 0.3 in deep myometrium of ectopic tissues were significantly higher than 3.6 +/- 0.4 in eutopic tissues and 1.9 +/- 0.4 in control group (P < 0.01). (3) The level of bax protein of 3.50 +/- 0.28 in superficial and 4.80 +/- 0.29 in deep myometrial ectopic and 4.43 +/- 0.37 in eutopic tissues were significantly lower than 6.18 +/- 0.65 in control groups (P < 0.05). The expression of bax in superficial myometrium is significantly lower than deep myometrium in ectopic tissues (P < 0.01). (4) The positive correlation between the expression of ER and bcl-2 protein at superficial myometrium of ectopic tissues (r = 0.720, P < 0.01). And there was no significant correlation with the expression of ER and bax protein at superficial myometrium (r = 0.008, P > 0.05). As well as, there was not significant correlation with the expression of bcl-2, bax and ER protein at deep myometrium (r = 0.089, r = -0.023, P > 0.05). The expression of bax protein in ectopic endometrium was positive correlation with the depth of adenomyosis penetration (r = 0.736, P < 0.01). There was positive correlation between the expression of ER and bcl-2 protein at normal endometrium (r = 0.453, P < 0.05). And there was negative correlation between the expression of ER and bax protein at control group (r = -0.514, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The bax protein expression of ectopic endometrium in deep adenomyosis was higher than superficial adenomyosis.",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Affiliated Beijing Anzhen Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China. anzhenlibin@126.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. CONCLUSIONS: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

Experiments were carried out in a well-established mouse model of human Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). Mouse-derived pro-B Ba/F3 cells transfected with and stably expressing the human p210(BCR-ABL) drug-sensitive wild-type BCR-ABL or the V299L or T315I p210(BCR-ABL) drug-resistant BCR-ABL mutants were exposed to imatinib-mesylate (IMA) or dasatinib (DAS). MicroFTIR was carried out at the Diamond IR beamline MIRIAM where the mid-IR absorbance spectra of individual Ba/F3 cells were acquired using the high brilliance IR synchrotron radiation (SR) via aperture of 15 x 15 mum(2) in sizes. A conventional IR source (globar) was used to compare average spectra over 15 cells or more. IR signatures of drug actions were identified by supervised analyses in the spectra of TKI-sensitive cells. Unsupervised HCA applied to selected intervals of wavenumber allowed us to classify the IR patterns of viable (drug-resistant) and apoptotic (drug-sensitive) cells with an accuracy of >95%. The results from microFTIR + HCA analysis were cross-validated with those obtained via immunochemical methods, i.e. immunoblotting and flow cytometry (FC) that resulted directly and significantly correlated.

The tumor was composed of undifferentiated small round cells containing eosinophilic cytoplasm, which were negative for myeloperoxidase, nonspecific esterase, lysozyme, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, leukocyte common antigen, CD3, CD4, CD15, CD20, CD30, CD43, CD56, CD68/PG-M1, CD79a, human melanoma black-45, c-kit, and CD34 with positivity only for CD68/KP1, CD99, and vimentin. Under electron microscopy, those cells had abundant membrane-bound cytoplasmic granules that measured 200 to 300 nm in diameter, which were consistent with granulocytic azurophilic granules.

This study analyzed the incidence of central nervous system relapse and the risk factors for its occurrence in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: This study has a retrospective cohort design. The studied population comprised 199 children and adolescents with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia followed up at Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG) between March 2001 and August 2009 and submitted to the Grupo Brasileiro de Tratamento de Leucemia da Infancia - acute lymphoblastic leukemia (GBTLI-LLA-99) treatment protocol.

Recent studies show that early lymphocyte recovery may be a predictor of relapse and survival in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of lymphocyte recovery on Days +30 and +100 post-transplant on the occurrence of relapse and survival. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study was performed of 137 under 21-year-old patients who we resubmitted to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute leukemia between 1995 and 2008. A lymphocyte count < 0.3 x 10(9)/L on Day +30 post-transplant was considered to be inadequate lymphocyte recovery and counts >/= 0.3 x 10(9)/L were considered adequate. Lymphocyte recovery was also analyzed on Day +100 with < 0.75 x 10(9)/Land </= 0.75 x 10(9)/L being considered inadequate and adequate lymphocyte recovery, respectively. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the occurrence of relapse between patients with inadequate and adequate lymphocyte recovery on Day +30 post-transplant. However, the transplant-related mortality was significantly higher in patients with inadequate recovery on Day +30. Patients with inadequate lymphocyte recovery on Day +30 had worse overall survival and relapse-free survival than patients with adequate recovery. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of infections and acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Patients with inadequate lymphocyte recovery on Day +100 had worse overall survival and relapse-free survival and a higher cumulative incidence of relapse. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of lymphocyte recovery on Day +30 is not a good predictor of relapse after transplant however patients with inadequate lymphocyte recovery had worse overall survival and relapse-free survival.

Retinoids exert their actions mainly through binding to the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (alpha, beta, gamma), which are transcriptional and homeostatic regulators with functions that are often compromised early in neoplastic transformation. The retinoids have been investigated extensively for their use in cancer prevention and treatment. Success has been achieved with their use in the treatment of subtypes of leukemia harboring chromosomal translocations. Promising results have been observed in the breast cancer prevention setting, where fenretinide prevention trials have provided a strong rationale for further investigation in young women at high risk for breast cancer. Ongoing phase III randomized trials investigating retinoids in combination with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer aim to definitively characterize the role of retinoids in this tumor type.

Although its function in RNA splicing for effective cell cycle progression and genome stability was recently unveiled, other mechanisms of SON functions remain unexplored. Here, we report that SON regulates GATA-2, a key transcription factor involved in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation. SON is highly expressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and leukemic blasts. SON knockdown leads to significant depletion of GATA-2 protein with marginal down-regulation of GATA-2 mRNA. We show that miR-27a is up-regulated upon SON knockdown and targets the 3'-UTR of GATA-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells. Up-regulation of miR-27a was due to activation of the promoter of the miR-23a approximately 27a approximately 24-2 cluster, suggesting that SON suppresses this promoter to lower the microRNAs from this cluster. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role of SON in microRNA production via regulating the transcription process, thereby modulating GATA-2 at the protein level during hematopoietic differentiation.",,"['Moores UCSD Cancer Center, the University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",,,,,,,"['F32 HL091641/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3581430,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 15.,"While small-molecule inhibitors of class I/II histone deacetylases (HDAC) have been approved for cancer treatment, inhibitors of the sirtuins (a family of class III HDACs) still require further validation and optimization to enter clinical trials. Recent studies show that tenovin-6, a small-molecule inhibitor of sirtuins SirT1 and SirT2, reduces tumor growth in vivo and eliminates leukemic stem cells in a murine model for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Here, we describe a tenovin analogue, tenovin-D3, that preferentially inhibits sirtuin SirT2 and induces predicted phenotypes for SirT2 inhibition. Unlike tenovin-6 and in agreement with its weak effect on SirT1 (a p53 deacetylase), tenovin-D3 fails to increase p53 levels or transcription factor activity. However, tenovin-D3 promotes expression of the cell-cycle regulator and p53 target p21(WAF1/CIP1) (CDKN1A) in a p53-independent manner. Structure-activity relationship studies strongly support that the ability of tenovin-D3 to inhibit SirT2 contributes to this p53-independent induction of p21. The ability of tenovin-D3 to increase p21 mRNA and protein levels is shared with class I/II HDAC inhibitors currently used in the clinic and therefore suggests that SirT2 inhibition and class I/II HDAC inhibitors have similar effects on cell-cycle progression.",,"['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,"['10-0043/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', '6950/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This risk is associated both with those applying the pesticide and, under some conditions, those who are simply bystanders to the application. In this article, the epidemiological, molecular biology, and toxicological evidence emerging from recent literature assessing the link between specific pesticides and several cancers including prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer are integrated. Although the review is not exhaustive in its scope or depth, the literature does strongly suggest that the public health problem is real. If we are to avoid the introduction of harmful chemicals into the environment in the future, the integrated efforts of molecular biology, pesticide toxicology, and epidemiology are needed to help identify the human carcinogens and thereby improve our understanding of human carcinogenicity and reduce cancer risk.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Cancer Society, Inc.']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, North Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. alavanjm@mail.nih.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['CA Cancer J Clin. 2013 Sep;63(5):366-7.

Epub 2013 Jan 15.,"BACKGROUND: The frontline treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. There is increasing evidence that imatinib results in growth failure in children; etiology is unclear. PROCEDURE: The cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2011 to June 2012 in a pediatric oncology unit. Patients with chronic-phase CML, receiving imatinib for more than 6 months were enrolled. Growth hormone (GH): Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis was evaluated by GH stimulation test by insulin tolerance and clonidine stimulation test, among other hormonal assays. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with a median age of 12.9 years (range 6.5-17) completed the study. The mean duration of imatinib therapy was 43.7 +/- 32.8 months. The height-for-age z-scores at the start of imatinib and at enrollment were -1.07 +/- 0.88 and -1.8 +/- 0.98, respectively (P < 0.001). Seven (39%) patients were GH deficient and lacked a sufficient response to either of the two stimulation tests. Majority, 16 (89%) patients had IGF-1 z-scores less than the mean. IGFBP-3 levels were below the mean in all patients. Every patient had deficiency of either GH, or IGF-1, or both. Bone age was delayed in 7 (39%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that imatinib results in growth failure in children with CML by disturbing the GH:IGF-1 axis. GH stimulation test and serum IGF-1 levels should be performed in children on treatment with imatinib who have growth retardation. Future studies should evaluate the role of recombinant GH therapy for ameliorating the adverse effect on growth.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatric Center, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with a striking risk of early hemorrhagic death due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis. The prognosis of APL has improved dramatically following the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy during induction and consolidation. Patients with high-risk APL, defined by a white cell count >10 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis, also appear to benefit from the addition of intermediate- or high-dose cytarabine during consolidation. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has proved to be even more effective than ATRA as a single agent, and is now routinely used for the treatment of the 20%-30% of patients who manifest disease relapse after initial treatment with ATRA and chemotherapy. ATO has a toxicity profile that differs considerably from that of both ATRA and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and accordingly presents its own specific challenges during treatment. Optimizing a strategy for the incorporation of ATO into initial therapy is currently the focus of several cooperative group trials, with an emphasis on minimizing or even eradicating the use of chemotherapy. ATRA plus ATO without chemotherapy appears to be adequate during induction and consolidation for patients with standard-risk APL, but triple therapy that includes limited anthracycline or gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) during induction is required for high-risk APL. Uncertainty still exists regarding the minimum amount of chemotherapy and number of consolidation cycles necessary, the optimal scheduling of ATO, and the potential utility of oral ATO administration. Although prolonged oral maintenance therapy is usually included in most current APL treatment protocols, its value remains controversial, and the superior anti-leukemic efficacy of ATO-based therapy may facilitate its elimination in the future.",,"['Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Missenden Rd, Camperdown, NSW, Australia 2050. harry@email.cs.nsw.gov.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing doses of RAD001 from 10-70 mg were administrated orally on days 1 and 7 (d1 and d7) of a 3+7 daunorubicin+cytarabine conventional induction chemotherapy regimen. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in this trial. The treatment was well tolerated with <10% toxicity, mainly involving the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. In this phase Ib trial, the RAD001 maximum tolerated dose was not reached at 70 mg. Sixty-eight percent of patients achieved CR, of which 14 received a double induction.

Dust samples were collected from homes of 269 ALL cases and 333 healthy controls (<8 years of age at diagnosis/reference date and residing in same home since diagnosis/reference date) in California, using a high-volume surface sampler or household vacuum bags. Amounts of agricultural or professional herbicides (alachlor, metolachlor, bromoxynil, bromoxynil octanoate, pebulate, butylate, prometryn, simazine, ethalfluralin, and pendimethalin) and residential herbicides (cyanazine, trifluralin, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), mecoprop, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), chlorthal, and dicamba) were measured.

Models included the herbicide of interest, age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, year and season of dust sampling, neighborhood type, and residence type. The risk of childhood ALL was associated with dust levels of chlorthal; compared to homes with no detections, ORs for the first, second, and third tertiles were 1.49 (95% CI: 0.82-2.72), 1.49 (95% CI: 0.83-2.67), and 1.57 (95% CI: 0.90-2.73), respectively (P-value for linear trend=0.05).

Treatment with various drugs has been attempted, but none has resulted in cure or complete virus elimination. Human interferon-alpha2a (huIFN-alpha2a) and 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) have been proven to decrease antigenaemia in cats infected experimentally with FeLV. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of huIFN-alpha2a, AZT and a combination of both drugs in cats infected naturally with FeLV in a placebo-controlled double-blinded trial. Fourty-four FeLV-infected cats in which free FeLV p27 antigen was detected in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were included in the study. Cats were assigned to one of four treatment groups that received either high dose huIFN-alpha2a (10(5) IU/kg q24h; 12 cats), AZT (5 mg/kg q12h; 10 cats, both of these treatments (12 cats) or placebo (10 cats). All cats were treated for 6 weeks. Clinical variables, including stomatitis, and laboratory parameters, such as CD4(+) and CD8(+) counts and serum FeLV p 27 antigen concentration, were recorded throughout the treatment period. No significant difference among the groups was observed during the treatment period for any of the parameters. Aside from anaemia in one cat treated with AZT, no adverse effects were observed.

We also compared the effects of SAHA to those of valproic acid (VPA), a short-chain fatty acid HDACi. SAHA and VPA induced histone H3 and H4 acetylation, myeloid differentiation and massive early apoptosis. The latter effects were not determined by either drug in AML cell lines, such as NB4 or THP-1, not expressing AML1/ETO. SAHA was more rapid and effective than VPA in increasing H3 and H4 acetylation in total Kasumi-1 cell lysates and more effective than VPA in inducing acetylation of H4K8, H4K12, H4K16 residues. At the promoter of IL3, a transcriptionally-silenced target of AML1/ETO, SAHA was also more rapid than VPA in inducing total H4, H4K5, H4K8 and H3K27 acetylation, while VPA was more effective than SAHA at later times in inducing acetylation of total H4, H4K12, H4K16, as well as total H3. Consistent with these differences, SAHA induced the expression of IL3 mRNA more rapidly than VPA, while the effect of VPA was delayed. These differences might be exploited to design clinical trials specifically directed to AML subtypes characterized by constitutive HDAC activation.

Here, we report that miR-148a is repressed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) to promote cancer growth and metastasis in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hematopoietic pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor-interacting protein (HPIP) is an important regulator of cancer cell growth. We used miRNA target prediction programs to identify miR-148a as a regulator of HPIP. Expression of miR-148a in hepatoma cells reduced HPIP expression, leading to repression of AKT and ERK and subsequent inhibition of mTOR through the AKT/ERK/FOXO4/ATF5 pathway. HBx has been shown to play a critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC. We found that HBx suppressed p53-mediated activation of miR-148a. Moreover, expression of miR-148a was downregulated in patients with HBV-related liver cancer and negatively correlated with HPIP, which was upregulated in patients with liver cancer. In cultured cells and a mouse xenograft model, miR-148a reduced the growth, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis of HBx-expressing hepatocarcinoma cells through inhibition of HPIP-mediated mTOR signaling. Thus, miR-148a activation or HPIP inhibition may be a useful strategy for cancer treatment.",,"[""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,PMC3561812,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, periconceptual nutritional influences may modulate the establishment of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation at MEs. Based on these characteristics, we exploited Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip kits in a 2-tissue parallel screen on peripheral blood leukocyte and colonic mucosal DNA from 10 children without identifiable large intestinal disease. This approach led to the delineation of 1776 CpG sites meeting our criteria for MEs, which associated with 1013 genes. The list of ME candidates exhibited overlaps with recently identified human genes (including CYP2E1 and MGMT, where methylation has been associated with Parkinson disease and glioblastoma, respectively) in which perinatal DNA methylation levels where linked to maternal periconceptual nutrition. One hundred 18 (11.6%) of the ME candidates overlapped with genes where DNA methylation correlated (r > 0.871; p < 0.055) with expression in the colon mucosa of 5 independent control children. Genes involved in homophilic cell adhesion (including cadherin-associated genes) and developmental processes were significantly overrepresented in association with MEs. Additional filtering of gene expression-correlated MEs defined 35 genes, associated with 2 or more CpG sites within a 10 kb genomic region, fulfilling the ME criteria. DNA methylation changes at a number of these genes have been linked to various forms of human disease, including cancers, such as asthma and acute myeloid leukemia (ALOX12), gastric cancer (EBF3), breast cancer (NAV1), colon cancer and acute lymphoid leukemia (KCNK15), Wilms tumor (protocadherin gene cluster; PCDHAs) and colorectal cancer (TCERG1L), suggesting a potential etiologic role for MEs in tumorigenesis and underscoring the possible developmental origins of these malignancies.

Epub 2013 Jan 15.,"Over the past two decades, aberrant DNA methylation has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and knowledge regarding its biological and clinical consequences in this disease has evolved rapidly. Since the initial studies relating DNA hypomethylation to genomic instability in CLL, a plethora of reports have followed showing the impact of DNA hypermethylation in silencing vital single gene promoters and the reversible nature of DNA methylation through inhibitor drugs. With the recognition that DNA hypermethylation events could potentially act as novel prognostic and treatment targets in CLL, the search for aberrantly methylated genes, gene families and pathways has ensued. Subsequently, the advent of microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies has supported the hunt for such targets, allowing exploration of the methylation landscape in CLL at an unprecedented scale. In light of these analyses, we now understand that different CLL prognostic subgroups are characterized by differential methylation profiles; we recognize DNA methylation of a number of signaling pathways genes to be altered in CLL, and acknowledge the role of DNA methylation outside of traditional CpG island promoters as fundamental players in the regulation of gene expression. Today, the significance and timing of altered DNA methylation within the complex epigenetic network of concomitant epigenetic messengers such as histones and miRNAs is an intensive area of research. In CLL, it appears that DNA methylation is a rather stable epigenetic mark occurring rather early in the disease pathogenesis. However, other consequences, such as how and why aberrant methylation marks occur, are less explored. In this review, we will not only provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature within the epigenetics field of CLL, but also highlight some of the novel findings relating to when, where, why and how altered DNA methylation materializes in CLL.",,"['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology; Uppsala University; Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CpG islands', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'gene silencing', 'hypermethylation', 'hypomethylation', 'microarrays', 'next-generation sequencing']",,PMC3592899,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin in particular, have come to be recognized for their influence on tumor biology including leukemia. The prognostic effect of leptin and adiponectin concentrations in acute leukemia patients remains to be identified. This study was conducted on 80 acute leukemia patients: 35 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 45 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and 20 controls of matched age and sex. Leptin and adiponectin were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis. Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in ALL patients, and significantly lower in AML patients when compared with normal controls (P = 0.01, P = 0.04 respectively). On the other hand, serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in AML and ALL patients as compared with normal controls (P = 0.00 for both). No significant differences exist regarding body mass index between acute leukemia patients and normal controls (P > 0.05). Correlation studies revealed that there were significant negative correlations between serum adiponectin levels and bone marrow (BM) blast cells and serum lactic dehydrogenase (sLDH) in acute leukemia groups (r 0.542, P < 0.01, r 0.699, P < 0.001, respectively).

Epub 2013 Jan 3.,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of blood-related malignancies caused by disorders of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It is mainly characterized by the ineffective hematopoiesis. Many MDS patients will transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with poor prognosis, often due to infection, hemorrhage and death. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the transformation remains unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of recently discovered noncoding RNA genes that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, are considered playing an important role in regulating gene translation during development. Aberrant expression of miRNAs plays an important role in the mutation of HSCs and their transformation to MDS stem cells, suggesting an important mechanism of MDS pathogenesis and its transformation to leukemia. So far, few studies have focused on molecular mechanisms of the transformation of MDS to AML. The role of miRNAs in the transformation needs to be fully understood. Here, we reviewed the molecular mechanism of miRNA involvement in the damage of HSCs, the pathogenesis of MDS and its transformation to leukemia. These results will be of theoretical importance for understanding the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of MDS, and have potential applications in the prevention and treatment of MDS and in preventing its transformation to leukemia.",,"['Medical English Department, College of Basic Medicine, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 15.,"The aim of our study was to analyze the factors contributing to heterogeneity of prognosis in patients with hyperdiploidy>50 chromosomes (HD>50), a group of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with favorable outcome. The 541 HD>50 patients registered prospectively in the 58951 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Children's Leukemia Group (CLG) trial, identified by karyotype (446 patients) and by DNA index (DI) (490 patients), had a 6-year event-free survival (EFS) of 89.0% (standard error [SE] = 1.5%) and a 6-year overall survival (OS) of 95.9% (SE = 0.9%). The strongest prognostic factor was the modal number of chromosomes (MNC): the 6-year EFS of 51-53, 54-57, and 58-66 MNC groups were 80%, 89%, and 99%, respectively (P < .0001). Ploidy assessed by DI was also a favorable factor: the higher the DI, the better the outcome. The 6-year EFS of the 3 subgroups of DI < 1.16/>/=1.16-<1.24/>/=1.24 were 83%, 90%, and 95%, respectively (P = .009). All usual combinations of trisomies (chromosomes 4, 10, 17, 18) were significant favorable factors but had lower EFS when MNC was lower than 58. In multivariate analysis, MNC remained the strongest factor. Consequently, the best indicator for excellent outcome was ploidy assessed by karyotype because patients with 58-66 chromosomes stood every chance of being cured (OS of 100% at 6-year follow-up) with less-intensive therapy.

Modern risk factors include KIT and/or FLT3 gene mutations and minimal residual disease (MRD) levels, but their respective values have never been prospectively assessed. A total of 198 CBF-AML patients were randomized between a reinforced and a standard induction course, followed by 3 high-dose cytarabine consolidation courses. MRD levels were monitored prospectively. Gene mutations were screened at diagnosis. Despite a more rapid MRD decrease after reinforced induction, induction arm did not influence relapse-free survival (RFS) (64% in both arms; P = .91). Higher WBC, KIT, and/or FLT3-ITD/TKD gene mutations, and a less than 3-log MRD reduction after first consolidation, were associated with a higher specific hazard of relapse, but MRD remained the sole prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. At 36 months, cumulative incidence of relapse and RFS were 22% vs 54% (P < .001) and 73% vs 44% (P < .001) in patients who achieved 3-log MRD reduction vs the others. These results suggest that MRD, rather than gene mutations, should be used for future treatment stratifications in CBF-AML patients.

Here, we report that Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) overexpressed and constitutively active in human AML, targets the RTK FLT3 in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Abrogation of Axl activation by soluble Axl chimeric protein (Axl-Fc) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) diminishes constitutive FLT3 phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. In addition, inhibition of Axl activation by Axl-Fc interferes with the physical interaction between Axl and FLT3. We found that Axl-Fc, a pharmacologic Axl inhibitor, or siRNA targeting Axl inhibits cell growth, induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and relieves a block in myeloid differentiation of FLT3-ITD(+) AML in vitro. Axl-Fc also suppresses the growth of human FLT3-ITD(+) AML in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that Axl contributes to the pathogenesis of FLT3-ITD(+) AML through, at least in part, positive regulation of constitutive FLT3 activation.

Epub 2012 Nov 15.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a clonal myeloproliferative disorder, is characterized primarily by the presence of chimeric BCR-ABL oncogene, and its progression from chronic to blast phase is associated with the accumulation of additional molecular and chromosomal abnormalities. The molecular mechanisms underlying this genetic instability are poorly understood. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to be associated with the increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and spontaneous DNA damage, which when effected by impaired/inaccurate DNA repair systems result in increased susceptibility to CML progression. Using case-control study design, we explored possible association of the repair gene, XRCC1, particularly the codons 399, 280, and 194 polymorphisms screened through PCR-RFLP, with the CML in the sample of 350 cases (206 male and 144 female) and 350 controls from Hyderabad, the capital city of state of the Andhra Pradesh, India. The patient group constituted 301 early chronic phase cases followed by 28 accelerated and 21 blast phase cases. The median age of the patients was 42 years (range, 9-70 years). The genotype distribution revealed significant association of codons 399 (chi(2) = 11.904, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 2; P = 0.002) and 194 (chi(2) = 8.091, d.f. = 2, P = 0.017) with CML, not 280 (P = 0.29). Although these polymorphisms are known to affect the function of XRCC1, the nature and extent of their genetic association with CML does not indicate their direct role in its development. The results seem to suggest that XRCC1 gene might have an important role in CML progression but not in its causation.",,"['Indian Statistical Institute, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 16.,"BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions are common in older adults and also may modulate the immune system. However, the impact of transfusion on cancer risk in the elderly has not been studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cancer risk after blood transfusion was evaluated in a US population-based case-control study using 552,951 elderly cases identified from cancer registries and 100,000 frequency-matched controls. Transfusions received 0 to 12, 13 to 30, and 31 to 48 months before cancer diagnosis or selection date were identified using Medicare claims. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression models. A Bonferroni correction adjusted for multiple testing. RESULTS: Transfusions received 0 to 12 months before cancer diagnosis and/or selection were associated with significantly elevated risk of cancer overall (OR,2.05; 95% CI, 1.95-2.16) and cancer of the stomach; cancer of the colon; cancer of the liver, kidney, renal pelvis, and/or ureter; lymphoma; myeloma; and leukemia. No significant associations for cancer overall were observed for the two earlier intervals. No site was associated with transfusions received 13 to 30 or 31 to 48 months before diagnosis and/or selection. Nonetheless, overall cancer risk increased with the number of transfused periods (p-trend<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Risk of overall cancer and specific sites was elevated 0 to 12 months after blood transfusion and associated with multiple transfusions, possibly due to reverse causation, that is, incipient cancers or cancer precursors causing anemia.",['(c) 2013 American Association of Blood Banks.'],"['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland; Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland; Information Management Services, Rockville, Maryland.']",,,,,,,['Z01 CP010182-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3633614,['NIHMS422698'],,,,,,,,,,,,

BMP-4 supplementation significantly reduced (p < 0.05) colony survival rate, percentage increase in colony area and relative mRNA abundance of OCT4, whereas that of NANOG and SOX-2 was increased significantly (p < 0.05). Noggin supplementation did not affect the colony survival rate and percentage increase in colony area in the presence of FGF-2 and LIF. In the presence of FGF-2 alone, it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the relative mRNA abundance of OCT4 and SOX-2 and increased (p < 0.05) that of NANOG. Supplementation with TGF-beta1 at 1.0 ng/ml but not at other concentrations increased colony survival rate but had no effect on percentage increase in colony area at any concentration. Supplementation with SB-431542 decreased (p < 0.05) colony survival rate at 50 mum but not at other concentrations. The percentage increase in colony area was lower (p < 0.05) with 10 mum SB-431542 than that in the controls, whereas at higher concentrations of 25 or 50 mum, SB-431542 decreased (p < 0.05) the colony size instead of increasing it.

Epub 2013 Mar 7.,"OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a severe disease for which allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the only potentially curative treatment. We describe a retrospective study determining prognostic factors for outcome after allo-SCT in consecutive 73 patients with CMML reported to the SFGM-TC registry between 1992 and 2009. RESULTS: At diagnosis, median age was 53 yrs, and 36% patients had palpable splenomegaly (SPM). 48, 13, and 9 patients had good, intermediate, and poor risk karyotype, respectively, according to IPSS, 61% patients had CMML-1, and 39% had CMML-2. 41/31/1 cases had an HLA-identical sibling, an unrelated and haploidentical donor, respectively. 43 patients received reduced-intensity conditioning. With a median follow-up of 23 month, acute grade 2-4 and chronic GVHD developed in 21 and 25 patients, respectively. The 3-year OS, NRM (non-relapse mortality),EFS, and CIR (cumulative incidence of relapse) were 32%, 36%, 29% and 35%, respectively. OS was not influenced by the CR status, marrow blasts% at allo-SCT, prior treatments, and cGVHD. Using multivariate analysis, year of transplant < 2004 (YOT) (P = 0.005) was associated with higher NRM, YOT <2004 (P = 0.04) and SPM at allo-SCT (P = 0.02) with lower EFS, and YOT < 2004 (P = 0.03) and SPM at allo-SCT (P = 0.04) with poorer OS. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a valid treatment option for patients with CMML, and its outcome has improved with YOT > 2004.

Epub 2013 Feb 24.,"Cytarabine (ara-C) is the key agent for treating acute myeloid leukemia. After being transported into leukemic cells, ara-C is phosphorylated, by several enzymes including deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), to ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), an active metabolite, and then incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of ara-C depends on the production of ara-CTP and the induction of apoptosis. Here, we established a new ara-C-resistant acute myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60/ara-C60) with dual resistance characteristics of the anti-antimetabolic character of decreased ara-CTP production and an increase in the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. We further attempted to overcome resistance by augmenting ara-CTP production and stimulating apoptosis. A relatively new nucleoside analog, 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G), and the small molecule Bcl-2 antagonist YC137 were used for this purpose. HL-60/ara-C60 was 60-fold more ara-C-resistant than the parental HL-60 cells. HL-60/ara-C60 cells exhibited low dCK protein expression, which resulted in decreased ara-CTP production. HL-60/ara-C60 cells were also refractory to ara-C-induced apoptosis due to overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Combination treatment of ara-C with ara-G augmented the dCK protein level, thereby increasing ara-CTP production and subsequent cytotoxicity. Moreover, the combination of ara-C with YC137 produced a greater amount of apoptosis than ara-C alone. Importantly, the three-drug combination of ara-C, ara-G and YC137 provided greater cytotoxicity than ara-C+ara-G or ara-C+YC137. These findings suggest possible combination strategies for overcoming ara-C resistance by augmenting ara-CTP production and reversing refractoriness against the induction of apoptosis in ara-C resistant leukemic cells.",['(c) 2013 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui, Japan.']",,,,,,,,PMC7657161,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of TPEN, an intracellular zinc chelator, in Jurkat and in ex vivo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells resistant to chemotherapy. Changes of nuclei morphology, reactive oxygen species generation, presence of hypodiploid cells, phosphatidylserine translocation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, immunohistochemical identification of cell death signalling molecules, and pharmacological inhibition were assayed to detect the apoptotic cell death pathways. We found that TPEN induces apoptosis in both types of cells by a molecular oxidative stress pathway involving O(2)(*-) > H(2)O(2) >> NF-kappaB (JNK/c-Jun) >p53> loss DeltaPsi(m)> caspase-3, AIF > chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, TPEN induced apoptosis independently of glucose; leukemic cells are therefore devoid of survival capacity by metabolic resistance to treatment. Most importantly, TPEN cytotoxic effect can eventually be regulated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and zinc ions.

Epub 2013 Jan 8.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant epigenetic patterns are central in the pathogenesis of haematopoietic diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Vorinostat is a HDACi which has produced responses in these disorders. The purpose of this study was to address the functional effects of vorinostat in leukemic cell lines and primary AML and MDS myeloid cells and to dissect the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which it exerts its action. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Functional assays showed vorinostat promoted cell cycle arrest, inhibited growth, and induced apoptosis and differentiation of K562, HL60 and THP-1 and of CD33(+) cells from AML and MDS patients. To explore the genetic mechanism for these effects, we quantified gene expression modulation by vorinostat in these cells. Vorinostat increased expression of genes down-regulated in MDS and/or AML (cFOS, COX2, IER3, p15, RAI3) and suppressed expression of genes over-expressed in these malignancies (AXL, c-MYC, Cyclin D1) and modulated cell cycle and apoptosis genes in a manner which would favor cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of neoplastic cells, consistent with the functional assays. Reporter assays showed transcriptional effect of vorinostat on some of these genes was mediated by proximal promoter elements in GC-rich regions. Vorinostat-modulated expression of some genes was potentiated by mithramycin A, a compound that interferes with SP1 binding to GC-rich DNA sequences, and siRNA-mediated SP1 reduction. ChIP assays revealed vorinostat inhibited DNA binding of SP1 to the proximal promoter regions of these genes. These results suggest vorinostat transcriptional action in some genes is regulated by proximal promoter GC-rich DNA sequences and by SP1. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the effects of vorinostat in AML and MDS and supports the implementation of clinical trials to explore the use of vorinostat in the treatment of these diseases.",,"['Unidade de Investigacao em Patobiologia Molecular, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, E.P.E., Lisboa, Portugal.']",,,,,,,,PMC3540071,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the mechanisms underlying GO and calicheamicin-gamma(1) resistance are incompletely understood, we herein used flow cytometry-based single cell network profiling (SCNP) assays to study cellular responses of primary human AML cells to GO. Our data indicate that the extent of DNA damage is quantitatively impacted by CD33 expression and drug efflux activity. However, although DNA damage is required for GO-induced cytotoxicity, it is not sufficient for effective cell kill, suggesting that downstream anti-apoptotic pathways may function as relevant resistance mechanisms. Supporting this notion, we found activated PI3K/AKT signaling to be associated with GO resistance in vitro in primary AML cells. Consistently, the investigational AKT inhibitor MK-2206 significantly sensitized various human AML cells to GO or free calicheamicin-gamma(1) with particularly pronounced effects in otherwise GO or free calicheamicin-gamma(1)-resistant cells. Likewise, MK-2206 also sensitized primary AML cells to calicheamicin-gamma(1). Together, our findings illustrate the capacity of SCNP assays to discover chemotherapy-related biological pathways and signaling networks relevant to GO-induced genotoxic stress. The identification of AKT signaling as being associated with GO resistance in vitro may provide a novel approach to improve the in vivo efficacy of GO/calicheamicin-gamma(1) and, by extrapolation, other DNA damage-based therapeutics.",,"['Nodality Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",,,,,,,"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA159285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA015704-35S6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA159285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3539972,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although AML cells express SIRPalpha, its function has not been investigated in these cells. In this study we aimed to determine the role of the SIRPalpha in acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of SIRPalpha, both on mRNA and protein level in AML patients and we further investigated whether the expression of SIRPalpha on two low SIRPalpha expressing AML cell lines could be upregulated upon differentiation of the cells. We determined the effect of chimeric SIRPalpha expression on tumor cell growth and programmed cell death by its triggering with an agonistic antibody in these cells. Moreover, we examined the efficacy of agonistic antibody in combination with established antileukemic drugs. RESULTS: By microarray analysis of an extensive cohort of primary AML samples, we demonstrated that SIRPalpha is differentially expressed in AML subgroups and its expression level is dependent on differentiation stage, with high levels in FAB M4/M5 AML and low levels in FAB M0-M3. Interestingly, AML patients with high SIRPalpha expression had a poor prognosis. Our results also showed that SIRPalpha is upregulated upon differentiation of NB4 and Kasumi cells. In addition, triggering of SIRPalpha with an agonistic antibody in the cells stably expressing chimeric SIRPalpha, led to inhibition of growth and induction of programmed cell death. Finally, the SIRPalpha-derived signaling synergized with the activity of established antileukemic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that triggering of SIRPalpha has antileukemic effect and may function as a potential therapeutic target in AML.",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,PMC3540026,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 14.,"PURPOSE: The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and differentiation during development. Whereas the Hedgehog pathway is inactive in most normal adult tissues, Hedgehog pathway reactivation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neoplasms including BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia. The clear link between the Hedgehog pathway and BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia led to an effort to identify small molecules to block the pathway. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the combined effects of vismodegib and ponatinib, a pan-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, in nonobese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) repopulating T315I BCR-ABL1-positive cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We observed that combination with vismodegib and ponatinib helps to eliminate therapy-resistant NOD/SCID repopulating T315I BCR-ABL1-positive cells. The percentage of CD19-positive leukemia cells in peripheral blood was significantly lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than that of the vehicle or ponatinib alone (P < 0.001). Spleen weights were also lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than in ponatinib alone (P < 0.05). Overall tumor burden, as assessed by BCR-ABL mRNA from bone marrow cells, was significantly lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than in ponatinib alone (P < 0.005). We also found that vismodegib significantly reduced BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cell self-renewal in vitro as well as during serial transplantation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The combination with a Smo inhibitor and ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors may help eliminate therapy-resistant T315I BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cells.

Using three different mouse models of myeloproliferative disorders, including mice with defective cholesterol efflux pathways and two models based on expression of human leukemia disease alleles, we uncovered a mechanism by which proliferating and inflammatory myeloid cells take up and oxidize glucose during the feeding period, contributing to energy dissipation and subsequent loss of adipose mass. In vivo, lentiviral inhibition of Glut1 by shRNA prevented myeloproliferation and adipose tissue loss in mice with defective cholesterol efflux pathway in leukocytes. Thus, Glut1 was necessary to sustain proliferation and potentially divert glucose from fat storage. We also showed that overexpression of the human ApoA-I transgene to raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels decreased Glut1 expression, dampened myeloproliferation, and prevented fat loss. These experiments suggest that inhibition of Glut-1 and HDL cholesterol-raising therapies could provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat the energy imbalance observed in myeloproliferative disorders.",,"['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",,,,,,,"['DK089503/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL054591/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54591/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK089503/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI061741/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI061741/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3570097,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 14.,"PURPOSE: In pediatric relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), optimal reinduction therapy is unknown. Studies suggest that liposomal daunorubicin (DNX; DaunoXome; Galen, Craigavon, United Kingdom) is effective and less cardiotoxic, which is important in this setting. These considerations led to a randomized phase III study by the International Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or primary refractory non-French-American-British type M3 AML who were younger than 21 years of age were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) or to FLAG plus DNX in the first reinduction course. The primary end point was status of the bone marrow (BM) sampled shortly before the second course of chemotherapy (the day 28 BM). Data are presented according to intention-to-treat for all 394 randomly assigned patients (median follow-up, 4.0 years). RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate was 64%, and the 4-year probability of survival (pOS) was 38% (SE, 3%). The day 28 BM status (available in 359 patients) was good (</= 20% leukemic blasts) in 80% of patients randomly assigned to FLAG/DNX and 70% for patients randomly assigned to FLAG (P = .04). Concerning secondary end points, the CR rate was 69% with FLAG/DNX and 59% with FLAG (P = .07), but overall survival was similar. However, core-binding factor (CBF) AML treated with FLAG/DNX resulted in pOS of 82% versus 58% with FLAG (P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity was essentially similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: DNX added to FLAG improves early treatment response in pediatric relapsed AML. Overall long-term survival was similar, but CBF-AML showed an improved survival with FLAG/DNX. International collaboration proved feasible and resulted in the best outcome for pediatric relapsed AML reported thus far.",,"['Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, NL-1081HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands. gjl.kaspers@vumc.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2013 Mar;10(3):122.

Epub 2013 Jan 14.,"PURPOSE: Complex karyotype (CK) is the poorest risk factor in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It has recently been reported that monosomal karyotype (MK) worsens the prognosis of patients with CK. PATIENTS AND METHODS; We analyzed 1,054 adult patients with MDS with an abnormal karyotype from the Spanish Registry of MDS. The aim of the study was to describe the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of MK; the main end points were overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival. RESULTS: MK was identified in 172 patients (16%), most of whom (88%) presented with CK. Variables significantly associated with OS were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; P < .001), bone marrow (BM) blast percentage (HR, 1.05; P < .001), hemoglobin level (HR, 1.71; P < .001), platelet count (HR, 1.41; P < .001), karyotype complexity (CK [three abnormalities]: HR, 1.81; P = .003; very CK [> three abnormalities]: HR, 2; P < .001), and abnormalities of chromosome 5 and/or 7 (HR, 1.89; P < .001). Variables significantly related to the risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were higher BM blast percentage (HR, 1.12; P < .001) and karyotype complexity (CK: HR, 2.53; P = .002; very CK: HR, 2.77; P < .001). CONCLUSION: After accounting for karyotype complexity, MK was not associated with OS or evolution to AML. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the prognostic value of MK in MDS is not independent and is mainly the result of its strong association with number of chromosomal abnormalities.",,"[""Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Pg.

Gleevec, a well-known therapeutic agent against chronic myelogenous leukemia, is an effective inhibitor of Abl tyrosine kinase. However, Gleevec fails to inhibit closely homologous tyrosine kinases, such as c-Src. Because many structural features of the binding site are conserved, the molecular determinants responsible for binding specificity are not immediately apparent. Some have attributed the difference in binding specificity of Gleevec to subtle variations in ligand-protein interactions (binding affinity control), whereas others have proposed that it is the conformation of the DFG motif, in which ligand binding is only accessible to Abl and not to c-Src (conformational selection control). To address this issue, the absolute binding free energy was computed using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. The results of the free energy simulations are in good agreement with experiments, thereby enabling a meaningful decomposition of the binding free energy to elucidate the factors controlling Gleevec's binding specificity. The latter is shown to be controlled by a conformational selection mechanism and also by differences in key van der Waals interactions responsible for the stabilization of Gleevec in the binding pocket of Abl.",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Gordon Center for Integrative Science, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 CA093577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029030/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CAO93577/PHS HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029030-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3562763,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested whether interference with alpha4-mediated stromal adhesion might be a new ALL treatment. Two models of leukemia were used, one genetic (conditional alpha4 ablation of BCR-ABL1 [p210(+)] leukemia) and one pharmacological (anti-functional alpha4 antibody treatment of primary ALL). Conditional deletion of alpha4 sensitized leukemia cell to nilotinib. Adhesion of primary pre-B ALL cells was alpha4-dependent; alpha4 blockade sensitized primary ALL cells toward chemotherapy.

In the present study, we interrogated the clonal architecture by mutation-specific discrimination analysis of single-cell-derived colonies in 28 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML), the most frequent MPN/MDS. This analysis reveals a linear acquisition of the studied mutations with limited branching through loss of heterozygosity. Serial analysis of untreated and treated samples demonstrates a dynamic architecture on which most current therapeutic approaches have limited effects. The main disease characteristics are early clonal dominance, arising at the CD34(+)/CD38(-) stage of hematopoiesis, and granulomonocytic differentiation skewing of multipotent and common myeloid progenitors. Comparison of clonal expansions of TET2 mutations in MDS, MPN, and CMML, together with functional invalidation of TET2 in sorted progenitors, suggests a causative link between early clonal dominance and skewed granulomonocytic differentiation. Altogether, early clonal dominance may distinguish CMML from other chronic myeloid neoplasms with similar gene mutations.",,"['Inserm UMR1009, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that rSj16 strongly suppressed the growth of murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. rSj16 induced apoptosis by increasing the proportion of sub-G1 apoptotic cells as well as causing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. The expressions of cyclin D1, D2, D3, and E, and Cdk 2, 4, and 6 genes in WEHI-3B JCS cells were significantly down-regulated at 24 h as measured by real-time PCR. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by rSj16 was confirmed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining assay and annexin V/propidium iodide double staining. A reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential indicated an active involvement of mitochondria in the apoptosis process. rSj16 treatment induced an increase in the activity of caspase 3, 6, and 9, and expression of pro-apoptotic Bax. Meanwhile, the decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was observed after rSj16 treatment. Taken together, our results implied that rSj16 can inhibit proliferation by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of murine myeloid leukemia cells via activation of the caspase-mediated mechanism by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family.",,"['Department of Parasitology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, Guangdong, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on analysis of cytokine expression profiles, type I interferon (IFN) mRNA is induced in host mouse livers at 1 hour post-injection. This type I IFN signaling amplifies cytokine expression in liver independent of the nature of vector DNA sequences after 3 hours post-injection. This type I IFN signaling in response to HDAds administration contributes to transcriptional silencing of both HDAd prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA in liver. This silencing occurs early and is mediated by epigenetic modification as shown by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with anti-histone deacetylase (HDAC) and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). In contrast, self-complementary adeno-associated viral vectors (scAAVs) showed significantly lower induction of type I IFN mRNA in liver compared to HDAds at both early and late time points. These results show that the type I IFN signaling dependent transgene silencing differs between AAV and HDAd vectors after liver-directed gene transfer.",,"['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,Texas 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,"['R01 AI051390/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 HL098692/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087836/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 HL098692/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI51390/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK067324/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK067324/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K99HL098692/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3616533,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Scl +40 enhancer is situated downstream of Map17, the 3' flanking gene of Scl, and is active in transgenic mice during primitive and definitive erythropoiesis. To analyze the in vivo function of the Scl +40 enhancer within the Scl/Map17 transcriptional domain, we deleted this element in the germ line. Scl(Delta40/Delta40) mice were viable with reduced numbers of erythroid CFU in both bone marrow and spleen yet displayed a normal response to stress hematopoiesis. Analysis of Scl(Delta40/Delta40) embryonic stem (ES) cells revealed impaired erythroid differentiation, which was accompanied by a failure to upregulate Scl when erythropoiesis was initiated. Map17 expression was also reduced in hematopoietic tissues and differentiating ES cells, and the Scl +40 element was able to enhance activity of the Map17 promoter. However, only Scl but not Map17 could rescue the Scl(Delta40/Delta40) ES phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that the Scl +40 enhancer is an erythroid cell-specific enhancer that regulates the expression of both Scl and Map17.

Epub 2013 Jan 15.,"The lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) tethers the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL1) protein complex to chromatin. Likewise, LEDGF/p75 tethers the HIV-1 pre-integration complex to chromatin. We previously demonstrated that expression of the C-terminal fragment fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (eGFP-LEDGF(325-530)) impaired HIV-1 replication. Here, we explored this strategy to selectively interfere with the leukemogenic activity of MLL-fusion proteins. We found that expression of LEDGF(325-530) impaired the clonogenic growth of MLL-fusion gene transformed human and mouse hematopoietic cells, without affecting the growth of control cells immortalized by the FLT3-ITD mutant or normal lineage-marker-depleted murine bone marrow cells. Expression of LEDGF(325-530) was associated with downregulation of the MLL target Hoxa9 and impaired cell cycle progression. Structure-function analysis revealed two small eGFP-fused LEDGF/p75 peptides, LEDGF(424-435) and LEDGF(375-386) phenocopying these effects. Both LEDGF(325-530) and the smaller active peptides were able to disrupt the LEDGF/p75-MLL interaction. Expression of LEDGF(325-530) or LEDGF(375-386) fragments increased the latency period to disease development in vivo in a mouse bone marrow transplant model of MLL-AF9-induced AML. We conclude that small peptides disrupting the LEDGF/p75-MLL interface have selective anti-leukemic activity providing a direct rationale for the design of small molecule inhibitors targeting this interaction.",,"[""Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital and Children's Hospital Base(UKBB) ZLF, Lab 318, Basel, Switzerland.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we sought to identify agents that synergistically enhance parthenolide's cytotoxicity. Using a high-throughput combination drug screen, we identified the anti-hyperglycemic, vildagliptin, which synergized with parthenolide to induce death of the leukemia stem cell line, TEX (combination index (CI)=0.36 and 0.16, at effective concentration (EC) 50 and 80, respectively; where CI <1 denotes statistical synergy). The combination of parthenolide and vildagliptin reduced the viability and clonogenic growth of cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients and had limited effects on the viability of normal human peripheral blood stem cells. The basis for synergy was independent of vildagliptin's primary action as an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV. Rather, using chemical and genetic approaches we demonstrated that the synergy was due to inhibition of the related enzymes DPP8 and DPP9. In summary, these results highlight DPP8 and DPP9 inhibition as a novel chemosensitizing strategy in leukemia cells. Moreover, these results suggest that the combination of vildagliptin and parthenolide could be useful for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['School of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. paul.spagnuolo@uwaterloo.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 1990-2009 death certificates estimating age-standardized rates. We calculated the Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) using the Joinpoint Regression program available at the National Cancer Institute to assess tendency. RESULTS: Cancer mortality rates increased. AAPC were 0.87% male and 0.96% female children, and for adolescents were: males 1.22% and females 0.63%. The neoplasm pattern in infants was leukemia -central nervous system- lymphomas; and in adolescents it was leukemia -bone and articulation- lymphomas. The increase in cancer mortality corresponded to the high and highest marginated areas of each state. CONCLUSION: The increase in highly marginated areas may be partly explained by well-documented local registration of deaths.

Detailed monitoring of the therapeutic arsenic and its metabolites in various accessible specimens of APL patients can contribute to improving treatment efficacy and minimizing arsenic-induced side effects. This article focuses on the determination of arsenic species in saliva samples from APL patients undergoing arsenic treatment. Saliva samples were collected from nine APL patients over three consecutive days. The patients received 10 mg arsenic trioxide each day via intravenous infusion. The saliva samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Monomethylarsonous acid and monomethylmonothioarsonic acid were identified along with arsenite, dimethylarsinic acid, monomethylarsonic acid, and arsenate. Arsenite was the predominant arsenic species, accounting for 71.8 % of total arsenic in the saliva. Following the arsenic infusion each day, the percentage of methylated arsenicals significantly decreased, possibly suggesting that the arsenic methylation process was saturated by the high doses immediately after the arsenic infusion. The temporal profiles of arsenic species in saliva following each arsenic infusion over 3 days have provided information on arsenic exposure, metabolism, and excretion. These results suggest that saliva can be used as an appropriate clinical biomarker for monitoring arsenic species in APL patients.",,"['Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada.']",,,,,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3565090,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 11.,"Identification of chromosomal abnormalities is mandatory for classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the abnormalities have to be determined quickly, to allow patient enrollment in multicenter protocols and/or for selecting therapeutic strategies. Rapid AML molecular diagnosis is often difficult to achieve, however, because it is based on numerous different RT-PCR protocols. We developed a new RT-PCR method, one that does not require a nested step, to simultaneously detect all AML fusion transcripts from six major recurrent translocations found in adults: t(15;17)(q22;q12), inv(16)(p13.1q22) [t(16;16)(p13.1;q22)], t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(6;9)(p23;q34), t(9;22)(q34;q11), and t(10;11)(p13;q14). Specific primers for RT-PCR detection of the 24 fusion transcripts, along with two transcripts for controls, were designed for this 26-plex RT-PCR. Each PCR product had a different size and was separated by capillary electrophoresis. We also designed a multiplex positive control with 24 chimeric RNAs, corresponding to all chimeric RNAs tested. Compared with classical molecular biology protocols and cytogenetic analyses used as reference standards, results of the 26-plex RT-PCR method were concordant in all 204 (100%) cases of adult AML tested. Results were obtained in less than 24 hours. Because of the multiplex positive control, interpretation of the peaks was very easy, without any ambiguity. The tumor cell detection threshold was 1.5%.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2013 Jan 14.,"The tyrosine kinase c-Abl (or Abl) and the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 cooperatively activate the transcription factor p73 by enhancing recruitment of the acetyltransferase p300. As the transcription factor c-Myc (or Myc) is a known target of Pin1 and p300, we hypothesized that it might be regulated in a similar manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of Pin1 augmented the interaction of Myc with p300 and transcriptional activity. The action of Abl, however, was more complex than predicted. On one hand, Abl indirectly enhanced phosphorylation of Myc on Ser 62 and Thr 58, its association with Pin1 and p300 and its acetylation by p300. These effects of Abl were exerted through phosphorylation of substrate(s) other than Myc itself. On the other hand, Abl interacted with the C-terminal domain of Myc and phosphorylated up to five tyrosine residues in its N-terminus, the principal of which was Y74. Indirect immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining suggested that the Y74-phosphorylated form of Myc (Myc-pY74) localized to the cytoplasm and coexisted either with active Abl in a subset of mammary carcinomas or with Bcr-Abl in chronic myeloid leukemia. In all instances, Myc-pY74 constituted a minor fraction of the cellular Myc protein. Thus, our data unravel two potential effects of Abl on Myc: first, Abl signaling can indirectly augment acetylation of Myc by p300, and most likely also its transcriptional activity in the nucleus; second, Abl can directly phosphorylate Myc on tyrosine: the resulting form of Myc appears to be cytoplasmic, and its presence correlates with Abl activation in cancer.",,"['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology (IEO), Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,['R01 CA020525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3914638,['NIHMS549263'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multivariate analysis, the lack of a 3-month CCyR to 2nd-TKI therapy was selected as the only independent factor associated with poor event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4.5; P < .001) and overall survival (5.4; P = .03). RESULTS: The 3-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 74% and 43%, respectively, for patients with 3-month CCyR, and were 98% and 79%, respectively, for patients without 3-month CCyR. In a multivariate analysis, high hemoglobin level, previous major cytogenetic response to imatinib therapy, and </=90% Philadelphia-positive metaphases were associated with the achievement of a 3-month CCyR. CONCLUSION: The achievement of a 3-month CCyR is the only predictor of outcome in patients treated with 2nd-TKI therapy after imatinib failure. Patients with <3-month CCyR may not obtain long-term benefit and should be followed-up closely.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
